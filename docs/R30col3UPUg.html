href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And today I'm going to be presenting on building applications with AI agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just as a brief bio, I've been at Microsoft for about two years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been one of the key contributors to security copilot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the recently announced security copilot agents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically working in the cybersecurity division.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Before that I spent four years working on machine learning at Uber,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of big geospatial problems, and I was in startups before that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this talk is really a distillation of a 300-page book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that I have coming out with O'Reilly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first seven chapters are already up on early release on the platform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it is going to print next month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And while I'll be focusing mostly on slides, I won't get too deep into code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for this particular talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to say that there is full code examples backing everything I'm describing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to dive in a little bit deeper, take a look at what this looks like in actual code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is to give you a brief introduction to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So to give a brief overview of what I'll be covering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be talking a little bit about the promise and obstacles that we're seeing so far in agentic development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll go through some of the core components that are required to build really effective AI systems that we get to production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll talk through some of the common pitfalls and lessons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a tremendous amount of excitement that's happening here to just take one data point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we look at the companies that have been accepted to Y Combinator just over the last three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we've seen a 254% increase in companies that are describing themselves as agentic or as if they're building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly we're seeing a lot of increased investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of excitement here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think we're also seeing that these are really hard problems that we're going after.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if we're looking at some of the leading agentic benchmarks from academia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we're seeing these are hard tasks that require a sequence of multiple tool calls, multiple executions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and really operating in complex environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we were to go back five or 10 years, we'd be in the single digits on some of these tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the fact that we're getting up to in the 50s, 60s, and 70s on some of this is really impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think just as Clay described, we want to move to where the puck is moving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's actually accelerating in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're going and trying to build your own agentic system, do not expect perfection by any measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're seeing it's quite easy to get to those initial prototype stages that might get you to 70% accuracy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's increasingly challenging to go after that long tail of increasingly complex scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to give a brief definition to start, I'm sure you've heard a few of these at the conference so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm defining it as an entity that can reason, act, communicate, and adapt to solve tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we treat the foundation model as a foundation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can add these additional components to increase the performance and effectiveness in different scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been a lot of discussion about what constitutes an agentic system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think Andrew Eng helped clarify this, that it's not a binary distinction, but it really is a continuum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It really is a spectrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I would add on to that is there's a second axis that we should consider, which is the effectiveness of the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I wouldn't think about agency or the agenticness of your system as a goal or an end in and of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a tool to help you solve problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just think it's a classic example of something that has a very low degree of agency, but a really high degree of efficacy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's robotic process automation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a previous generation of automation that's been incredibly helpful and incredibly useful and is used by many companies and delivers a lot of economic value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is those types of automations are fixed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're brittle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Small changes to the input can allow the entire thing to break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it requires a lot of manual intervention to continue maintaining and updating these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think part of the promise as we move to these more agentic systems is they're flexible, they're adaptable, and they unlock this additional capability of adapting to and responding to those changing inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we want to make sure that any time we're adding agency to our system when we're moving along the right, we're staying at that very high level of effectiveness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure that any incremental addition towards agency maintains that high level of performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What we don't want to do is end up compromising the degree of effectiveness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's no shortage of bad chatbots that we've seen shipped by many companies that are relatively low on efficacy and relatively low on agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we also want to avoid our going out over our skis, building agentic systems that are low in efficacy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I would call the future news stories that all of us want to avoid so that as we're designing things, we're delivering things that are delivering value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll start with tool use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just want to say this is a really -- it's such a powerful idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really simple in principle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're working with foundation models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These are autoregressive generative models that are predicting one token at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, those are predicting natural language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But they can also output function calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you're exposing tools and functionality to this language model in the attribute that we are calling an entity, all of a sudden that agent can now invoke functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're now exposing the full range of tools that we can expose over APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just think about the incredible functionality that you can expose to this, but also the risk and challenge that comes along with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it requires a great degree of discernment and responsibility to think about which of those functionalities we're going to expose and in what way so that we can deliver values to our customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, this also operates in a loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we apply that parser to the outputted text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We invoke the tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we get some response back, some observation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a way of providing more information to the agent that it can use to solve problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We then continue this in a loop until we take our final output and we generate that for the customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you're thinking about designing and building tools, one really common fallacy I see is to think that there's a one-to-one mapping between your APIs and your tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're working in an organization that has 300 APIs, please do not register 300 tools with your agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will get really confused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And something we've seen empirically is that the more tools that you expose to an individual prompt, to an individual completion call, the less accuracy you see overall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's more semantic collision between those different tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if at all possible, reduce the number of tools that you're exposing at a single time and really try and group them together in logical ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to keep that scope really specific, really clear, specific names and descriptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those tools should really feel like a single human-facing action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that you've exposed this rich functionality and tools to your agent, you need to think about how you're going to invoke it and what the orchestration pattern is going to look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would recommend that you keep it simple.</span></div><div

be done with these standard workflow patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will make it easier to measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will keep your costs down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will keep your reliability up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will allow you to deliver value for customers more easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can also apply different types of branching logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can rely on the LLM to choose which path through the tree that you might want to go through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I work in cybersecurity and applying these types of patterns work really nicely for deciding what the severity of an incident is, what additional information we need to enrich in performing and going through that multi-hop enrichment and reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's incredibly valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Moving through to a full agentic pattern is putting more power into the hands of the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're relying on it to choose which actions to invoke and do that repeatedly in order to solve some work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just harder to measure and it's harder to get full performance out of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But remember the bitter lesson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are getting to a point where your chains and the trees that you're building out are becoming so complex and so convoluted and they're difficult to maintain, that's probably a sign that you want to move to a more agentic pattern that will make it easier to maintain long-term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it might be something that you might want to start considering doing some additional fine-tuning on your model for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other pattern that we found to be incredibly useful and I think we'll see scale in the future is too many teams are relying on the large language model to apply the logic that they want to have applied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have some fixed business logic, if you only want to take an action if A, B, and C are correct, what you can do is expose tools to your agent to update each of those states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can apply sanitization and validation on each of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You keep your logic in deterministic fixed business logic that you can maintain over time and you maintain the state external to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that way you can ensure that the correct actions are only taken when those conditions are met.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also been a real interest in moving from single agent to multi-agent systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the best reason that I know to break down a single agent system to a multi-agent system is exactly that problem I was describing earlier with tool calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you just start dumping too many tools into a single prompt, it will get overwhelmed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can break down those larger groups of tools into semantically similar groups, register it with an individual agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then rely on this coordinator to route to the appropriate agent to handle that task is a great way to continue to scale as your number of tools grows so you can handle a wider variety of scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also been a lot of talk about the agent to agent protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a really exciting future direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the successful multi-agent systems that I've seen have been built by an individual team that is able to coordinate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what agent to agent protocol is really reaching towards and aiming towards is a future where different teams building different agents are able to discover and coordinate and work together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we will see more of that, but it's really early days and there's plenty of additional technical and security questions to work through for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This brings us to evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My general recommendation, both for my team and I think for just about everyone, is invest more in evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's gotten so easy to build and it is very easy to get to your 70% or 80% accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are so many hyperperimeters to choose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How many agents?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How many tools do you expose?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which model do you use?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What type of memory do I want to use?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of those questions are almost impossible to answer without a high quality rigorous evaluation set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really encourage everyone to focus more time on this than you think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And really, it's moving us towards a type of test-driven development with agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your agent then becomes defined in terms of the inputs and the outputs that you're expecting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a whole range of tools that you can use to then automatically improve relative to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So labeling, I think, is a bit of a bad word from all of our time in machine learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the thing that we outsourced to Mechanical Turk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And really, the AI architects and the AI engineers who are building agents, you really need to take more ownership and responsibility of exactly what you want your agent to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so spending time defining those inputs and outputs can really help accelerate your team in making all of those hard questions as you move forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the ground is changing under us in terms of models and

sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's this whole rich set of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So besides automatic prompt optimization, automatic prompt engineering, we also have trace, textgrad, dspy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of these allow you to set hyperparameters and calculate gradients using a foundation model as a judge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can look at your failures and automatically suggest changes back through your flows to automatically improve your system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of you manually looking at examples and having to say, well, maybe this thing will work and I'll run it through,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of development by anecdote happening right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just encourage all of us that as we build up these evaluation sets and run and batch and start analyzing at the aggregate level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it allows us to make more intelligent steps to take the parallel over to optimizing a neural network model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">slightly larger batches will help us take more accurate steps towards the global minimum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This brings us to observability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the iceberg is a fantastic metaphor here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're working with generative models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're very good at generating content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a very good thing, but it also is a real challenge for us as we're thinking about evaluating these systems at scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as soon as you deploy these and get this out into the hands of customers, it becomes really hard to understand what's actually happening out there and really understanding the full range of failures and use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I encourage you to use tools like open LLMetry and open telemetry integrations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You really want to have detailed logs and tracing and probably some way of doing additional clustering and automated summarization to understand those main categories of failure modes so that you can optimize and improve your system more easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now this brings us to just a few of the common pitfalls that we've seen both internally and also speaking with folks outside of Microsoft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just insufficient evals is far and away the biggest limitation and challenge that I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But also on the tool side, maybe you haven't built enough tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the descriptions are not sufficiently accurate or clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe there's too high a degree of semantic overlap between your tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so individual completion calls are getting confused between those tools and leading to worse outcomes than you suspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then excessive complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so many bells and whistles these days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy to go chasing these other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just encourage us all to stay really focused on the principles, really focused on what we're trying to achieve, and only add additional complexity if we've actually tested and make sure that it's actually providing for a better experience for our users and customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this lack of learning, so tightening up the learning loop is really challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this content makes it hard to sift through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so really focusing on getting down to those root causes and suggesting improvements that will result in a better system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the final thing I'll add is coming from the cybersecurity division, this is such an exciting time for this technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's going to help us in so many ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But agentic systems are a new class of potential vulnerability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just encourage all of us to really design for safety at every layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pirate can definitely help on many layers of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But just good software engineering and good principles are really critical for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And make sure that you're building tripwires and detectors at different stages of your agentic stack so that you can eject out and fall back to human review in all of the critical cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this brings me to the end of my talk, and I think I'll just close with a quote that I love from Paul Krugman that productivity isn't everything, but in the long run, it is almost everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A country's ability to prove its standards of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I really think we're at the beginning of an upshift in the amount of work that every single one of us can accomplish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this new design pattern for agents is going to help each of us accomplish more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm really excited about what we're going to be able to do together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30col3UPUg&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div
