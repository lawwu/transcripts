Number two, knowledge increases sorrow because the more we know, the more we know of suffering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a fallen world.

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He carried so much in himself and he wanted them to know so much, and it was a burden that they learn this and live this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fourth, knowledge increases sorrow because we're compelled to change our ideas when we learn some things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And jumping from that little boat I talked about, the little boat of knowledge that you're sailing on into the sea of what you don't know, sometimes you got to leap out of the boat because it turns out to be wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sailing the wrong theological boat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's just a little raft of truth out there and you got to leap for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You get splinters in your hands and your ego, and that's painful to have to change your thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I wept my eyes out in the fall of 1968 as my theology was crumbling and needing to be rebuilt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very painful thing to walk through transformations of what you think you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last one I thought of was knowledge increases sorrow because the more we know, the more dementia will take away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A mind full of great truth from God's Word and God's world will feel the sting of senility more keenly than the mind that has less to lose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes, Hemingway, much wisdom increases vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the message of the Bible is that it's worth it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's worth the sorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The summons of the Bible everywhere is get knowledge, get understanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible never says run away from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It warns you of the pain, but it never says turn and run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding, yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4zNlQ8TIz8&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's hardly a warning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
