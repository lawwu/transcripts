America needs defense companies in order to maintain its defense. And the problem right now that we have is there's these five prime companies that are antiquated and really expensive. And we need startup disruptors to that. So I'm not morally opposed to it.</p><p>In fact, I think it's probably a good thing. I think my concern would be I don't really want to be part of the military industrial complex. I feel like it might corrupt my views on things. No, you'd want war, you'd be girding for war. That's your dimension. Right. I think it's more incentive to be like these generals who go on CNN and Fox News and justify every single war.</p><p>That's my biggest fear as well. It's one thing to be investing in a bunch of companies where we're sitting around hoping for cheaper clicks on Facebook and Google. It's an entirely other thing to sit on the board of a company and hope for war. That's a horrible place to be.</p><p>If you believe that America should be the most important country in the world and you have the ability to help it be that, eventually some of those decisions will come in contact with this kind of decision.</p></div></div></body></html>
