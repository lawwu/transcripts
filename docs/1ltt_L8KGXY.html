I love Animal Farm. I've read it many, many, many, many times. It just connects to something deep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1224">00:20:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love people that are able to, through minimum amount of words, convey something deeply honest about the human condition, about human nature, whether it's the dark side or the beautiful aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1236">00:20:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love The Stranger by Camus.

Dostoevsky's The Idiot by a far my favorite Dostoevsky novel. It could be one of my favorite novels, but I don't usually recommend it because maybe you're not into memorizing 1,000 Russian names and keeping track of a bunch of weaving narratives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1263">00:21:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just aspire to be philosophically somebody like the main character, which is Prince Mishkin, aka The Idiot. The naive nature of his optimism is something I aspire to, and a lot of people in the book criticize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1280">00:21:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's the one that says beauty will save the world, and the characters criticize that. I think it's unclear whether the naivety that he has is supposed to be positive or negative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1295">00:21:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the struggle of the book. To me, I would err on the side of the naive positivity, appreciation of beauty, and longing for love. I agree with Dilan very much that reading is a superpower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1313">00:21:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've talked to Jim Keller a bunch of times, and every time I've talked to him, I've learned 10x more than I would ever learn about him in any other way. Engineering discussions with experts is just incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1334">00:22:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you a robot? Would you take no for an answer? For me, reading is definitely a shortcut to learning. I'm a huge believer in reading. There are so many different paths and trajectories you can take through the reading space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1355">00:22:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can learn about human nature through reading history. You can read business books, which are full of cliches and advice books. But when you cut through all the bullshit, there are kernels of advice that can shake up your mind and truly help you discover yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1382">00:23:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, I get a little bit distracted every once in a while. There are also just technical books, or popular versions of technical books like something by Sean Carroll, or even sapiens, like looking at evolutionary biology view of life, or anything by Richard Dawkins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1399">00:23:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those kinds of things give you another perspective on humanity, and somehow that kind of percolates down to your own life as well. Lex, maybe you can turn on the slow chat mode? That's one of the folks from our team. I don't even know how to do that, man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1421">00:23:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm barely hanging on here and I'm still scared shitless. Okay. Favorite book? I don't know, I keep changing. I would say The Idiot, number one. Animal Farm, number two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1435">00:23:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, so let me click on Super Chats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1448">00:24:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know what, I'm just going to trust my team of incredible folks.

The very thing I said that's the great advice, the flaw of being unwilling to fit in, which makes him difficult to talk to because he's constantly challenging the small talk of our daily existence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1700">00:28:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Love, of course.

To me, it's a flaw because allowing yourself to be fragile, to the ups and downs of attachment to others, to love, I think is truly fulfilling and makes you a better engineer and better entrepreneur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1758">00:29:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is when you feel the world heavily, when you feel the connection to others, when that ultimately is lost or is damaged or is hurt, again, the ups and downs of love, that's going to really hurt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1776">00:29:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That pain is not productive in terms of launching rockets to space. I think one of the things that Elon is better than anybody I've ever met is whenever there's tragic events, whenever there's difficult events, whenever there's emergencies, he's able to think clearly and say, "Okay, well, this happened. What is the right next step to take to solve this problem?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1796">00:29:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not meandering about the negativity around, "Oh, why did this happen?" in terms of the unproductive why.

That's why I love running. I hate running. It tests my mind. I get on the road, and one mile in, all the demons I have, "Why aren't you having you done this and that and all the things that you said you're going to do, you told yourself you're going to do, you haven't done it yet. Why are you still single?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1864">00:31:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are you... Why is your... Where are the robots? You love robots. Let's get them running around Austin." All the productivity questions, all that is just, "What are you doing with your life?" And then the questions of mortality, all that comes out one mile in. If we're being honest, it's a half a mile in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1883">00:31:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that process, that's why I love... I'm pooping, Lex. Congratulations, sir or madam. I congratulate you. I hope it goes well for you. That's why I both love and hate running. And so for me, the race itself is not important, the ultra marathon race.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1900">00:31:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But David Goggins, whatever we do, whether it's on road, I don't want to do a treadmill thing with him. I just love nature. So I want to go out outside. Whatever we do, I think I can break him or break myself in the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1919">00:31:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was out in Vegas doing pushups with him, I think I legitimately thought I could do more pushups in my drunk madness than David Goggins. So I'm excited for the possibility of facing him and running. Not really a competition with David, of course. It's a competition with myself and seeing how far I can go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1939">00:32:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The longest I've ever run is 22 miles in one take. I've done the 4x4x48, but one take is 22 miles. And that actually I had to quit because I didn't get enough salt and water. It's just I started shivering. And yeah, I want to see how far I can go, how much pain I can take. So definitely will happen this year. And we'll do a podcast before and after.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1966">00:32:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey Lex, if you want to turn on slow mode, just go to settings, live chat, toggle on slow mode. I thought me speaking slowly is already activating slow mode. You get it? I don't know where the settings button is, bro. Okay, let's just leave it at this. We'll do slow mode next time if that's a beneficial thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=1990">00:33:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2003">00:33:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">David Fravor. Leah asks, you're amazing Lex. Love you. Love you too. Thanks for this interview. In interview number four, are you going to talk about David Fravor's UFOs? Thanks for the 42 question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2026">00:33:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a little puzzled by you and your question, Leah27. But anyway, I will talk about UFOs a bunch more. I just want to, you know, I honestly want to talk to Bob Lazar. I haven't really reached out. He was interested. I like the human side of things too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2042">00:34:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the thing I'm interested with Alex Jones too. It's not so much the conspiracy theories and all those kinds of things. It's how does this affect your mind? Having these ideas in your head, how does it affect your mind? How are you able to still have compassion for other human beings? Still have an inkling of optimism about the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2063">00:34:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same with Bob Lazar. David Fravor, probably we'll talk again. Alex, I forgot her name. I apologize. I'm so bad with names, but she's another pilot that saw what David saw. I'll definitely do a podcast with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2080">00:34:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in general, I just, right. In general, I just love, obviously I love UFOs. So it inspires me. I don't think a lot of people have a conversation about it. Like it's a cynical thing about government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2096">00:34:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for me, I love UFOs because it inspires me of the possibilities of both the intelligent life that's out there, all the possible things we can understand about ourselves and about the world and about the universe from interacting with them, for searching for them, for trying to communicate with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2114">00:35:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then very practical engineering aspects of just knowing that something is possible. It would allow us to engineer propulsion systems that can move much faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2124">00:35:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So on this topic, Lex Xylex asks, there's so many X's in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2131">00:35:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Xylex asks, Lex, do you think Elon has witnessed any high forms of technology he cannot publicly disclose through SpaceX?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2142">00:35:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's possible. And it's also possible that I know the answer to this question. But if I told you, Xylex, I would have to kill you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2156">00:35:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me take a sip of this before I read a question about Jordan Peterson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2165">00:36:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Big fan of caffeine, caffeine all the way. The one drug I truly, truly appreciate and partake in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2174">00:36:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Vodka every once in a while, caffeine every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2180">00:36:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, Jordan Peterson, Scott McBlane asks, hey Lex, smiley face, will you ever have Jordan Peterson on the podcast?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2187">00:36:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for all your work. You make my life better. Thank you, brother. Thank you, Scott.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2192">00:36:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, definitely. I've talked to Jordan offline a bunch of times. We'll definitely do a podcast together. I think it'll be epic. There's no rush.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2201">00:36:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my concern with Jordan always is to make sure that he's healthy, happy and just like all people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2210">00:36:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's had a difficult year. And I don't know, who cares about podcasts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2216">00:36:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well being, health is more important than anything else. And I think he has a like a heck of a crazy tour coming up this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2226">00:37:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually have tickets to see him. I'm sure he'll do a few podcasts. But you know, with a tour like that, I wish him Godspeed and the best of luck and just stay healthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2237">00:37:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Stay focused. Stay optimistic. And just, I mean, he could do so much good in this world by thinking through the problems of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2247">00:37:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And walking again, gracefully through the fire. And I wish him the best of luck. I think we'll have a conversation unlike the others he's had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2256">00:37:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'd like to have a very long one with him, three, four hours, probably several times in our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2261">00:37:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One, I wanted to be a psychiatrist. I'm fascinated by the psychology side of things. So a real psychology conversation. Carl Jung. I have trouble speaking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2271">00:37:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the psychology side, from Freud to Jung and all those kinds of things to the philosopher side, to the communist question of Gulags and Solzhenitsyn to Stalin to Hitler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2286">00:38:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like history, human nature, human condition discussion. I'm not interested in identity politics of the day. I'm not interested in that bickering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2296">00:38:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I let other people are much better than me at this and at most things, but this certainly. And wokeism, all those kinds of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2305">00:38:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not, I think those are the battles of the day that will pass. And what will remain are the same lessons of history that we can learn today by thinking about history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2315">00:38:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to me, with Jordan Peterson, the interesting discussion is about communism, about what went wrong. Why? What can go wrong again?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2325">00:38:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, the interesting tension is between the man's search for meaning, because for him, that journey, that search, in part goes through religious thought, religious exploration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2340">00:39:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really interesting because I don't even know what religion and spirituality means. It's such a beautiful space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2351">00:39:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I never liked sort of hardcore atheism or obviously hardcore religious thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2360">00:39:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's something in the middle there in that gray area, in that fog of where many people find meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2370">00:39:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot to be discovered. And I love the conversation he had with Sam Harris about the topic, the tension, through the tension over that discussion, you could discover something new together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2379">00:39:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's actually the best of conversations. Jordan 15396, ah, that Jordan, asks, "What would you do with a week left to live?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2399">00:39:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I meditate on death a lot. So I often think I'm going to die today. I enjoy that. I'm truly happy that this live stream I could do with today and die right after. I'm happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2416">00:40:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can genuinely say that I prefer to not die mid-sentence. People can quote me on the last thing I said in the last stream. I hope that live stream wasn't me quoting the person that was pooping and complimenting on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2435">00:40:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But other than that, I just, every day I contemplate if this is the last day of my life, am I happy? And the answer to that has been unequivocally yes for the longest time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2451">00:40:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So with a week left to live, I would probably spend it in silence with the people I love. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2475">00:41:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would also spend it thinking, because unlike the thought experiment of dying today, this is reality. So it's going to hit even harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2491">00:41:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would see what are the thoughts, sort of introspect. What are the thoughts, possibly with the help of psychedelics. That would be interesting actually. DMT, definitely. Pretty Girl. Elon Musk says Pretty Girl. Fake Elon Musk says Pretty Girl.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2508">00:41:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty Girl and the Hood of a Cadillac. Yeah, that's the office song. Free Love, Freeway. You guys should check it out. It's the most ridiculous song.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2520">00:42:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I definitely, probably with the Pretty Girl I love, hopefully I would be in a relationship at that point. But if I die today, there's plenty of people I love in my life. I would spend time with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2531">00:42:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sergey, who's on the team, he's the Russian guy, says the right answer is edit the fucking podcast. That's right, Sergey. Edit the podcast is what you would do when there's only one week left. That's called dedication. I love you, brother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2547">00:42:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. I'll wrap up soon. So I had a few questions about Tim Dillon. Let me say I think there's a podcast coming out with Tim Dillon on the Tim Dillon show on Monday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2567">00:42:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he said he came down to my place. We recorded a conversation together. And I'm a huge fan of his. I did a podcast. He was on the Lex podcast that I do. I really enjoyed that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2580">00:43:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the reason I wanted to do a conversation with him, first of all, he's a friend. He's somebody who inspires me. I disagree with him, obviously, on a lot of things. But he masterfully puts my ego in check and the ego of a ton of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2600">00:43:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The powerful. And that's really important. And to do it with grace, with mastery of comedy, it's really good. I, in general, like I said on the podcast, smart people that act silly versus silly people that act smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2618">00:43:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I don't know if I'm smart, but I will always err on the side of the silly. And to me, just being silly, not taking myself seriously, not ever taking myself seriously, being able to take a joke is essential for to see clearly through the fog of all the uncertainty that is around us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2642">00:44:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easy to delude yourself to think you really understand things, that you can see the truth. You have to have humility that you will never be in possession of the truth. You can only get closer and closer. And that humility, to me, is an essential element of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2657">00:44:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the moment you start taking yourself seriously, you start liking the sound of your own voice, as I say on a freaking live stream. The moment you start to fall in love with yourself in a way that just deludes you is the moment you become arrogant and are no longer to be able to discover the truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2678">00:44:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, Tim Dillon is essential for that. He was pretty rough on me in a few spots. I'm sure people are going to make fun of me, of the silly things I said on there, but I deserve it all. I will always deserve it. And bring it on, internet. That's why I love the internet. Hold truth to power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2697">00:44:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will always err on the side of silly. In fact, one of the things that I've been able to do more and more lately, and one of the things that Elon inspires me to do is be silly. Don't take yourself or the world seriously. Laugh. Laugh at the whole thing, at the whole absurdity of it. It'll be over before you know it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2718">00:45:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fuck, it's going to be over before you know it. Who's your favorite comedian? Am Johnson asks, who is your favorite comedian? Oh, yeah, Sergey says it's on topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2733">00:45:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have so many, obviously you don't want to pick. Each one has... I just love comedy. There's so many amazing... it's really unfair. So I can pick a favorite book, I can pick a favorite song even. It'd be tough, but I can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2758">00:45:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With comedians, it's very difficult. So obviously since I'm appearing on Tim Dillon's show, he is by far the greatest comedian of all time. So we're really saying who's the number two. Because by far, Tim Dillon is the greatest comedian of all time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2775">00:46:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the most valuable person of all time is Ben, his producer. Tim Dillon does zero work, contributes nothing to the show really. The most important person ever, arguably. So you have Gandhi and so on. But above that is Ben, the producer for the Tim Dillon show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2791">00:46:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Aside from that, obviously Joe Rogan has been a huge inspiration to me in a million ways. And I've talked about it endlessly. Mitch Hedberg in terms of one-liners, just fucking genius. Just... and we lose him too early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2810">00:46:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm gonna get emotional here. Louis CK, just like... the dark humor of Louis CK, unparalleled. I just... I mean, it reminds me of the Russian humor. It's the darkness, but done so masterfully that it brings out somehow an optimism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2835">00:47:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Mark Norman is actually an example of somebody like that. We just had a podcast together. He's got that Mitch Hedberg vibe, but he goes even darker, which I love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2847">00:47:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I think Norm MacDonald, somebody... so there's like stand-up comedy and there's what those stand-up comics do outside of that. Because you can't just take in one. Norm MacDonald is just a genius.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2863">00:47:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody actually made a comment about the Michael Malice conversation about Norm MacDonald. Maybe I can try to find the quote. He tweeted this in 2018. God damn it. Like, just the grace with which he left this world, telling no one. The genius.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2886">00:48:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, he tweeted, "The idiot sees the world as good versus evil. The cynic sees the world as evil versus evil. The truth that no one seems able to see is that the world is and always has been a battle of good versus good."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2904">00:48:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Norm MacDonald, ladies and gentlemen. So the brilliance of that statement is that... I mean, the idiot is a word I like because I think it fills me with humility, so setting that aside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2919">00:48:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we often frame things, you know, when we beat the drums of war, it's good versus evil. We're the good guys and we have to fight the words of the evil, the actions of the evil, the Nazis, the terrorists, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2935">00:48:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can go on. And those drums of war are beating now with Russia, with China. And again, I think we should lead with humility and compassion first, even in the face of atrocities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2951">00:49:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, the cynic just gives up and saying it's basically the powerful, the evil versus evil, the power centers of the world battling each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2961">00:49:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think Norm is absolutely correct that it is good versus good because the truth behind that statement is that each of the individual centers of power and the leaders think that they're doing the right thing for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2975">00:49:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hitler thought he was doing the good, the right thing for the world. Stalin thought he was doing the good, the right thing for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2981">00:49:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We Americans, when we go to war, think we're doing the right thing. Israel-Palestine conflict, both sides think they're doing the good thing for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=2990">00:49:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's good versus good. And all the atrocities of the world, I think, have been committed in part as a battle of good versus good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3004">00:50:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the tragic, the difficult aspect that we have to acknowledge about human nature, is that all of us think we're the good guys and we're doing the good thing. But we have to have the humility to question, are we truly doing the good thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3024">00:50:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, maybe a couple more questions and I'll cut it off at an hour and we'll do this again another time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3033">00:50:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Would you get drunk with Elon? How do you know it hasn't already happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3037">00:50:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A conversation with a historical figure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3041">00:50:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Emkata7 asks, "If Elon could talk to one person in the past for one hour, who would that person be? The same goes for you, Lex."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3050">00:50:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, by the way, I don't know how to do this live stream thing. And I'm sure Elon and folks like that would join live streams like these for a few minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3061">00:51:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to take up a long time. That's better for a long-form podcast. But it would be fun to have Elon roll in for like 5-10 minutes just to do some fun stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3071">00:51:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Elon, Joe Rogan, Tim Dillon even. I love that idea. Just roll in. Michael Malice, like literally he lives close to me. He could be under the table right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3083">00:51:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you wouldn't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3086">00:51:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I definitely want to do that in the future. I just have to figure out how to pull, how to bring in guests. I barely know what I'm doing with this live stream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3094">00:51:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, "If Elon could talk to one person in the past for one hour, who would that person be? The same goes for you, Lex."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3102">00:51:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he actually answered this similar question on a recent podcast he had. We talked about this also offline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3109">00:51:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for him it's Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, all those kinds of almost engineering people. I get it. I get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3124">00:52:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, in that vein, it would be Alan Turing probably. There's so little content from him, relatively speaking, that I would like to talk to Alan Turing for an hour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3137">00:52:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then again, an hour is not enough. It's got to be a weekend because we got to get drunk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3141">00:52:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Richard Feynman is a good example. Somebody I would really enjoy the hell out of that hour, but I wouldn't get new information. It would just be fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3148">00:52:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So is it about having fun or is it about getting new information?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3153">00:52:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Are you single?" Lex, yes, I am, unfortunately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3156">00:52:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nikola Tesla, no. I would err on the side of evil. That's going to be a clip taken out of context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3163">00:52:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would talk to somebody that... I would probably talk to Hitler. I would probably talk to Hitler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3175">00:52:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the problem is it's a German thing. If he somehow magically could speak English or Russian, because I don't speak German, so it would be lost in translation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3185">00:53:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then Stalin. Stalin in early... when Lenin was still alive. Maybe doing a room together with Lenin and Stalin to understand what is in the mind of the people that led to the suffering, the death of tens of millions and the suffering of hundreds of millions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3206">00:53:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is this? Because I feel like if I talk to them and take it back to the present time, the lessons will reverberate in a way that I'll be able to help prevent it in a way that I can't just by reading their works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3221">00:53:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like stuff from Einstein, all those kinds of things are captured within their written work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3226">00:53:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of these impactful leaders that caused suffering in the world, I think most of their evil is not put down on paper. Chairman Mao, yeah. Genghis Khan, sure. All those are interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3245">00:54:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Richard Feynman, Alan Turing. Richard Feynman, Alan Turing. Just because I can update them on the whole neural networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3253">00:54:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Richard Feynman, Alan Turing, and Einstein in a Tesla plaid with FSD autopilot flooring it. I want to see the look on Turing's face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3278">00:54:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of their faces. But Turing's face, this is neural networks. This is AI, motherfucker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3286">00:54:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He would be proud. Although he thought we're going to solve intelligence by year 2000. Anyway, he'd be kind of impressed by the whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3299">00:54:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Einstein would be disappointed. You know what? If Einstein's in the car, I'm also going to stop by in that Tesla plaid and pick up Eric Weinstein on the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3311">00:55:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to have those two have a conversation. I feel like they'd figure something out. Like, why haven't we come up with a theory of everything yet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3320">00:55:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And make it a podcast. This is getting way too exciting. Final question. Let's see. What should we make the final question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3335">00:55:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Would you talk to Jesus? Yes. Jesus. Let's say... Maybe one more question before the final question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3350">00:55:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I see a good final question. Non-final question. Second to last question. From Paulo Turao. Who would you want most to have on your podcast in 2022?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3368">00:56:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think the names like Putin, Elon, again, Barack Obama, Donald Trump. These are all people that fascinate me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3382">00:56:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would also love to talk to the chairman, the president of China. There's a lot of people I would like to talk to of that level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3392">00:56:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, Guguru Pearlman and so on. But I think who I want to be on the podcast, it takes it back to that person I talked to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3406">00:56:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was on Memorial Day. I had a conversation with a guy. He said he was a fan. He's wearing American flags everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3416">00:56:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "I'm a fan of the podcast. I listen to you. I listen to Joe. You guys talk to some of the most brilliant people, some of the funniest people, and just these celebrities and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3429">00:57:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't you ever talk to us regular folk?" That stuck with me. I'd like to talk to "regular folk." What Tim Dillon made fun of me for saying, "I think I'm a simple man."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3450">00:57:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to talk to other simple men and women because they're not that simple. They're not regular folk. They're not less special. They're as special.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3464">00:57:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They have a story, and I want to learn about those stories. That's what I want to do more in 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3471">00:57:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Final question from Andre. All right. We'll do this again. I'm really, really sorry. I don't know what the heck I'm doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3480">00:58:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had this idea real quick before I read the final question. I love Skyrim. I love video games in general. I don't get a chance to play them, but I love Skyrim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3490">00:58:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw somebody had this video where they just walk around Skyrim for a couple hours, just enjoying nature. I would love that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3503">00:58:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would just walk around, maybe answer some questions, but just the calmness of that. I feel that fits. That's a place where I could be happy in the digital space, is Skyrim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltt_L8KGXY&t=3516">00:58:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to take a little stroll in the woods.

You know who I'd really want to have on the podcast? This comes back.
