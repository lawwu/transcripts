I'm calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it personality-driven development, which is a kind of a cute name. And what we do at Perpetual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is we build AI agents. We call them virtual teammates or AI employees. And we have really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">leaned into the idea of giving them forms and form factors. So level set on terminology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">anthropomorphization, which I had to practice saying a whole lot. I like A18N, which I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know if it will catch on. That is when you give human traits to non-human entities, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yogi Bear or Lightning McQueen or Nemo, right? These are all anthropomorphized creatures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Fun fact, zoomorphization is when you do the same thing for animals. Not really relevant to this talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but I thought it was kind of cool. Aslan is a good example of this, right? Aslan's a lion from Narnia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a non-human entity or whatever, a non-animal entity that got animal characteristics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You can tell your boss on Monday this is what you learned at the conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are not new ideas, right? We've seen this in software for decades, right? Clippy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, her, I actually put this on the slide before, you know, the recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI fiasco. But anthropomorphizing, giving technology a human form, very, very common, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're seeing this obviously a lot more with agents, but again, not new ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So Mailchimp, you know, 20 years, they've had a monkey as the form of a human that like sends email for you, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, these are not new. But I would ask, right? So we have Siri, which is clearly not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">anthropomorphized, right? There's just no persona here. However, I'm going to make you raise your hands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">How many think Siri or you could do Alexa 2 is female? Anyone think it's male? Got one. Anyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think it's non-binary or think this is just a stupid question? Right? It's very weird, right? And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of a lot of like my learnings and my observations is that we're all people and we really like to ascribe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">human characteristics to things, right? So, well, suddenly this AI became female because it had a voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's strange, right? So, you know, GPT 4.0. Is this female? Male? What about when you're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to it? Suddenly it's like, oh, well, now it has a voice. And so suddenly it has a prescribed gender.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are just weird concepts, right? And they're normal, nothing profound here. But it's interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're thinking about product development and software development, what your customers or what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an audience is going to perceive on the other side. The foundational models, interestingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have really moved away from any of these concepts. And you can guess some of the reasons, some of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll talk about. But these are like the most modern representations of the foundational models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at least the ones that have consumer experiences, right? You have Copilot, you have OpenAI, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Meta AI, Gemini. This is how they're being represented, right? They clearly all share a single designer for some reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I want to go back to the female thing for a second. I'll keep it here. When we got a Google Home a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">couple years ago, right? The little screen you put in your kitchen that shows your photos. And I was super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">excited. And I was showing my wife. And I said, hey, look, we can set a timer and it can play music and all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">things. And she looked at me with just this, like, look in her eyes. She's like, you could not have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">woman in the kitchen that you boss around. She's like, and she was dead serious. She was like, that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">unacceptable. You can't just tell a woman what to do. And I was like, it's not a woman, right? And she's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I don't care. And she was very, very serious. And I was like, wow, this is remarkable how like deeply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ingrained the star. So I changed the voice to like an Australian man. And like, now we're cool. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like, everyone's happy. But like, true story, right? So I think it's also helpful to think about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">contrapositive, the opposite. Like, what is it like an AI that's like, doesn't have a form, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this is just a great example, right? The AI that's inside Google Photos is just mind blowing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Just like search for a dog, all the pictures of my beagle, like, lovely. But there's no form here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't think about Google Photos as having like, personality, right? It just, it just is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the algorithm is like under the covers. Oh, another fun fact, as long as I'm talking to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">family. So I showed this to my 11 year old Zeke. And he was like, oh, my God, Google Photos has ChatGPT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">inside. So if you wonder how, you know, Gemini's branding is going with the youth, it is not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">not good at all. So at Perpetual, we've really leaned into this idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">giving agents forms and personalities. And we really took it a couple steps. And we tell our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">customers, you can give your agents their own forms. And so here's tech lead, right? Kind of a cyborg</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Android type of, you know, persona. And, you know, a member of the team writes code, does code reviews,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that. But really leaned in to say, listen, they can have a personality, they can have a form</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">factor, they can have preferences. And then things get real weird because our recruiter is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">an artichoke. And it's like, oh, it's kind of like technology that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">zoom morphized into a, or whatever you do with a vegetable that now has human characteristics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's all very bizarre. But on the other hand, it's like, oh, it actually kind of makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You're like, I mean, it makes no sense. But it's also like, I understand this, like, it's a recruiter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">who has this form. And we have teams of agents. And these are hamsters. And they run the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have the general manager and the graphic designer. And they represent their own roles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And on one hand, it's very amusing. So the question would be like, why are we doing this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, well, I'll get to why we're doing it in a second. Let me talk about the expectations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because this was surprising. So customer expectations, as soon as you put a form onto something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, get real. And they get real very quickly. So assumption number one is that you can chat with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And there's nothing about workflow. At the end of the day, like our agents, all we're talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is workflow. If we're being real, right? It's just like, it's just smart workflow. That's what we're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">doing. There's no reason that you should be able to chat with it. But all of a sudden, oh, it has a face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I must be able to chat with it. Oh, do I talk with it in Slack or in Teams? Like, wait, why do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that should even be a thing? But like, 100% it is. Personality. Everyone assumes it's going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a personality, right? And generally, the baseline is like, you're a helpful assistant, right? So assume,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, you're going to be friendly, a helpful assistant. And we've very, very quickly adopted that mental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">model. By we, I mean, customers like have adopted this mental model of just like, oh, a helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">assistant. That's great. You know, we let customers make, you know, make them snarky, make them funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, at the end of the day, there's an assumption. And again, that was also weird. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">why does software have personality?

It gets wrong. But like, all of software fails all the time, right? But you never hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people being like, fuck you, Google Sheets, right?

You better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">believe it, right? It's just like, it's weird. You suddenly have this thing that you can get mad at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, you can -- this is all just psychology. It's user psychology that is really, really innate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And thinking about this from the perspective of product development, of, you know, software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">development, it's like, well, is there any reason that we actually do it? Like, it seems like there's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like -- I mean, I already named some downsides actually listed a lot more at the end.

And we found that to just be an incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful -- what's the word? Like a jargon. Not even jargon. It's just like the terse way to describe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that we're all doing without getting into really complicated discussions about React</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">frameworks, right?

I think most people think of, like -- I should just talk about AI for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They call it, like, the algorithm, right? People, like, know the word algorithm. And everyone thinks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">an algorithm is just, like, why my news feed is not in order, right?

It's just this concept that is just very hard to grasp, very hard to grok. But giving something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a name, or a name that's something that we are familiar with, really, really powerful, because now you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about it. And I was really struck by, I don't know, for the Android folks, Google Now used to -- all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the phones are going to buzz -- or, I guess, all the phones that haven't been updated in three years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to buzz -- Google Now was essentially what Google Assistant became. And it did all the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. It set your timers and your reminders. And you would talk to Google Now. But, like, what was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it? It was, like -- it was just, like, this weird conceptual thing. But all of a sudden, it became a Google</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Assistant. And you're, like, oh, again, it's a thing that, like, works on my behalf. And it, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you have this, like, almost corporeal understanding of, like, what it is. And I'd actually be curious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if Gemini makes this better or worse. But, again, Google Now and the same thing. But just that one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">nuance difference made it really easy to understand. Price anchoring. So this is an interesting one. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know that this is, like, well-tested in the field yet. All of this is so new. But if what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about, again, is just, like, workflow and all of our agents are just doing, like, workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what is the mindset for what workflow should cost, right? We look at comps and it's, like, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">know, 50 bucks a month. I mean, it's sort of, like, there's, again, making up the numbers. But if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">think about it as a percentage -- or if your price anchored on a junior employee, wow, it changes the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation, right? So you talk to an executive and it's, like, yeah, 1/20th of the cost, 1/100th of the cost,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Suddenly it changes that nature of that pricing conversation. Again, I don't know that this is fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">battle-tested or if it will withstand tests of time, right? But, like, right now, it's fantastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that a ferret? What is that? An otter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's an awesome picture. So the other reason that this is a really helpful construct is it is a way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">decompose problems, right? So thinking about if, you know, wearing an engineering hat for a moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right? What is engineering? It is abstractions about the real world. It is getting the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">levels of abstractions and it's about decomposing problems. Like, that's just all we do all day long,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And in a sense, this is, like, an arbitrary way to break down a problem. On the other hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a really useful way to break down a problem, which is what we've learned, right? So specialized agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have heard a bunch of talks today talk about specialized agents versus generalized and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">specialized ones perform better, right? It's like, oh, we have a finite set of tools. We have a small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">number of inputs. Like, there's just less chance for LMs who are trying to interpret or do tool calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to get things wrong. And so it just happens to be a really convenient way to break down problems and also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to scale because we can keep subdividing, like, agent problems into more and more specializations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's just very natural. Again, arbitrary, but, like, even for me, just like, oh, this is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">helpful. I understand that my AI engineer writes code and I understand that my AI copywriter, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">writes compelling copy and, like, great. I can get my head around that very, very easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless it's just fun, right? Which is, you know, that's sort of a company branding question, but, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we like making our video game avatars, right? You spend more time making your, like, eyebrows correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in, like, the Nintendo Switch than you do playing the game. We roll characters in D&D. Like, so, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">why not have fun, right? So that's sort of a personal perspective on this. Let's talk about the downsides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's not going to be any cute pictures because, you know, this is, like, a sad part. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, so one of the big glaring ones is, like, we are just inviting inclusivity and stereotype</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">challenges, right? We were just asking for it. One thing that was fascinating is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all those avatars were generated, right? So a customer can pick their form and we ought to generate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">100% of the software engineers are generated with, like, neckties, like, looking like men. They're just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what comes right out of Dolly. And, like, I'm not going to have any, like, perspectives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but, like, it's just, like, all of them do. So we are just inviting this onto ourselves. And is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">worth it, right? Is that worth it in a work context to really just invite those questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Expectations of performance. I don't know what it is because we assume, like, software is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">always just work. But there's this expectation that, like, these agents are going to perform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">really, really well, right?

It's just what we've seen. It's like, yes, of course it's going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it right 100% of the time. The features I alluded to before, it's like, why are we spending our time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">building, like, chat interfaces and all of these things that, like -- it's just -- it's strange. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you almost have to if you're building this type of personified agent.

But I'm going to guess that when we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">walk this back and rebrand, like, holy shit, right?

This is a major, you know, stake in the ground that we would be planting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, it could be a distraction, right? Like, all of these fun stuff that we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">about around personalities and, like, chatting and preferences -- it's a distraction from the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">business value, which is, like, document review and data extraction. The thing that, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">someone would pay for, it can be distracting. But at the end of the day, honestly, the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">downside right now is that it is just a very stark reminder that you're replacing jobs. And, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the -- outside the scope of the talk, whether or not that is a good thing or a bad thing or an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">inevitable thing, right? However, it is a reality that as soon as you bring this up with a prospect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, first thing on their mind. And I'll just be real. I'll tell a story. So, very recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I was, you know, pitching sort of, you know, C-suite pitch, right, to a CEO. It was like, oh, this is -- you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">can't scale your business. You don't have enough people. You could never hire enough people to scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the business to meet your aspirations. Have we got a solution for you? It's also shit work. Like, no one wants to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do it. Like, it's great. And he was just loving. He's like, yeah, this is, like, exactly what I need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the cost, it'll be great. And so, set up our first design session. And we get into the meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And he has, you know, one of his, you know, like an IC on the team.

I'm, like, an executive, right? I brought the person who knows what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Ben. And he has software that has virtual employees. Can you please tell him what your job is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, my jaw dropped. I was like, oh, shit. Like, I was not at all prepared for that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Just like, oh, I can't talk to you with a straight -- like, whether or not I'm going to actually make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you more productive and you will do better in your -- like, just to lead with that in the conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was just, like, really, really hard. So, it's, like, very, very quick, like, on the fly, try to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">walk back that concept of, like, oh, no, no, no. Like, this is actually going to help you. And, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whether -- we don't know what the future is going to hold. But, like, we are definitely, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">leaning heavily into this, and it's potentially a huge hurdle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Got a couple more minutes. I want to talk about, you know, so this was the title,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Personality-Driven Design. And there's this -- I don't actually even have, like, the words for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be curious afterwards if folks do. The software we're building and our ability to, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">create these roles, these virtual employees that have job descriptions and forms and personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">preferences and, like, there's no, like, checkboxes inside, like, the configuration. It's all very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt-driven, right? But it's a way to inject nuance and business logic into these agents with zero</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">configuration, which means that every single instance is, like, 100 percent -- excuse me -- bespoke for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">each customer, which is a really wild concept. When you think about, like, oh, can I reproduce this bug?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it work on my machine? It's like, well, of course not. Like, of course this doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's -- every single instance is bespoke, right? So here's just, like -- I mean, this is not a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">one. This is an example, right? A giraffe, right, who has a personality. It's charismatic. It's entertaining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You review resumes. You read cover letters. You know, you do that, like, operational work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's where it gets super interesting is the preferences, right? Oh, as a hiring manager,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to tell my recruiter my priorities, and I like people who went to Ivy League schools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't like job hopper -- I sound like such an old man -- and I don't like people who hop jobs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and, like, I like cover letters.

And so this is just an amazing concept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that, like, again, I really don't have my head around, like, what it means for, like, the future of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">software when an entire thing can be molded to meet the business's need, not just, like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what the PM of the SaaS platform, like, happened to, like, think was a good checkbox, right? And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this is sort of, like, the future that I'm really, really excited to be working on. Period. Full stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_8rgQqxfc&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.
