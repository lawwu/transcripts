href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to say first that a church that's about to tackle this and either baptize or not baptize a person with cognitive impairment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">needs to teach widely on baptism, faith, disability, so you don't spring this on your congregation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It shouldn't come out of nowhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a golden opportunity for a pastor to bring the sorrows and the joys of these families before the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and put the whole question in the bigger context of God's sovereignty and His goodness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and His ability to take the hardest situations and show His all-sufficiency in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the first thing I'd say is put this issue in the bigger context of disability and God's sovereign goodness in your church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second thing I'd say is deal with believers' baptism before you try to deal with a marginal issue in believers' baptism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We believe, we Baptists believe, that before Jesus inaugurated the new covenant, in His blood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the people of God were identified through a physical line of Jewishness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and therefore it was fitting that the sign belonging to this people, the sign of the covenant belonging to this people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was given to their physical children, the Jews, and that sign was circumcision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But with the new covenant, God's saving focus is no longer on any ethnic group,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but is defined most essentially by identification with Jesus the Christ through faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And thus the new sign of this new covenant is no longer circumcision but baptism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and no longer given to physical descendants but to spiritual descendants, that is, to those who have faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the fundamental picture of believers' baptism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here are two texts. This is not an APJ about baptism mainly, but about what about these kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But here are two texts for people to think about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">1 Peter 3.21, "Baptism, which corresponds to this, the flood, now saves you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sounds kind of dangerous. Sounds like baptism or regeneration, but listen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"saves you not as a removal of dirt from the body," so I'm not talking about saving you by the effectiveness of the water,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"but as an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So baptism is pictured here as an event in which the baptismal candidate is making an appeal to God for a good conscience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">through submitting to this water baptism symbolic of his death and resurrection with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's a conscious act of the candidate, and hence we don't do it to children who can't make that—</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">little infants who can't make that appeal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or here's one other text, Colossians 2.12, "Having been buried therefore with him in baptism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in which you were also raised with him through faith."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was so big for me when I was in Germany trying to battle with these Lutherans in all my classes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was the only Baptist in the group, and this text was hugely important for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Having been buried therefore with him in baptism, in which," in baptism, "you were raised with him through faith."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I say it was through faith that we were raised with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are two texts that point me to believers' baptism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, which leaves us asking, what about those with severe cognitive impairment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Both the inability to, say, grasp ideas at the front end and the ability to express them at the back end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the first thing we should do is make clear that if a family moves forward with baptism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not because these young people belong to a Christian family, either by birth or adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That would signify a wrong theology, namely, connectedness by flesh is spiritually saving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're saying, "Well, the reason this baby should be—I mean, this child should be baptized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this 18-year-old should be baptized is because he's in my family and I'm a Christian," that's a bad theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not saved by belonging to families.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing to make clear is that we don't believe that someone who, for reasons beyond their control, is not baptized would therefore be lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The thief on the cross was not baptized, and Jesus said, "Today you'll be with me in paradise," because there was an extenuating circumstance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we shouldn't communicate that we've got to get this person baptized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because if they're not baptized, they may not go to heaven. That would be a wrong view of why we might want to move with these young people towards baptism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbTtk0OIWI&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's my counsel—very practical.
