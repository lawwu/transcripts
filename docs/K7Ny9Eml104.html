That's some really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3707" target="_blank">01:01:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. There's a famous story about this Explorer named Hernando Cortez, where, you know, we've all heard this analogy, or this, this, this little phrase before, where, you know, when they were exploring, coming from Europe, and you know, they hit the Caribbean islands, and then, you know, looking for America, etc. The famous phrase is burn the boats. Yep. Right. Can't go back, we have to find our way make it work. The, the way that that's been extended in business is sort of what we would call scorched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The earth. And there's a competitive move that a lot of businesses if they're smart enough can execute, which is to effectively take a key market and take an economic view of that market, where you say that we're going to take all the economic value away from it. And I think this is a first step towards a really interesting play that Microsoft could pull, which is essentially to scorch the earth of app stores, which is Google's and Apple's really big money printer to make a completely open permissible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's a really interesting move, because if you look at the market, it's a completely open platform, with very little to no take rate. And in a market as big as video games, I think what it does is it creates pressure on all these other mega platforms to essentially copy them. And I think Friedberg mentioned this before Google has actually been the best in doing this by finding these key markets, or I think it was sacks, you know, Chrome and other things and giving them away for free. Google is in a position to make the app store effectively free. And then that puts Apple on a little bit of a desert island. So Jason, back to why I think you can keep Apple free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple in that basket of shorts, the competitive pressures are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3800" target="_blank">01:03:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">mounting by by the moves of Microsoft that I think are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3803" target="_blank">01:03:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">easier for Google to copy, and very difficult for companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3806" target="_blank">01:03:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like Apple to copy because it creates an incredible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3808" target="_blank">01:03:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">disincentive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Ny9Eml104&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Mark Leary: Yeah.
