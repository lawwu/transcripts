something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx_b-MtCrDQ&t=197">00:03:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in between?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx_b-MtCrDQ&t=198">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then let's get into Twitter's insane decision to block the URL.</span></div><div

and Facebook overreacted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx_b-MtCrDQ&t=225">00:03:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that the story

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx_b-MtCrDQ&t=235">00:03:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they intervened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx_b-MtCrDQ&t=235">00:03:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I think there's going to be a third mistake, which is that conservatives are
