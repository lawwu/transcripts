Does it feel like another technology, like metaverse or social, or does it feel like a fundamentally different thing in the course of human history? I think it's going to be pretty fundamental. I think it's going to be more like the creation of computing in the first place, right?</p><p>So you'll get all these new apps in the same way that when you got the web or you got mobile phones, you got people basically rethought all these experiences and a lot of things that weren't possible before now became possible. So I think that will happen, but I think it's a much lower level innovation.</p><p>It's going to be more like going from people didn't have computers to people have computers. The cosmic scale, obviously, it'll happen quickly over a couple of decades or something. But I do think that there is some set of people who are afraid of like, it really just kind of spins and goes from being like somewhat intelligent to extremely intelligent overnight.</p><p>And I just think that there's all these physical constraints that make that, so that that's unlikely to happen. I just don't really see that playing out. So I think you'll have, I think we'll have time to kind of acclimate a bit, but it will really change the way that we work and give people all these creative tools to do different things that they, yeah, I think it's going to be, it's going to really enable people to do the things that they want a lot more is my view.</p><p>Is it your view that like on a cosmic scale, if you think like humans evolved and then like AI happened and then they like went out through the galaxy or maybe it takes many decades, maybe it takes a century, but like, is that like the grand scheme of what's happening right now in history?</p><p>I think that's tricky. I think people like to, I mean, the history of humanity, I think has been people basically, you know, thinking that certain aspects of humanity are like really unique in different ways and then coming to grips with the fact that that's not true, but humanity is actually still super special, right?</p><p>So it's, it's like, we thought that the earth was the center of the universe and it's like, it's not, but like, it's like humans are still pretty awesome, right? And pretty unique. I think that another bias that people tend to have is thinking that intelligence is somehow kind of fundamentally connected to life.</p><p>And it's not actually clear that it is. I mean, I don't know that we have a clear enough definition of consciousness or life to kind of fully interrogate this, but I know there's all this science fiction about, okay, you create intelligence and now it like starts taking on all these human like behaviors and things like that.</p><p>But I actually think that the current incarnation of all this stuff, at least kind of feels like it's going in a direction where intelligence can be pretty separated from consciousness and agency and things like that, that I think just makes it a super valuable tool. So I don't know.</p><p>I mean, obviously it's very difficult to predict what direction this stuff goes in over time, which is why I don't think anyone should be dogmatic about how they plan to develop it or what they plan to do. I think you want to kind of look at like each release.</p><p>I think you want to kind of look at like each release. I think you want to kind of look at like each release. I think you want to kind of look at like each release. I think you want to kind of look at like each release. I think you want to kind of look at like each release.</p></div></div></body></html>
