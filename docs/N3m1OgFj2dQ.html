For example, like, I was, you know, I think yesterday you, we had gone over the Zilde symbol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but like it technically looks like a data symbol. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, not quite it's got a squiggle it's a squiggly theta. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like, I guess, but I'm just generally wondering where did these names come from. Like, it's so it's kind of completely like unlike what it should be called like if you're looking at the Greek letters or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm kind of confused from that. Well, okay so I mean this is not the Greek letters, it's not wrong. The ones that are Greek letters are correct. So alpha is called alpha, iota is called iota, and omega is called omega.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There, there is a thought that even those shouldn't be there because like, they give preferential treatment to people of kind of European backgrounds who might recognize Greek letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, but generally, so they were all created by Ken Iverson and his wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think like his wife let drew them or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're designed to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're designed to be demonic. Right. So for example equals as the equals we recognize, and it means that one, two, three equals two, two, three will do a element wise equality return a Boolean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like this one here is like extremely much. Sorry, I always forget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so 123 equals 223 gives 001 because it's element wise equals and yeah so it's just showing you on the order here that it's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not a tilde.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This one here, I kind of think of as like extremely equal to because it checks whether two things are exactly the same items and exactly the same shape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it checks whether.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can see, so exactly so that example one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I should change. I got the wrong symbol here. So is it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. Okay, so these are equal and.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, one equals is extremely equal to is false because they're different lengths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas is normal equals two is like broadcasted element wise. So this is kind of like mnemonics you know and then obviously this is that like not version of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then some of them are kind of like borrowed from other areas. A lot of them destroy a drawings of things this is the thing on the left hand side of a function this is on the right hand side of a function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the biggest thing and the littlest thing. So yeah, they made them up, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then somebody I think in the chat was him says Zelda is a portmanteau of zero tilde, which is exactly what it is. It's a zero with a total through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, were they, I guess when these were created because like these are all Unicode characters right so they are now when they are now okay so before they were not really part of the code and.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things that really helped a lot was there are these things called golf ball typewriters I don't know if you've ever seen them, but they're just, they're like normal typewriters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But instead of like lots of little different things that bang there's a single thing that spins around and goes up and down to bang, and there was a APL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of those that was created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And apparently that helped a lot because then people could like easily typeset things but until that time my understanding is that Ken and his wife, I can't quite remember her name Jeanette or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, they basically would like draw them and then stick them in the right place and, you know, typeset in that rather old fashioned way so yeah must have been a lot of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most math was probably done that way anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, they ended up becoming part of Unicode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, fonts. Most fonts don't have all Unicode characters in. And so if you're wondering why it is you can look at like a web page or something with APL characters, even if you don't have an APL font installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your operating system behind the scenes tries to find any font that contains a character that's that's needed and will generally show it to you using that font, if it, if it can, and it only falls back to the kind of like question mark or box if it can't find it at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a really actually a really great font. It's kind of like my favorite coding font in some ways anyway, which is Jessica and Jessica extended contains all of APL in quite a nice way and pretty much everything else, and it's a really nice font.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're ever wondering what font to use for your terminal picking this one is not a bad choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I created so many characters and variants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Quite amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that font.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will think a lot about everything, mainly from Twitter, and then some things from like Hacker News, and some things from like following links from one of those places finding things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right so we've got a kind of running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think there's probably anything to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use that might have just been G H pages have all or anybody do you know if there's a way to like, ignore a branch like, I never need G H pages locally right this or.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's going to update a lot more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he really want to pull master.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought we could do like some Boolean stuff today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If that sounds right for everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are all pretty straightforward I think, unless some of the monadic ones are weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Looks like equals doesn't have a monadic version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Dialogue language elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, if anybody's interested.

So in the source, this just said backtick numpy dot array, and it's automatically been hyperlinked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way that's done is we use linkify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that splits the lines up, it goes to each line, checks whether or not we're in a fenced area or not. And then once we find the right lines, we create links in them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is done using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1OgFj2dQ&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this class.
