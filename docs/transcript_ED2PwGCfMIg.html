Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me. For my soul takes refuge in you, and in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge until destruction passes by. I will call to God most high, to God who accomplishes all things for me. He will send from heaven and save me.</p><p>He who approaches him who tramples upon me. God will send his loving kindness and his truth. My soul is among lions, I'm lying down among those who breathe forth fire. Sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue is sharp sword. Be exalted above the heavens, O God, let your glory be above all the earth.</p><p>They have set a net for my steps, my souls bow down, they dug a pit before me. They themselves have fallen into the midst of it. My heart is set, O God, my heart is set. I'll sing, yes, I'll sing praises. Awake, my glory, awake, harp and lyre, I will awaken the dawn.</p><p>I'll give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples. I'll sing praises to you among the nations, for your loving kindness is great to the heavens and your truth to the skies. Be exalted above the heavens, O Lord, let your glory be above all the earth. Psalm 57. (gentle music) you you</p></div></div></body></html>
