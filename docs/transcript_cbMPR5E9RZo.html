So we heard so many stories. One of the things about Iceland is that you're gonna spend some time driving. And I think a mistake you could make on a trip is to base yourself solely in Reykjavik because then you're not only gonna have to drive everywhere, we had to drive everywhere, but you're gonna have to drive everywhere every day.</p><p>And so really getting out and staying in different parts of the country, I think gives you a lot more access. It means you don't have to drive three and a half hours to start your day every day. But on those drives, there were so many amazing stories. I don't even know how I could recap them, but it was funny how a recurring theme seemed to be that in almost every Icelandic story, everyone dies.</p><p>We thought this was really just like from the sagas, the Vikings and all these old stories, but even with like children's stories, death is not something that it seems like in Icelandic culture. Maybe it's scary, but it's not not talked about.</p></div></div></body></html>
