The Fed raised 25 basis points. The market obviously has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ripped since then the jobs data this morning was crazy.

The Fed I think is starting to realize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they can obviously impact inflation and slow down speculative assets, but they're having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a very hard time with the labor market.

We've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about that many times here.

And it was really amazing because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in December, he was extremely hawkish.

And that was pretty clear and the markets reacted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then not but 3540 days later, he essentially said we have to 25 basis point hikes left to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's going to try to stick the landing essentially. And even though the rest of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">language in his entire speech, and the press conference, if you read it in the absence of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">his body language, so if you just read the transcript would seem very hawkish as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reality was he basically capitulated and then the market essentially said, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we're at the end of this thing. And we've talked about this before, but markets tend to bottom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">six to nine months before it's clear that you could have done this. And so we're a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">off to the races in the short term. It's compounded by a couple of other factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">One is that at the end of last year, so many people were tax loss harvesting, which means if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you had some gain somewhere else, you sold some things that were losing money so that you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">net the two together. You saw a lot of stocks Tesla was probably the poster child for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">trade all the way down to like $108 a share, and it's effectively doubled in the last 30 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So everybody tax loss harvested, everybody degrossed, nobody was really owning anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when Powell basically said we're mostly done, there's been so much systematic buying right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">now that nobody's really well positioned. To me, this is very similar and eerily reminiscent of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. And if you guys remember, at the end of 2018, October,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">November, December, the markets just fell. And part of it was Powell's going to raise rates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">inflation is getting out of control, etc, etc. And then we got all this data that said China</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">may be entering a real period of malaise. And Powell capitulated, again, trying to stick the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">landing. And long story short, he didn't. That was a head fake, and the markets just ripped higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we went into the COVID pandemic and all that stuff happened. So I think we're about to replay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit of that at least in the next 30 to 90 days. The pain trade is to go up. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">probably where we're going.

Do you think they cut? And what overall effect is this going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to have on venture capital in the startup market, which is super important to us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're in the whipsaw economy here. Just a month ago, sentiment was incredibly negative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">On the show, we were predicting for the year that we were looking at the Fed funds rate going from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">four and a half percent to say five and a half percent, 250 point increases. The belief was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we were going to have a recession later this year. I think that was pretty much consensus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And now three weeks later, you had a situation in which we got a couple of really good inflation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reports. So all of a sudden the consensus changed to, we're not going to need to raise rates to five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and a half percent. Maybe we only get one or two more quarter point rates. And the market just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ripped on the belief that inflation was in the rear view mirror. The problem had been licked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we can just kind of move forward. And the Fed seemed to confirm that just yesterday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">with a quarter point rate increase. And now today we have this wild jobs report with over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">half a million new jobs.

And one way to look at this is as a prediction market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of where the market thinks interest rates are going, because the Fed sets the rate for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Fed's funds rate, which is the overnight rate of lending to banks, but they do not set the rate of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, three months, six months, bonds, 10 year bonds, and so on. The market does because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the market trades those bonds, and it imputes a yield that the market requires to want to hold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">those bonds. So what's interesting is that if you view the yield curve as a, again, as a prediction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">market, it tells you at any given time, what the collective wisdom is of the market. Now, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">thing is fluctuating, moving all the time. So that collective wisdom is changing. But where things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">today, it's pretty interesting. It looks like what the market is saying is that within the next six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">months, the rate peaks at 4.75%. So Nick, if you just want to hold the mouse on the six month dot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see it's 4.76%. So basically, the market is predicting we get maybe one more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">quarter point, roughly, not much. And then if you go to the two year, it's at 4.09%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so a little over 4%. So what the market is actually predicting is that over the next two years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we're actually going to get a 50 basis point decrease from the Fed. And then if you go to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">say, the five year or the 10 year, we're at 3.5%. So the market is basically saying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">long term rates are going to stabilize at 3.5%.

Right. So when you look at when rates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">were sort of approaching zero or were zero, there was a lot of really successful companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they're listed here in the in the light gray on the right.

So there is this counter narrative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which may be that the game the game goes on, the band continues to march on the current crop dies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">out.
