Now, if he was just my peer, he'd say, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I did the same thing and I'm going to do the same thing. That would be like hanging out with somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of your ilk, but you don't, you want somebody who's above that.

He goes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I bought a Steadicam, but not to operate it. I'm going to take it apart and design a better one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Us mere mortals trying to learn how to operate the camera.

We put so much of the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">around them. Like when you see the city, we put like a blue screen way in the back to just make the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">city keep going. But we built the sets there, the town, we built the real set. So everything was very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">tangible and real. And that way she had to fit into that world and be as real as that. Because if it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">all done in CG, well, then now you can fudge everything. But if you put her in a real environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a real challenge. And just like with our movies, you watch it all fall apart. You watch this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">thing blow up.

Everything just falls apart in front of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">face. Then that's when you roll up your sleeves and creatively figure out a way around it. And by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the end, you have a result that's better than what you sought out. Sift through the ashes of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">failure and you'll find the key to your next success is in there. But if you're not looking for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't find it.

That's right. That is the meme. Because it was an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">accident, it was just supposed to be, it was just two grenades, not a nuclear bomb.

I remember showing it Jim Cameron</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">before it came out, and his hand went up, like, you've never seen that before, you know.

So those movies came out within six months of each other. That's why it turned into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, because people saw it.

Okay, that one, it's like, okay, you're going to walk out, and it's all in one take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're only going to do one take.

We're going to start with just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, some smaller explosions, and then when they're further away, and it's safer, then we'll do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the big fireballs. So we're going, and you're nervous, because like, if one of them trips up a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">line, and you know, the pressure's on them, it's not just you that's nervous. You're nervous for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They're the ones who got to walk out, do that whole speech, get in the car, and drive away. What if the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">car doesn't start? What do you know? There's a lot of things that could happen. Well, guess what happens?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing you would not expect, they go in, they come out, they start talking, shoot it. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect. Great. We can move on. And the camera guy goes, I don't know what happened, but just like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you had a little snafu here, he goes, we have an autofocus on the steadicam. I mean, we have a focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. It just went like this. I felt it go whack all the way out of focus, and whack for a second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">back. Like, it just reset itself. I don't know why it did that, you know, because it's radio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">controlled. And we can't tell because we're shooting film, you know, sort of like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">shit, let's watch the dailies, sure enough. Let's see if we can get, maybe I can scratch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the film right there.

So we had to wait till we're back in that location. We rigged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it for two more takes, just in case. So that thing that was supposed to be the one take is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">three takes. The other thing that happened was the front of the Dust Till Dawn bar was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that same guy that did those explosions. He packed a bunch of explosives behind the actors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">When the actors come running out of the, of the bar at the end of the movie, and there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">an explosion through the door because all the vampires are blowing up. He didn't just, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">put like 10 times. So it blew out. You see it in the movie. You see this huge fireball</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">going up. And if you watch closely, you see it already start to catch the whole place on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">fire. The whole front of that, which is foam catching on fire. And I cut just before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">see that it's on fire. And we, that was the first shot at that bar. Cause we weren't going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to start shooting the other stuff till night. So the first shot is that, and the sets ruined</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">burned or crisp. The neon lights blew up. So we couldn't even shoot. Cheech goes, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess I'm not doing my speech tonight. And, but right away, this is what, this is what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">My first AD, Doug Arnachowski comes over to me and I go over to him.

It was like, the thing was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">scorching.

I said, let's just keep shooting. Let's just keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">shooting because it looks really kind of cool like this. Yeah. They're going to have to come repair</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it and we'll have to come back, but it's all black and charred. That's why that whole scene with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">George Clooney and Cheech and that the building's black. We didn't go over there and touch that up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That's real flame that burned and it ended up looking great. So then the next week when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we came back to shoot that other shot that didn't work, we came back and they had repaired it and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">shot all the night stuff, which is the majority of the stuff in front of it. So sometimes you got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">roll with it and then, and look, look at the blessing you get because of this mistake. You probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually got a better take by doing it later with them. And then you had this incredible look for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">end of the movie that looked apocalyptic. If it had looked just clean, you would have actually seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that it was kind of a foam set. This made it look better. So I kind of let the universe push you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're supposed to go. Just roll with it. You got to roll with it because you don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the grand plan is.

You come up with your plan of what you want to accomplish. That's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">your script. Then you go scout your location and figure out what your project's going to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and you go try to make it as bulletproof as possible. Then you go to do your project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And just like with our movies, you watch it all fall apart. You watch this thing blow up. You watch this thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">not work.

Then that's when you roll up your sleeves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and creatively figure out a way around it. You turn chicken shit into chicken salad. And by the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a result that's better than what you sought out.

The rest of your life, that's what everything's going to be like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like a movie. Because when you think about it, you're writing a story for a film.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're also writing the story of your life at the same time. Like how are you going to react to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">things?

Why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">don't you just make yourself that way?

What lessons do I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">take from it?

We'll talk about it. Let's go to the beginning. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a few technical things that are fascinating about your beginning. So you started making films when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">very young with an old super eight camera and you were editing on a VCR. You see, I've met a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">filmmakers who, you know, they start a certain way, but then they finish another way. They get to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">big filmmakers and all that. I still do it that way. Like I still, I like doing things that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a new company called brass knuckle films where the audience can actually participate by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">investing in this movie and investors in these movies that are done the same way. They're action films</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like we did with Mariachi, but 10 to 30 million. It doesn't take a lot of money to start a billion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">dollar franchise. You know, like John Wick only cost 20 million. The first one, second one was 40.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Third one was 80.

We should mention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">an action film. Yeah, that's right. But also we should say that El Mariachi, the, the, the film on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which the book rebel without a crew is $7,000 movie. So let's put it all in context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know, you know, you're going to hire bigger actors. You can get a big actor, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Tiana Reeves for a $20 million movie. You know, I asked Jim, I said, Jim Cameron, I said, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like Terminator costs 5 million.

He had less than 5 million for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So you can start a billion dollar franchise using these methods. And, uh, and with the audience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">investing, they get to make money on them. And this is what I'm going to say now about how I started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You see that DNA of how I give out, you know, I want people to know how I did things with rebel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">without a crew or with these methods that I started with. You see, that's how we kept going. Hollywood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">spends way too much. And when you can make stuff for less, your profit margin is much better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I first started, I didn't have any money. So I still play like I don't have money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had super eight, my dad had a super eight camera, but I couldn't afford it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I shot two rolls that you had to get to, you had to buy the film, shoot two minutes. I shot two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">rolls of that. It's another same amount of money that it costs to buy it, whatever that was, 12 bucks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever to develop it. You get it. There's no sound. Most of the shit's out of focus, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but then my dad who sold cookware had a VCR, one of the first VCRs, home VCRs for the market that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">would play his sales tapes to his salesman. And it came with a camera attached like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">cable you got coming out. Imagine if that had to go into your VCR for you to even see what it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">shooting. And this is old camera, manual focus, manual iris and 12 foot cable. And I would start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">making movies with that instead. Now I have for $8, I have a two hour erasable tape of sound and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">picture. So I got into digital basically really early. I was doing, which was really frowned upon back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then and continued to be all the way to when I was using it for real in the early 2000s before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone realized, oh, that's the future. Yeah. That's fascinating. Cause you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">rebel in that way too, using digital. Yeah. Well, cause of the means and the democratizing of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the elite didn't like that. You could just go make a movie like that, but I started practicing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's much easier to practice when it doesn't cost any money. Like if you want to be a rock star,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? If you want to learn how to play guitar really well, you're not going to just jump on stage and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">suddenly go to play. You have to practice to your fingers bleed. Well, the same with movies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you got to keep telling stories and cutting them together. And you just can't afford that on film.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody can with two minute roll costing as much as a two hour tape. So I was moving all these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">doing all these movies. First, I would cut in camera and that VCR, that old VCR had a really great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">pause button that they stopped making that when you hit pause, it stopped right there. And it stopped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with a clean cut. It didn't have all this color bars like the later ones had. So I, that was my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and it had an audio dub feature where you could add another second soundtrack to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I have people talking, I could hit audio dub and add sound effects. So I could have two tracks on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the same one. So I, that was my filmmaking kit for a while until I needed to start doing real editing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And my dad bought a second VCR for his business. Cause I stole his other one and I found that if I hooked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">them together, I could play on one and use that pause button on the second.

Cause sometimes you shoot out of order. So when I cut it, I have to cut</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">in linear order because if you push pause, it's a nice clean cut, but only, it only holds for five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes.

Like I wanted to make these action movies in my backyard, but when you're a teenager, you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">know anybody who can come be your action star. And if you just bring your high school buddies, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they just look like high school kids. So I use my little brothers and sisters cause I'm one of 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">third oldest.

So bedhead was my first time using a film camera. It was a windup film camera. I got in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">film school. I went to film school for one semester and realized I already knew more than the film</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">students. Cause they, they taught you a whole other outdated way of doing it. So I thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to use that film camera camera to make a, a low budget movie, a definitive film</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">version that I can send to all film festivals of these action kids, which is a precursor to spy kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Bedhead is a precursor to spy kids.

So I made that little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">short film, sent it and it was winning all the festivals. And I thought, wow, I made that with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">wind up camera, film camera filming, just one take each shot, just no slates. Cause I'm the editor and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that cost 800 bucks. And it was eight minutes. I bet I can make an 80 minute movie for $8,000 if I'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use the same method. So that movie I did six months later, I was making mariachi because it opened up my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">mind to that. I could try it in a feature. Can we actually pause on that? Because I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">a bad head has a really great, really unique story shot in a really unique way. I think what I'm trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to say is like, it's very important to write, write the right script, write the right story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me tell you the trick to that. And mariachi is the same way. And this really helped people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like even Kevin Smith from clerk said, wow, Robert said when mariachi was success, I talked about how I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">did it. And I said, I, I, I looked at everything I had. What do I have? We have a pit bull. We have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">turtle. We've got a bus that Carlos's cousin owns. His cousin is a brother has a brother-in-law has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bar and he owns a ranch. So the bad guy lives at the ranch. The fight scene is going to be in the bar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going to hit a bus at one point.

It gives you all this production value. So you write backwards. So for bedhead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I even did that with a camera. So I've been shooting video all this time. And one thing I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">wished I could do on video, I never could with slow motion or stop motion even. So when I got that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">crappy world war two camera, they gave us in film school, I mean, I was so pissed. Like this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">camera I've been trying to get my hands. I could have bought this for 50 bucks at a bond shop, old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Bill and how wind up. You couldn't even see through the lens. You were seeing through an approximation of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">lens, but you could shoot slow motion. I could do reverse photography. If I filmed upside down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I could do, cause if I do a fast push into her, I'll never get the focus in. Right. So I started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with it in focus, went back, pulled backwards on a chair and then reversed it, flipped it. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like it stops on a dime and focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. The number of times I've seen you shoot backwards is incredible. Like to achieve a certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">feeling, a certain experience, a certain, uh, certain effect, sometimes shooting in reverse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">plus the sound effect layer, you can create this reality that's surreal. Yeah. That then results in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the story that you wanted. Like you have, you have to be functioning some kind of different space,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">time continuum. Start putting it together. Right. So I've got this different camera. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">what now I go like, oh, no, I don't want to shoot the same kind of movie. If I got a camera now that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">can do that, I can do stop motion. So that's why there's an animated title sequence at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause I go, wow, I I'm a cartoonist. If I set the camera up here, I can slow it down enough. It's not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not a frame by frame, but if I get it down like two frames a second, I can just tap it and it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe get one frame off. So I did 300 drawings by hand for that opening title sequence. Holy shit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That was, that was you doing it by hand. Yeah. So you watch that and this is a throwaway title</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sequence, but I really want to, this thing to win awards. Okay. Hold on a second. How long did that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">take to draw that? That's a lot. That's a lot of work. I drew it. I drew it over. Well, I was a daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">cartoonist by then, so I was pretty fast, but still it's, that's why it's only penciled. It's not inked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but it looks great. I mean, it's the cameras going around and all kinds of crazy stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's just all fake by paper. I took me all night to shoot it. Cause I remember I walked into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the film school the next day, you know, like all sleeping. And I told one of the fellow students,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, wow, I was up all night doing this animated title sequence. And he went,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">why are you putting so much work in this? They're not going to, they're not going to grade you any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">differently. And I was like, grades, get an A walking in here. I'm trying to get out of this town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not doing this for fucking grades. I got, I want people to see what I can do now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to see what I can do now with this. So a lot of the story came from the limitations or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">actually the freedoms of that camera. I couldn't have done that story on video. So when I saw,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">wow, okay, I can do reverse photography. I can do stop motion. She has to have special powers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because if she has special powers and I can utilize, I can really milk this camera for all it can get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's one of my shots.

And as it goes back, you pull it back. And then when you reverse it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it goes, and it looks so good.

And then just her like getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the hose.

I was doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it by phone that way.

Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I didn't know if any of it was exposing or if the film camera was working until I finished the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">whole movie.

That's why I only did one take.

Right. I thought it was, I thought it was going to be a test film. Yeah. It's the only movie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in history ever made where the filmmaker did not think anyone would see it and expect it and even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">set it up that way. I mean, why would I make an action movie for the Spanish market called basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the guitar player promises? No action. No one's going to watch it. But I thought if someone actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">picks it up and has the balls to watch this thing, they're going to be surprised. I put a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">action. It was just to learn from, I just needed to make it for as little as possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">see how much I could sell it for. If I could double my money. Great. I can make another one and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get more practice. It was just, I was so intrigued by this idea because you've heard advice about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">screenwriting. I heard advice back then that I thought was ridiculous. It said, it's going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you a long time to be a good screenwriter. So write three scripts and throw them away. The fourth script</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">will be the good one. I was like, it's so hard to write a script. Who's going to write three full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">scripts? No one, they throw them away. Wouldn't it be better if you write three scripts and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">shoot each one and be the cameraman, be the sound guy, be everything. Cause that way you're learning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">not just writing, you're learning how to make a movie. So that was my idea. I'm going to make three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of these, hide it on Spanish video, but make money back. That's like my own film school paying me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">paying me to learn. So the first one I thought, let me just shoot it. One take each, because my friend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Carlos lives in Mexico, if we shoot two takes, most of the cost is to film. I've just doubled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">my budget. So let me just shoot one take. Some of it's going to not come out, but I'm not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2142" target="_blank">00:35:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to know what, I'm not going to shoot a safety one. That doubles my, let me, let me see. Some things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">might come out. I expected like 70% of it to maybe be okay, but 30% I might have to come reshoot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which is fine. I just drive back there. And then I just reshoot just those shots. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just went, let's shoot. We stop, we come back. Then I send it off to develop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're shooting two weeks consecutively to get film shipped back and forth from Mexico to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if it came out. You just couldn't do it. I just had to, you know, double down on it, do it one take,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. I remember one time I was still an actor, man, I told you to run through that shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He goes, oh, let me do it. No, one take, dude. Just think about next time. Do what I say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't think anyone was going to see it. So you, and because you don't think anyone's going to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it, you end up doing something remarkable, which is, well, I'm just going to make something for myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if I was making a movie that was going to go to Sundance, I wouldn't have made that movie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have thought, okay, I got to get serious.

Yeah, that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that's it. That's the process. And then it says gels and mediums. And I'm like, oh, this is a book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically about painting, but it applies to music, editing, cinematography, writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all the same.

Now I believe that that same person, even if they only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">do music could literally jump from job to job creatively and do a superior job than most technicians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's also something to say there about the learning, the technical aspects of an art,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you, you collide with the, uh, uh, with the experts.

In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I had seen this movie already.

Oh, cool. Cool. Okay. And so I went ahead and saw his movie and Telluride. And I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy shit, this guy's in black again, just like the mariachis dressed in black and action. And I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3895" target="_blank">01:04:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, we're going to like each other.

They asked us to do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3904" target="_blank">01:05:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">panel discussion about violence and movies in the nineties, even though it was only 92.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're on a panel together and that's where I met him. And he's like, Hey, Robert, your agent told me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">about you. And I was like, yeah, I saw your movie Reservoir Dogs. And he goes, Oh, you got to come to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">screening and I'm going to come see yours. So he came to mariachi and I videotaped the audience reactions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">because they were insane, insane reactions to it. But I have the first screening. He saw mariachi sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">next to me laughing. He's laughing at everything. He was just the best audience. I have his recording of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3937" target="_blank">01:05:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">first time he saw mariachi. Oh no, really? Yeah. Cause I taped it. He's so loud. Cause he's right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">next to me. Well, just like you, but even probably even more than you. He's a fan. He watches, he just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3949" target="_blank">01:05:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">loves movies. He loves movies. In fact, I, the next time I heard him laugh that way, was it that his own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3955" target="_blank">01:05:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">premiere for Kill Bill? We're watching Kill Bill and he's laughing like it's somebody else's movie. He still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3960" target="_blank">01:06:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">enjoys the movies. It's so he loves, but all the actors did. And it's like, that's the kind of energy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you really love. But I'll tell you what, what, what happened. Um, I'm not a very shy person, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3970" target="_blank">01:06:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">very shy. I'd have to go talk. I'm sure you probably feel like you're not an orator or anything, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3975" target="_blank">01:06:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just have to go do it. I thought, well, man, I'm gonna have to introduce my film and talk about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards. I'm afraid of that. What am I going to do? I don't, I've never talked in front of more than five people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">before. So I went to see this other movie and it was good. And I was watching and then the director</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">comes up at the end and goes, yeah, well, that was my movie. And, um, you know, uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">here's the writer. And it's like, oh man, I don't like the movie anymore. This guy's kind of a dick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3999" target="_blank">01:06:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I cannot do that. I'm going to have to go be who they imagined made that movie. So I wrote out my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4008" target="_blank">01:06:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whole intro. It was like a 20 minute intro because no one had ever heard of anybody making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a movie for no money, much less without a crew, much less, you know, the way I did it was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4018" target="_blank">01:06:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very new. Nobody knew it was possible. So my whole intro is like, you'll see the Columbia logo slapped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4026" target="_blank">01:07:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in front. It's probably cost more than the whole movie. And then I go through, this is how I made it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4031" target="_blank">01:07:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with a wheelchair for a dolly, a turtle. You know, I wrote around things I had. I mentioned the turtle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4036" target="_blank">01:07:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the pit bull, the bus, the ranch, all that stuff. Right. So then when they see the movie,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">in fact, I think my wife was in the audience, she said at Sundance, people were laughing so much at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4045" target="_blank">01:07:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">your intro. They just wanted to hear a story like this so badly. I heard someone next to me say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4049" target="_blank">01:07:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to vote for his movie. They hadn't even seen the movie just because the story was so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4054" target="_blank">01:07:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They wanted that movie to be great. And when they see the turtle, big cheers. When they see the pit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">bull, big cheers. When they see the school bus cheers. But then when they see how we use it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">he slams into it and falls in it, they fricking lose their minds because they know how I put it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4070" target="_blank">01:07:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">together. They know that the rubber bands and the popsicle sticks, I already set it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4074" target="_blank">01:07:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why that audience, I would just hate the reaction. They're so with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4079" target="_blank">01:07:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The context is so key. Like you can watch Mariachi and go, Hey, yeah, this looks like a 7,000 on a movie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4086" target="_blank">01:08:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you know the story behind it, suddenly I was curious. I hadn't seen it in a long time. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4091" target="_blank">01:08:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">watching it for the 20th anniversary. We did a screening and the first few shots come up and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4096" target="_blank">01:08:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Oh yeah, well, it looks like a $7,000 movie. And then it just keeps going. And it's in the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4100" target="_blank">01:08:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">once we're in the jail cell and the shooting's happening and I realized, Oh my God, we had these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">blanks that only fired one shot and it would jam. So I had to show it going, use the sound effect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4113" target="_blank">01:08:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">cut to the other guy, cut back to have another one go. I had to do these editing tricks to make it look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">like, and then repeat a few frames. So it goes, so it looks like a machine gun, all this stuff that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm start sweating as I'm watching it going.

When I finally had to do a real movie, I was operating the camera in my first real movie with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4137" target="_blank">01:08:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">crew.

You focus?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4145" target="_blank">01:09:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Shit, I had to do my own focusing on the last movie.

I picked this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4705" target="_blank">01:18:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">diverse group of filmmakers, gave them $7,000 and we documented them making a feature two weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4711" target="_blank">01:18:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I did.

So I made a movie called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4750" target="_blank">01:19:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">red 11 based on my experiences in the medical hospital, but I'll turn it into a sci-fi thriller</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4756" target="_blank">01:19:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just to use that as, so that I can use like somebody getting stabbed in the eye. So I can still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4760" target="_blank">01:19:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have more elements to show how you can do camera tricks and stuff with no money.

Um, but the movie itself can make it for nothing. But I brought my son aboard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4776" target="_blank">01:19:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as my number one who hadn't been working with me in a while.

So by getting them working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the movies together, they came to be super excited. By the end of the day, I thought for sure, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4799" target="_blank">01:19:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to hate this. Even though it's only two weeks, they've got other interests. They don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4802" target="_blank">01:20:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">want to be filmmakers.

And he went, dad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4813" target="_blank">01:20:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the actor didn't show up after the first day.

So life is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">unpredictable, just like a movie set. So I realized I'm going to make them all work on my movies now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4849" target="_blank">01:20:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's teaching them about life.

It's about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4855" target="_blank">01:20:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">life lessons, about how you take on something impossible, turn chicken shit to chicken salad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4859" target="_blank">01:20:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and make it work. And that's the straw and that's life. That's the process of life. So many people say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4865" target="_blank">01:21:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I'm not ready to make my projects.

And Quentin was like that. So I met him at the festivals. He saw Mariachi. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6119" target="_blank">01:41:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">loved it.

So I'd go show him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6164" target="_blank">01:42:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like storyboards from Desperado and he'd come act out scenes of Pulp Fiction.

He showed it to some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6204" target="_blank">01:43:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">directors and I wasn't able to go.

At 2.40 a.m. when after I dropped him off at his house, I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6214" target="_blank">01:43:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">oh wait, how did your movie come out?

And I was trying to be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6232" target="_blank">01:43:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">supportive friend going, oh man, he was so excited about this movie.

So I went home and I called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6245" target="_blank">01:44:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the directors that were at the screening and they go, yeah, this isn't the one for him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6249" target="_blank">01:44:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not, they had, none of them saw it.

But everyone else was like, what's he doing? We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6273" target="_blank">01:44:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">artists.

Not you or anyone around you, except maybe one or two people. So he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6285" target="_blank">01:44:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">there's one person like, oh yeah, who is your Spielberg?

She's the only one who said, there's something here. No one else was seeing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6293" target="_blank">01:44:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">was saying that. He said, in fact, because he remembered suddenly he'd forgotten the story,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6298" target="_blank">01:44:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but if it wasn't in my journal, I would have forgot it too. He goes, in fact, one of my friends,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6302" target="_blank">01:45:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Simon said, I want to sit you down and tell you all the things that are wrong with your movie,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6306" target="_blank">01:45:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'll wait till you get back from the Cannes Film Festival.

I've only made one movie myself. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6314" target="_blank">01:45:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">nevermind. I guess, I guess we're all wrong. So even he didn't expect that at all. So that was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6319" target="_blank">01:45:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">shock, you know, even to him.

Commit to a body</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6326" target="_blank">01:45:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">of work.

Like I asked Jim Cameron, I said, do you see your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6339" target="_blank">01:45:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">movie really clearly?

Cause it seems like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6344" target="_blank">01:45:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he goes, it's like really far. It's out of focus. And you work on it and you work on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6349" target="_blank">01:45:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it starts coming.

I thought maybe he had laser vision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6354" target="_blank">01:45:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or something, but no, even him, he doesn't really know, but he feels that he can make decisions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6358" target="_blank">01:45:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he understands what a creative drive is and how to just keep being relentless about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6364" target="_blank">01:46:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not like they have all the, proximity is huge.

But one thing I noticed was that the town we were shot in, the Mexican town,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7009" target="_blank">01:56:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the same town I shot Mariachi.

And I went, this guy's got something. So I went to him and I said, I got a movie we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7040" target="_blank">01:57:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do someday. This was 94. We didn't make this movie for 15 years. Machete. You're going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7046" target="_blank">01:57:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Machete. I had, I had an idea for Machete then. It wasn't the same story. I had seen a story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7053" target="_blank">01:57:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, Mariachi, the guy from March sent me this funny story. He said, Hey, look at this story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7057" target="_blank">01:57:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that the USDA and FBI sometimes would hire a Mexican federal to come do a job for 25 grand that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7065" target="_blank">01:57:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't want to get their own guys killed on.

I said, we're going to do this someday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7079" target="_blank">01:57:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked about it for years and never did it. Never had got around to doing it. So when I did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7084" target="_blank">01:58:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Spy Kids, I put him in Spy Kids and I said, Hey, let's pay tribute to that character we never got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7089" target="_blank">01:58:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">make.

But then a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7095" target="_blank">01:58:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">years later, Quentin and I were doing Grindhouse and he'd already done Dustal Dahl with me.

Danny shows up. I brought Cheech out of retirement and put him in my movie. I needed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7108" target="_blank">01:58:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">create my own Latin star system because all my scripts, because when you write in your own voice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7112" target="_blank">01:58:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to write probably somebody that's Latin, you know, so you need to have a star system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7116" target="_blank">01:58:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that matches that so that you don't have trouble casting and people are like, well, you can't hire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7120" target="_blank">01:58:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this person. So I built up my own star system. So Danny was one of my stars. So after we're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7125" target="_blank">01:58:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Grindhouse, we had to do fake trailers for Grindhouse.

That'll be so fun. Finally get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7137" target="_blank">01:58:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that out of our system.

Just still being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7142" target="_blank">01:59:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that resourceful guy.

Can you let us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7147" target="_blank">01:59:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">send it to us for a couple of days screen test?

People were screaming at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7168" target="_blank">01:59:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the premiere. You couldn't even hear it. They just wanted that movie so badly because there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7173" target="_blank">01:59:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">blaxploitation in the seventies. There was never mexploitation. It felt like this should have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7177" target="_blank">01:59:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">existed, but it didn't. It's Mexican superhero. They just never seen anything like that. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7182" target="_blank">01:59:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">now, you know, but like even his mom calls him a shame. Like he just became this guy. And I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7187" target="_blank">01:59:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">saw 250 movies that he's been in. Machete is his most famous one. So for five years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7193" target="_blank">01:59:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">five years, people would come up to us and say, where's Machete? Why aren't you? Where's the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7201" target="_blank">02:00:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">when's that movie coming out? We're like, it's not a real movie, but when it looks real, we want to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7205" target="_blank">02:00:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that movie. So we finally made the movie because people just asked for it. And I used, I wanted to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7210" target="_blank">02:00:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I was adamant about being resourceful again. All those shots that are in the trailer are really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7215" target="_blank">02:00:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">great. I got to reverse engineer the trailer into a movie so that I can use that shot that's in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7220" target="_blank">02:00:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">trailer. Like this girl in the waterfall. Why would this girl be in the waterfall? I don't have a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7224" target="_blank">02:00:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">clever way that he gets the bad guy.

So every time there's a shot in the trailer, it's in the movie, but I shot all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7239" target="_blank">02:00:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">footage around to lead up to it. That's another fun, creative exercise is to reverse engineer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7243" target="_blank">02:00:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something.

You just threw a bunch of cards out basically with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7247" target="_blank">02:00:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that trailer. And now you got to go make a movie using all those cards. That's like a creative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7252" target="_blank">02:00:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">exercise that I thought so satisfying.

You're, you're actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7257" target="_blank">02:00:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">known in part, maybe you can correct me, but to do pretty unexpected, surprising, kind of interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7263" target="_blank">02:01:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">casting.

The second aspect of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7268" target="_blank">02:01:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that I heard the story that you can just get an actor in and out in just a few days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7273" target="_blank">02:01:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really fast.

What cameras</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7851" target="_blank">02:10:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">do we have?

What's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7855" target="_blank">02:10:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on the B camera? Steadicam.

At one point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7861" target="_blank">02:11:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to lower it.

So I just lay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7931" target="_blank">02:12:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">on the pad and rock up and down.

Right. So I go home, I cut it before I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8044" target="_blank">02:14:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">even have the visual effects.

You can already see when the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8053" target="_blank">02:14:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">bullets, not there, you can tell by the sound where they're going to be.

And then this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8075" target="_blank">02:14:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">bullet bounced way over there.

Because if you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9334" target="_blank">02:35:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I want to shoot my movie, but I need a cameraman and I need somebody who knows how to light it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9338" target="_blank">02:35:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Your, your, I need list keeps growing.

So that remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9348" target="_blank">02:35:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that script analogy where the guy said, throw away three scripts.

So I get better at each one of those jobs. So I can learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9357" target="_blank">02:35:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to be technical. My technical compatibility was so little. Like I'm literally calling the guy on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9362" target="_blank">02:36:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">phone.

That's really the key. So Jim Cameron is like that. Jim Cameron,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9373" target="_blank">02:36:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">when you think of those guys, George Lucas, very technical and very creative.

And it's very, very powerful. And a lot of creative people, again, it's against their nature to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9392" target="_blank">02:36:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">be technical.

And now you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9833" target="_blank">02:43:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of let go of the technical and then be creative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9836" target="_blank">02:43:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

And, uh, he said, wow, you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12389" target="_blank">03:26:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to be rich and famous in four years. It's based on what I read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12395" target="_blank">03:26:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">He was like, really flight home like 17 or 18, four years later, I've done mariachi. And I went to him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12402" target="_blank">03:26:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">later at a reunion and I said, you called it. You said I was going to be, why did you say that? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12407" target="_blank">03:26:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">he's like, I said, it looked like he would never say that to somebody.
