And I don't know anyone, what would you tell someone who doesn't know that? I think first and foremost, probably do some research, but don't just follow Yelp. Or if let's just say you do follow Yelp, and you find a restaurant that has a three and a half star rating, but that restaurant has a lot of fives and a lot of ones.</p><p>That right off the bat looks something that's probably gonna be awesome. Right? If you dive deeper into the data, and you realize most of the people that give it ones are people that don't understand the kind of cuisine. Most people that give it fives are the people that do understand the cuisine, that's probably a good thing.</p><p>So the numbers don't always tell you the truth, but what's behind it.</p></div></div></body></html>
