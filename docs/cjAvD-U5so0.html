For instance, the Snyder laboratory published a paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier this year, showing that different people spike insulin in response to different types of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">carbohydrates. Things like the glycemic index, which we may be familiar with because they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially a readout of how much a given food impacts blood sugar, depends on who you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They identified so-called potato spikers, they literally refer to them as potato spikers in this paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">versus grape spikers.

In other words, individual variability matters. We talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that individual variability in the context of nutrition, also in the context of fiber. It turns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">out that fiber is something that people generally believe is good for your health. I certainly believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Well, different types of fibers impact people differently. Some people experience systemic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">inflammation of their brain and body when they eat certain types of fibers. That's bad. Other people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">experience systematic decreases in inflammation when they eat certain types of fibers. The key is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">identify which category you're in and therefore which fibers to eat. And as it turns out, different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">foods have different fiber types. So, it's tractable. There are things you can do about it. We also talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about GLP-1 drugs and how those impact longevity. This is something that's very controversial and very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">timely right now. And we discuss how different psychological interventions. Yep. The Snyder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">lab has even looked at how different psychological interventions impact the genes you make and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">proteins you make and their effect on health span and lifespan.

And now for my discussion with Dr. Michael Snyder. Dr. Michael</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Snyder, welcome. Dr. Michael Snyder: Great to be here. I'd like to start by talking about glucose regulation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and food and food choice, exercise, sleep, and how they all interact. But I want to make it very simple to start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">How is it that what we eat impacts our glucose response? And maybe you could tell us a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about what a healthy glucose response looks like, because by most people's view,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">any inflection in blood glucose is a quote unquote spike. But what are the sorts of spikes that matter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for health? And what are the sorts of spikes in blood glucose or what are called glucose excursions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that you know, okay, well, that's a normal response to eating some food. And then it goes back down to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">baseline. I think this is especially important nowadays with all the interest in metabolic health,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in how particular types of foods like processed foods are indeed far worse for us and on and on. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if you could just give us your view and understanding of glucose excursions, what they mean when they're good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when they're bad? Well, I would say that, you know, high, long, prolonged spikes is obviously pretty bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But certain things like if you eat a grape, grapes pretty loaded with sugar, but it's a pretty transient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">spike, it'll go up. And so that would be a transit one. And actually, when you do strength training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, for exercise, you break down glucagon, which is a, you know, it's a polymer of sugar that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">break down, gives you energy, that's important for when you're doing exercise and training, and that will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">give a glucose spike. I get a glucose spike every morning when I weight train. So that would be a normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">healthy one, but it's transient, it goes away pretty quickly. What's quickly? Within 30 minutes, maybe most 60</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes. Now, I'm a special case, I'm a type two diabetic. So my spikes go higher and longer than most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people. So yeah, mine are not good spikes, but we can get into that. So what is a good spike? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the calibration people mostly use this time and range. It's a simple metric, meaning if you're a healthy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">person, your glucose is normally for most people around 90. And if you're off, you will go higher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">than that. For most people, you want to keep your glucose between 70 and 140. If you're healthy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for diabetics, they say try and keep it between 70 and 180. And that is what people try to do. And most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">healthy people, it's pretty easy. And I think one of the things we've done, you've heard about continuous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">glucose monitors, these devices, and I'm wearing one, and some of your staff I know are wearing them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. And they're over the counter now. You put these on your arm and they measure your glucose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">every five minutes. So you can see exactly what's going on. And so we put them on so-called normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people, pre-diabetics and some diabetics. It was already well known, diabetics will spike their glucose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">through the roof too high for too long. And then the people devised, especially type 1s, control mechanisms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for releasing insulin and controlling all of that. But for the average person, that wasn't so well known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at the time we were doing this. And it was a bit of a surprise to see that a lot of people, some did a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very good glucose control, but some pre-diabetics were what we call moderate spikers. We came up and named</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">glucotypes. It's a way of quantifying this. And then some people were spiking just as bad as diabetics and had no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">idea. And so it was a way of revealing what was going on. So it's recommended that you try to stay in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this 71-40, but it is a bit arbitrary, but it's not a bad rule of thumb to work by for the average person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, some people have very, very good glucose controls. Some are moderate spikers and some are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">severe. And it's pretty clear that excessive spiking, especially in diabetics, is associated with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cardiovascular disease and other things. There's some pretty strong papers out there on that. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you do want to keep it under control. And there's a very strong correlation between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this time and range measurement I mentioned, and something called hemoglobin A1c. That's a measure of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your steady state glucose. And so if you have high hemoglobin A1c, that's typically how we classify people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for diabetes and pre-diabetes. If you're over 6'5 or over, you're classified as diabetic. If you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">5'7 to 6'4, you're pre-diabetic. And if you're under that, you're so-called normal. And this time and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">range will actually correlate very, very well with that. So it's a surrogate measure for that. But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually pretty cool because you can precisely see what's going on in real time, unlike a hemoglobin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">A1c measurement, which you get periodically. So if you want to dig into that further, I would say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, what's cool about these CGMs is that you wear them, like I'm wearing one now, you can wear them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for about 14 days, depends on the particular device. And you see exactly what foods do what to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're all different. So some people spike to bananas, some to potatoes, some to pasta, some to white</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bread, some to brown bread. And so this is shown by Aaron Siegel's lab at the Weissman and our lab had found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something similar. And it's very personal. And so we've been spending a lot of time trying to dig into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what's behind that. So different people, glucose spike to different foods. It's hard to predict on the basis of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">something like a chart of glycemic index, for instance. So if I understand correctly, and I have glanced at those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">papers, you know, I might be able to eat mango with nothing else, and my blood glucose doesn't go out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of range, or at least not for very long. Whereas somebody else might have a very big and prolonged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">spike in blood glucose to mango. But maybe there are things they can eat that I can't eat, like, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">know, sourdough bread or something. By the way, I can eat sourdough bread, but just by way of example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">A hundred percent.

I want to talk a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about measurement today.

A brisk walk for 15</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes or 20 minutes after you eat will help suppress those glucose spikes. In fact, some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">these companies that have set up around personalized management of glucose, I'm involved with one called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">January AI and there's others out there too.

They'll actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">teach you that. And you can see it personally. And so one thing we've done is, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">most people spike to white rice.

And is that simply due to the low level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">muscle contractions associated with walking, they're just acting as a glucose scavenger?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I assumed, yes, that you're burning it off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you see this study out of, I forget the university in Texas, I think it might have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">University of Houston, where they looked at people doing what they called soleus pushups.

They called it a calf pushup, but all that nomenclature is kind of silly. What it really is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is keeping your toes on the floor and lifting your heels.

And now people had to continue doing this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was pretty effective. And I would prefer to see people go out and take a walk after they eat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but not all of us can get up and walk after a meal.

Maybe do some of the things I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">hadn't heard the one you said, but maybe that's a better thing to do.

And so I haven't, but for other people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I know they like standing tests. I've, I've heard from some people though, or it may not be overall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as effective. So I don't know. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I think the exercise snacks are a terrific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that, you know, air squats or even just pacing, these kinds of things. I think we underestimate the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the extent to which our evolutionary history drove a lot more movement every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no way we sat eight hours a day in ancient times. Yes. I 100% agree. Yeah. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">People had to be active.

But if people are finding that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">certain foods or food combinations are making them feel sleepy afterwards, I do think that the glucose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">monitors are useful for parsing which foods are doing what. I'd like to talk a little bit about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about meal timing and food timing. Sure. For many years, just by virtue of preference,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I will hydrate and I make sure to get electrolytes, water, and caffeine in the morning. Okay. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">try to exercise in the morning. If I don't, I'll do it in the afternoon, but generally in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And my first meal always lands somewhere around 11 AM or so.

Is there any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">evidence that introducing a period of fasting at one point in the day versus say later in the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like having breakfast, lunch, and an early dinner versus lunch, an afternoon snack, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a typical dinner of, you know, between, you know, 6:30 and 8:30 PM?

Right. We're not talking about weight loss now. I'm just talking about glucose control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot to unpack there. So we have some studies where we put CGMs on people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">smart watches. We can track their activity. They did food logging and exercise logging as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tracked them in incredible detail. And they were also very well phenotyped for their glucose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">dysregulation. And we should probably talk about that a little bit about muscle insulin resistance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">beta cell defects, things like that. So we were trying to relate what was their, what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">glucose dysregulation, some phenotype with their lifestyle. And not just their lifestyle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what they did, but when they did it. And what we found is that, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some simple things already known is that if you have your bigger meal first thing in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you generally have lower glucose and don't, and not later at night. So people had their biggest meal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">their biggest energy consumption. Later in the day is dinner, which is awkward socially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's what most of us have our big meal or many of us do. Those folks will have a higher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">glucose and starchy vegetables as well known. Those folks have higher glucose, but interesting fruits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people ate a lot of fruits as their major source of carbs had lower. That's because of the fiber</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that's in there that helps them. Turns out most people don't get enough sleep. And so those who slept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">longer actually had lower glucose. But some of the things we could tease out were,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">when should you exercise? If you look at the party line out there from various studies, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you should exercise in the afternoon to get your best benefit. But we found that that depends on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">form of dysregulation you have. If your muscle is resistant, you actually get better benefit by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">exercising in the morning for glucose the next day. If you're muscle insulin resistant. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So to unpack that a little bit. So you probably know that, you know, you eat something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you get glucose if it's sugary, and your insulin obviously, you know, helps control that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">stimulates your cells and take that up. And if you're insulin resistant, especially muscle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because muscle is a major consumer of glucose, means you're not taking up your glucose right. So you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">insulin resistant, and you're don't take up glucose, and you wind up with high glucose spikes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are other forms of diabetes. So to break this down, or glucose dysregulation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there are people who don't make insulin early in life, that would be called type one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can still become insulin deficient in making insulin later in life for type two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can also have what are called beta cell defects. So insulin is produced by your pancreas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">your beta cells. And I myself in type two diabetic, I have a beta cell defect, took me a while to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that out. Meaning, I may consume fine, my cells respond, but I don't release it from the pancreas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's things called hepatic insulin resistance. So your liver is insulin resistant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and other forms as well, fat insulin resistance as well. So we've now gotten into dividing up diabetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, basically, classically, people will group people into type one, which is 10% of people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or type two, which is the other 90% of diabetics. Well, it turns out that's a really broad category that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can easily be subdivided into what we call sub-phenotypes, these different forms of glucose dysregulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we think that's a big deal, because it affects the drugs you take. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I am a beta cell defect, and I didn't respond. I went through exercise, used to be a runner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and I shifted to weight training about, it'll almost be nine years soon, with the idea of building muscle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">mass, which failed miserably. My glucose was gradually going up. So I shifted to weight training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I gained 10 pounds of muscle mass. I do whole body MRI, 20 of them in the last eight or nine years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I basically did gain 10 pounds of muscle mass that had no effect on my glucose control. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">reason for that was that I'm not muscle-inter resistant. I'm a beta cell defect. So I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">gain as much muscle as I want. It's not going to help me release insulin from my pancreas. So knowing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your sub-phenotype is a big deal. But then I respond to certain drug, Rapinolide, that actually promotes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that release. So knowing your sub-phenotype determines your drugs. But it also turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this whole lifestyle thing I mentioned earlier is a big deal, and coming back to some of the food stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we found that if you're basically insulin resistant, muscle-inter resistant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you will spike to potatoes and pasta, but not if you're insulin sensitive. And if you have beta cell defect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you also spike to potatoes. So you actually, you can sub-phenotype people according to what their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">glucose dysregulation is, and that affects how you react to foods. And so then the obvious thing to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is modify your eating behavior on those foods so that you can basically live a healthier life is the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so how are you going to sub-phenotype? Well, the way we do it now is super expensive. It's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we do these gold standard tests, take several hours, hundreds if not thousands of dollars,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">depends how you do it. We, believe it or not, can do it just from a simple glucose curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So you may not realize that when you put one of these glucose monitors on you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and you drink a shot of glucose, you'll have a curve. And that shape is different for different people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and that depends on their sub-phenotype. So meaning if your muscle is resistant, you'll have a certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shape. And if your beta cell is a different shape, and if you're a combination of things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and there are other factors, by the way, that play in here, like your microbiome. So the gut's in your,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the microbes in your gut all play in this. And so they basically affect the shape of your curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we're not there yet, but we're good for some of these, like for muscle and so resistant. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">quite accurately predict whether your muscle is resistant just from the shape of that glucose curve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which you can get now from an over-the-counter purchase at, at a drug store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Super interesting. There's a, as you mentioned, a ton to unpack there. I just want to make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand a couple of the points you made before we go forward. You said the vast number of, of papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that have explored ideal exercise timing point to the afternoon as the best time. I've seen those papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">also. And my takeaway from those, the kind of gestalt of, of, of those papers in my view is that if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you're interested in performance, that the afternoon is better because your body's warm, body temperature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tends to be appropriate for performance. Whereas, although some people wake up ready to go first thing in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">most people don't feel as energized first thing in the morning. Some do, but most don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I understand correctly, for many people, in particular people with muscle insulin resistance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">doing resistance training would be preferable to doing cardiovascular training for blood glucose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">regulation. And doing that resistance training early in the day, it sounded like you were going to tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">us that it sets a kind of a, a trend toward better glucose regulation throughout the day. But I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">want to, uh, lead the witness here. I want to make sure that that's true before we conclude that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we haven't taken apart for that particular study, the difference between resistance training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and there's more of a general activity measurement. So people are more active in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">if they're muscle insulin resistant will benefit, have better glucose levels the next day. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't yet done resistance, but I'm very interested in this. In fact, we have a separate study around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">high intensity training running versus long distance running. Uh, and can happy to talk about that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's still in progress. So I, I wouldn't say we've totally done what you've gotten at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but we would like to dissect the resistance training versus a aerobic or endurance type of training. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the bottom line is of course, exercising anytime is better than not exercising at all. So I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we'd all agree with that, but we do think you get better glucose benefits if you are muscle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and resistant during the morning. And I also do believe that, yeah, building your muscle mass will help,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with actually reducing muscle resistance. Thank you for that clarification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned different types of diabetes. So general categories are type one diabetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, these people don't make insulin. They need to inject insulin or, or, or deliver insulin through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a time release mechanism or something of that sort. Type two diabetes, I understand to be insulin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">insensitivity, which, um, is bad. You want your cells to be sensitive to insulin so that insulin can bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the glucose into those cells so they can use them. Right. You're now subdividing this type two diabetes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the insulin insensitivity into muscle insulin insensitive as well as other tissues being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">insensitive. What percentage... But it's more than that. Meaning there's a beta cell defect where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">don't release insulin from your pancreas. That's has nothing to do with insulin resistance. That's more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a mechanistic thing. Now, why that, that defect exists isn't so clear. Uh, Mike is kind of interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, although he still don't fully understand it. But, um, then there's also incretin defects. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">incretin are these GLPs that everybody's heard about. Ozempic is a mimic of those and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Mongero and things like that. Uh, and so there are people with defects that way. So we're all different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, and we can now subtype that. We can say this person's got mostly an incretin defect. This one's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">muscle ins resistant. This is a beta cell defect. Uh, and so, and some people are combinations of those. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">not pure one or the other. So we think actually the subtyping is a big deal because again, it determines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your lifestyle choices you might make to better control your glucose and of course drug responses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. So we think that's important. We know that many, many people in the United States and elsewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">sadly are overweight or just clinically overweight. And I think it's about 30% of people in the United</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">States are clinically obese. When you talk about type two diabetes and these different, um, subphenotypes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as you're referring to them. Right. Um, what percentage of people in the United States do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are type two diabetic that have some sort of either insulin, um, insensitivity and that's the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">versus, you know, they're making plenty of insulin, but they can't release it. I mean, what, what sorts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers are we talking about here? Because I think for listeners, they're probably thinking like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, like I, uh, as long as I don't eat too much sugar, I feel fine. Does that mean that they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have type two diabetes? People who, um, perhaps are of a healthy weight, does that mean they don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">type two diabetes or any of these insulin management problems? It sounds like we don't know the real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers, but if you were to guesstimate what the percentages are of people out there who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">some issue with insulin management at a physiological level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, well, if you include beta cell defects as part of insulin management, then the number is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">very high. But I honestly don't know the answer. I don't think we fully know the answer because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people haven't done this subphenotyping like I've described. We don't know how many people have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">incretin defects. We are getting there with insulin resistance and such, but I don't think we're fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there. But I want to correct something that you said. I mean, it's very much the case when you see someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">who's thin, you can't assume they're not diabetic. This is very common, especially in South Asians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to see thin diabetics. Uh, and I'm a good example. No one would call me overweight, uh, by any definition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm a diabetic and I have a beta cell defect. Uh, and I used to think a lot of people who are thin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">diabetics probably have beta cell defects, but it's not that simple. It's some do and some don't. Some are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">some are insulin resistant. And so, um, and then there are other people, believe it or not, who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">very obese by any clinical measure, what have you. And they have very good glucose control. So there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of things we don't fully understand and a lot of it probably does. It fits in this idea that this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not a simple process. Uh, we have many organ systems involved in glucose control. Your liver, your pancreas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">your muscles we mentioned, but even your brain is a major glucose consumer. Uh, and so we have all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">different organ systems. And then on top of that, we have all these different biochemical pathways that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">engaged as well. We mentioned the insulin one, but there's incretin, uh, which are these GLP things that promote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">insulin release, but they probably have other effects as well. I don't fully understand. I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone does all the effects of incretins.

Let's explore for a moment some of the things that we've heard these GLP-1 drugs, uh, are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2148" target="_blank">00:35:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">effective for. Yeah. Uh, certainly for, um, diabetics to better, type 2 diabetics to better control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">their, uh, blood glucose.

But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't healthy.

And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because people are taking Monjaro and taking other things that are dropping their blood glucose.

What, if any data from your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">genomics data and these large scale studies that you're doing point to the fact that the combination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of augmenting GLP-1 with these drugs and exercise is, is beneficial.

Yeah. You know, we hear that fat around the viscera, around our organs is the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to really worry about. Um, and anytime I hear something like that, I think, okay, that sounds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like a reason to not lose fat elsewhere, but you know, what do we know about the, the health risks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of intravisceral fat versus subcutaneous fat? Yeah. I'm not an expert here, but it does seem pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">clear that obviously fat around your organs isn't good. Fatty liver being a good example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, when I went on GLPs, my, I had a little bit of fatty liver just disappeared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think a lot of people are thinking this way that your pancreas is and beta cells in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">very subject to stress. And fat does put stress on your organs, no question. And so it may be one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons, you know, your pancreas and your beta cell in particular is very sensitive to fat is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it does cause stress. We know fat is very associated with inflammation. So obesity is a good example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more BCR, higher BMI, again, not perfect correlation, but higher inflammation. And so all that does tie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">together and your immune system is tied in this in ways I would say we don't fully understand. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in general, the party line is a visceral fat is worse. And I think it's because of putting stress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">on your organ systems, uh, yeah, say versus subcutaneous. I'd like to take a quick break and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">acknowledge one of our sponsors, David. David makes a protein bar unlike any other.

This is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar. David protein bars also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">taste amazing. Even the texture is amazing. My favorite bar is the chocolate chip cookie dough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But then again, I also like the new chocolate peanut butter flavor and the chocolate brownie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">flavored. Basically, I like all the flavors a lot. They're all incredibly delicious. In fact, the toughest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge is knowing which ones to eat on which days and how many times per day. I limit myself to two per day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but I absolutely love them.

I do my best to eat my last bite of food at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of hours before I go to sleep. It doesn't always happen. What do we know about how evening and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">nighttime meals impact sleep and next day glucose levels and regulation? Well, the party line is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you should not eat three hours before sleeping. And I believe that, and that's true from the studies we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">run. That people who do have a gap and actually people who walk after dinner have lower glucose the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">next day.

So I think it's more complicated than that. I think, again, the party line will be, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">your glucose is kind of high at night and gradually goes down during the day and spike in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3174" target="_blank">00:52:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You get a cortisol spike, as you probably know, when you wake up and that's normal and that's healthy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">helps energize you for the day.

And these days I try not to make my biggest meal my dinner, which again can lead you into sleep with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And we always take a walk. We have dogs and walk our dog after dinner. It's become a routine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3245" target="_blank">00:54:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned earlier about behavior and I think the key for good behavior is to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3250" target="_blank">00:54:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">into these routines where you can just get into that.

Now, that's not so great for me because I travel a fair amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Likewise.

And one of the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting papers, to me anyway, in the last few years was a paper that I saw where they essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">had people breathe into a tube while they were sleeping and evaluated the different types of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">metabolism that were occurring during sleep. And it turns out that as we go from light sleep to deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sleep and then more rapid eye movement sleep as the night progresses, the brain and body transition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">through essentially every form of metabolism, glucose metabolism, ketogenic metabolism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a mixture of the two. And it seems like sleep is this, we don't know if it's like a test run or if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a reboot or we don't know what to call it, right? But it's just very clear that during sleep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of metabolism happening. So when you tell me that getting to bed at roughly the same time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or the same time every night improves blood glucose regulation, my first thought is, oh, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that makes sense. Because if you go to bed at the same time, then you're eating at roughly the same time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're exercising at roughly the same time. But it could also be the case that in sleep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we're getting a tuning up of the metabolic processes for the brain and body. Is there any evidence that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">supports that? Yeah. Again, I don't know from the metabolism standpoint. I like to say the things we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the most, we understand the least. Nutrition, right? How exactly does that work on all your different organs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Sleep. You know, I do like the idea of the sleep. You may know your, you would know this better than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3371" target="_blank">00:56:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">me, but your spinal fluid and such expands and contracts. The idea of emptying out the garbage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so to speak. Yeah, literally rinses out your system. Yeah. And I like that concept. I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and, you know, to what extent that is beneficial, I'm sure it is. I don't know. And all the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">facts, but even people argue what's better for your REM versus deep sleep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">even some of that is debated by experts in the field. Again, I'm not a sleep expert. I have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tendency to move into fields I know nothing about. So because I'm so naive, I hope to learn something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">especially these areas that aren't so well understood. So it's an area we're going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">studying a lot more around the glucose control. But there's no question, if you look at some people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they're spiking really bizarrely. And I have mixed days myself. I'm trying to sort that out. Somewhere I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hit the party line, higher glucose gradually go down by the morning. But then I have nights where I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">quite irregular. And I want to correlate that with what's going on. And it's not just me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's true of a lot of people. And I don't think that's sorted out in my mind. And I think metabolism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in general, some way we can talk about the micro sampling stuff. But we found that we had 32 people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">drink this Ensure Shake while they were fasted. And they all reacted very differently to it. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">during the day now, not sleep. And for some people, it was pro-inflammatory, for others,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">anti-inflammatory. So interesting. I assume a lot of this got set early in life because your whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">microbiome, so backing up a little bit, just so people realize that, you know, you have a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">microbes. You have, in fact, more microbes in you than our human cells. And they're critical for digesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">your food and all this. And they're, they heavily interact with your immune system. 70% of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">immune cells are in your gut. So you have this whole interplay between your immune system and your gut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, then the food you eat, which goes through your small intestine first, and the small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">molecules like glucose get absorbed. But then all the fibers, the big molecules go into your,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your culinary, your large intestine, where they basically, you know, are interacting with these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">immune cells. So I think a lot, and a lot of that gets probably set early in life. In fact, people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have shown your microbiome gets set in your first three years of life. So I think that interplay all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">gets established. And then you are reacting to some of that, your food later in life. That's at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the postulate. Not that you can't modify it. In fact, you know, switching from carnivore to veggie diets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and there were Mediterranean type diets, which are sort of healthier, like fish heavy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">veggie diets, I think, are helpful for people.

I know it doesn't sound like very many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3982" target="_blank">01:06:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but they did a, what's called a crossover study where they went on increasing doses where they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3986" target="_blank">01:06:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">took either 10 for the first 10 grams a day for the first week as a supplement, 20 the next week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">30 the next week, and then did a washout and then switched to the other one. So they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=3997" target="_blank">01:06:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they're randomized. They might do a arabaziland in the first period and then inulin in the second,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4002" target="_blank">01:06:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">then a mixed fiber, which the party line would say is, is supposed to be the best for you. So we put,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4007" target="_blank">01:06:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we do what we're known for these deep measurements, these deep, we measure as many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">molecules of people's blood and as well as clinical measures. And so what we discovered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is that as a general rule, arabaziland did reduce cholesterol and actually quite substantially. It went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">down about 25%. So this is in metamucil, but what other, um, what sorts of foods contain high amounts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4031" target="_blank">01:07:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of the, of this compound? Most do actually. Oh, okay. So broccoli? Yeah. Broccoli, yeah. Kale, lettuce,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cabbage. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So this is like the, when we think of fiber, we think of... But they have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4042" target="_blank">01:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but they have other things as well. So these are generally mixtures. Like apple fiber will have three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4047" target="_blank">01:07:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">major types of fiber. It's back to this heterogeneity of fibers. So we're now getting into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4052" target="_blank">01:07:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">others like beta glucans, another fiber, resistant starch is yet another one. So there's a whole series</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of these fibers out there, yet they're not studied for their individual effects. And it may be the case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4064" target="_blank">01:07:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, the complex mixture is a big deal, uh, as well, meaning getting the right combination. But we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">starting with individual fibers, trying to see what their effects are. And then we will do a combination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4077" target="_blank">01:07:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're just finishing up a study where same thing, instead of two fibers, we added two more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">beta glucan and resistant starch. And we're trying to see their effects of supplements. Uh, and the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately is, is I think people do supplements. That's why we're doing supplements. Not that I'm a big fan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd rather they, you know, healthier, unprocessed food or both, but yeah, most people don't get enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4100" target="_blank">01:08:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably know that, um, it's recommended women have at least 25 grams of fiber a day, men 35.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And a number of the people get is something like 12 to 15. Wow. They're off by a factor of two in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">their amount of fiber they consume. So, you know, minimally supplements could help bring that up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4120" target="_blank">01:08:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, uh, I mentioned that rhabinozionin as a general, lowered most people's cholesterol. And by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4128" target="_blank">01:08:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">neither affected glucose. So we think other things are important for that. And, um, but if you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4134" target="_blank">01:08:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">individuals, we did see some people where rhabinozionin had zero effect, meaning their cholesterol</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4140" target="_blank">01:09:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">stayed flat, even when they went to the higher dose of 30 grams per day. Yet their inulin promoted their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4148" target="_blank">01:09:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">decrease, uh, decrease, uh, in, in cholesterol. So what's going on? Well, we don't know, but to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's logical that your microbiome, maybe it's your immune, maybe it's other parameters are playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4159" target="_blank">01:09:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">into this. So this is why ultimately what I want to do is just get your microbiome, do a blood draw and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4165" target="_blank">01:09:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">say, aha, here's the foods that will be healthy for you. And here's the ones that won't. I think this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">very personalized and complex. It comes back to what you're saying before about meats and things having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">different effects on people. And you probably know a lot of people with bipolar. Now the, the solution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4182" target="_blank">01:09:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for a lot of people is a ketogenic diet, right? Which, and it seems to really work. There are studies out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4187" target="_blank">01:09:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there where it's been very transformative. Which is remarkable. I mean, if we really just take a step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">back, it's like for ever, you know, bipolar depression was one of the most difficult things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to treat. And it turns out the ketogenic diet can be very effective in some people, in some cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4205" target="_blank">01:10:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">curing people, not every person, but that's a remarkable breakthrough. I agree. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4210" target="_blank">01:10:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and as you said earlier, I think it's such a key, uh, thing for people to keep in mind. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">understand the least about the things we do the most. So you can imagine for many years, people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">eating like every, everyone eats sooner or later. And, um, some of these people are dealing with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4224" target="_blank">01:10:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">serious mental health issues and the foods they were eating very well were exacerbating their symptoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's just wild to think about. But then when we talk about, and I've heard you say, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4235" target="_blank">01:10:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">food is medicine. I think most people don't think of food as medicine. I think most people think as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4241" target="_blank">01:10:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">food is something, uh, they need that they crave, that they enjoy, uh, and that eventually becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4249" target="_blank">01:10:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">problematic for them. You know, I don't think people really understand the extent to which what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4253" target="_blank">01:10:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they put in their mouth can support them, that it really can be health promoting. Yeah. Right. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's because we are so calorie oriented, like, oh, you know, it's all a battle between what you take in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4263" target="_blank">01:11:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">versus what you burn. Yeah. But you really view food as medicine. Oh yeah. Because I think we are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the way I look at it, we're homeostatic systems. We're very, and complex ones at that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We have all these organs, all these biochemical pathways. And, you know, the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4278" target="_blank">01:11:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we also understand at least is people's behavior that came up earlier and I'm sure it will come up again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and you have to tune all this stuff to keep it right. And in general, most people do pretty well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4292" target="_blank">01:11:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think we could, uh, all improve that, I'm sure. And that is the goal. It's to keep this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4298" target="_blank">01:11:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, your car, right? You want, if you want it to run forever, you want to keep all the systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4303" target="_blank">01:11:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">working right and in balance. You don't let things get off too far. And I think there's a tendency,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4308" target="_blank">01:11:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think there's a problem with medicine today. We wait till things are broken and then try and fix it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4313" target="_blank">01:11:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so obviously what you want to do is have people as well-tuned cars for their entire life and then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4320" target="_blank">01:12:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, pass away then. That's how it should work. Uh, and so I think that's what we want to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4327" target="_blank">01:12:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">keep people tuned.

So we set up, it comes from my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4900" target="_blank">01:21:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">philosophy that I think, you know, medicine is broken. We tend to do sick care rather than health care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4905" target="_blank">01:21:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we started when I moved to Stanford now 16 years ago, this idea, maybe we should, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4912" target="_blank">01:21:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't measure people very much when they're healthy. You don't measure them very often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4916" target="_blank">01:21:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So just, you know, it started with me, but the goal was to do a bigger group, which we did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4921" target="_blank">01:22:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">profiling people, collecting as much data as possible while they're healthy. So we, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">people would get blood, their microbiome, all urine, and we would take these and do what's called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4934" target="_blank">01:22:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">omics measurement. We'd make as many measurements from their blood as possible on top of deep clinical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4940" target="_blank">01:22:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">measurements, using all these new tools. And we would do it every three months and we do it while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4946" target="_blank">01:22:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they're healthy. If they got ill, like from a viral infection, things like that, we would take more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4951" target="_blank">01:22:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">samples to be able to collect more carefully to see what was going on when they first got ill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4956" target="_blank">01:22:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've been running this study on me now for about 15 and a half years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4964" target="_blank">01:22:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And for this group of people about almost 12 and a half years. So we've been profiling this group of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4970" target="_blank">01:22:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people. Some have dropped off by now, because it takes a lot of energy to be part of one of these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4976" target="_blank">01:22:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that particular study. But anyway, others have come in. And so, yeah, we've been running this for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4982" target="_blank">01:23:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">some time. And the idea is to see what a healthy profile looks like. How does it change over time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4987" target="_blank">01:23:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which we interpret as aging? You know, what happens when people first get ill? And we're very enamored</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">by these technologies. In fact, we invented some of them, our lab did, for these omics technologies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=4999" target="_blank">01:23:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like something called RNA-seq, where we can measure all your transcripts. And we have ways of following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5007" target="_blank">01:23:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">all your proteins with protein chips and things like that. So our lab did invent a lot of these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5012" target="_blank">01:23:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they're called the omics technologies. So it's ways of collecting big data from, again, your blood, your urine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5018" target="_blank">01:23:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and even your microbiome. And so we basically sequenced people's genome, made all these measurements,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5025" target="_blank">01:23:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and followed them over time. Well, I was going to say, we were also curious whether we could use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5030" target="_blank">01:23:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">some of these technologies, like genome sequencing, and, you know, this method for measuring transcripts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5037" target="_blank">01:23:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are any seeking things for better, you know, maybe managing people's health. And then we brought in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5043" target="_blank">01:24:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the wearables when they were first fitness trackers. We thought, well, maybe they're a little more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5047" target="_blank">01:24:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting than just fitness trackers. So we put them on for health monitoring. And I can tell when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5053" target="_blank">01:24:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">started, it was a bit controversial at the time. A lot of the physicians are not like sequencing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5057" target="_blank">01:24:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">genomes of healthy people. This shows when we, it was right after genome sequencing was first coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5062" target="_blank">01:24:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, they were worried we were going to turn everybody into hypochondriac. It's going to cost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5068" target="_blank">01:24:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">millions of dollars. And most people have warmed up to it now, not a hundred percent. A lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5072" target="_blank">01:24:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">still don't like that. They still don't like the wearables. I'm sure we'll talk about that. But anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we did show that a lot of people learned some pretty important things from their genome. One young guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5082" target="_blank">01:24:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">turned out he had a mutational heart gene and his father died right around the time we sequenced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5087" target="_blank">01:24:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">his genome. His father died of a heart problem. And sure enough, he has a heart defect that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5093" target="_blank">01:24:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">uncovered by his genome sequence. So we had examples like that. And then same with the wearables uncovered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5099" target="_blank">01:24:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">things. All kinds of things popped up. Actually, 49 people had what we would call major health discovery</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5105" target="_blank">01:25:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just in the first three and a half years of running the study and somewhere with the wearables, with all kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5111" target="_blank">01:25:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">things. That was the thing. It was no one technology. What we're doing is we're getting a much more complete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5116" target="_blank">01:25:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">picture of people's health. And we discovered these things then before they have symptoms. So we're profiling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5121" target="_blank">01:25:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">people while they're healthy. And we're looking for things that might be off. And so the way I like the analogy I like to use is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if your health is a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle, the way when you go to a physician's office today, we would say they measure five or six of those thousand pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5140" target="_blank">01:25:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They just don't get a very good picture.

So they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5416" target="_blank">01:30:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">took it out and things seemed fine. Then they did a whole body MRI follow up later and they found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5422" target="_blank">01:30:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">three more nodules. So the question is, were they there to begin with or had his tumor metastasized?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5430" target="_blank">01:30:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">No way to know.

And a good example is if you go to a physician today and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5573" target="_blank">01:32:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your glucose is high and it's normally been low and it might spike up, they'll say, well, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5578" target="_blank">01:32:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have you, were you ill yesterday or something like that?

And yeah, and that might have been a clue for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5590" target="_blank">01:33:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something big. And we've seen that in our study. We'll see somebody who shifted off their liver enzymes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5596" target="_blank">01:33:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and they'll come to me and say, Mike, I'm still in the normal range even. You know, they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5600" target="_blank">01:33:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they're, and this is why we're big on baselines. That's a big theme in our work. No way your healthy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5605" target="_blank">01:33:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">baseline is like the MRIs.

So I think the trajectories of these measurements is key. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5627" target="_blank">01:33:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing how you're progressing is a big deal.

Let's talk about some of the sensors you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5652" target="_blank">01:34:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wearing and what people can monitor now. You talked about continuous glucose monitors, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5660" target="_blank">01:34:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">non-invasive. I mean, you don't even feel it going in. It's just basically a sticker thing. But what are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5666" target="_blank">01:34:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the other things? Most people are familiar now with sleep tracking. And of course, that's pulling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5673" target="_blank">01:34:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">heart rate data and a few other things. But yeah, walk us through what's possible now with non-invasive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5678" target="_blank">01:34:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">trackers. And maybe let us know which particular ones you're wearing. This isn't a promotion of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5686" target="_blank">01:34:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">particular products. I'm just very curious. You're armed to the teeth with sensors here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5691" target="_blank">01:34:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do you got? Yeah, I'm a big measurement guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5694" target="_blank">01:34:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, you're a Stanford faculty after all. So I have my, this is my Fitbit. This is my Apple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5702" target="_blank">01:35:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Watch. And then I happen to have a company that's called Sensomics that has two different, this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5706" target="_blank">01:35:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">new one they have out, and then the older one. And so they all measure heart rate, heart rate variability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5713" target="_blank">01:35:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and reasonably accurate, meaning, you know, not that far off. And so, again, for the listeners,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5720" target="_blank">01:35:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">resting heart rate, everybody knows. But heart rate variability is an important measurement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5724" target="_blank">01:35:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">more and more appreciated these days. When you're ill, your variability drops. And both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5730" target="_blank">01:35:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">those are fairly accurate these days for most devices. Oh, and I have a ring. This one happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5735" target="_blank">01:35:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to be a circle. I used to wear an aura ring. It's not an aura ring? Which one is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5740" target="_blank">01:35:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called circle. They have their different parameters. So there's no right or wrong to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5746" target="_blank">01:35:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You have the same thing. You have to match it to your lifestyle.

So you have to find the one that works best for you. I do think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5761" target="_blank">01:36:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">wearing them overnight, it's a great time for health monitoring.

Some measure blood oxygen. Some of that's accurate. Some it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5770" target="_blank">01:36:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">accurate. Depends on the device. Some measure skin temperature. Again, some of that's accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5777" target="_blank">01:36:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Some it's not. Depends on the device. They also measure something called galvanic stress response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5782" target="_blank">01:36:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Some do. That's conductance on your skin. And that is not something we normally measure in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5788" target="_blank">01:36:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">doctor's office. But it turns out it has value for hydration. Because when you have dryers, like when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5793" target="_blank">01:36:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you're diabetic, you'll have drier skin. And I should have figured this out earlier when I first became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5798" target="_blank">01:36:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">diabetic, I got itchy because my skin got dry. Anyway, you can measure that with your smartwatch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5804" target="_blank">01:36:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and get that in real time. The galvanic skin response. Yeah. And also as a measure of stress,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5810" target="_blank">01:36:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're stressed, you sweat more. And so you can pick that up as well with these devices. So there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5816" target="_blank">01:36:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">fair number of things. And then some of them you can measure, you know, an EKG and sleep, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5822" target="_blank">01:37:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">super important. Their accuracy for the stages is still questionable. It depends on the device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5828" target="_blank">01:37:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They're getting better though. I use an eight sleep.

Okay. Because I'm doing an experiment on myself where I measure my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5842" target="_blank">01:37:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">subjective feelings of rest and alertness and energy and compare it to the data. And the only way to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5849" target="_blank">01:37:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that properly is to not glance at the data first thing in the morning. Okay. Right. Because it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5853" target="_blank">01:37:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">biases how you feel. Our colleague, Ali Crum at Stanford has done some nice experiments where they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5858" target="_blank">01:37:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tell people after a genuinely poor night's sleep, they got a great sleep, or they tell people after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5864" target="_blank">01:37:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a great night's sleep, they got poor sleep and they show them a sleep score and they give them some data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5868" target="_blank">01:37:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's false data basically. And people's levels of alertness, wellbeing, et cetera, are strongly biased</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5876" target="_blank">01:37:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">by what they are told their sleep was like, as opposed to what it was actually like. This is a big deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5883" target="_blank">01:38:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And I think speaks to all the beautiful studies that Ali's done because she finds stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5887" target="_blank">01:38:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like this all the time. Right. And nutrition and wellbeing and these mindset effects are really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5892" target="_blank">01:38:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful. So I look at my sleep data maybe once every two or three days. Right. And I'm constantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5898" target="_blank">01:38:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">striving to get more REM sleep. By the way, warming your sleeping environment in the last two hours of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5904" target="_blank">01:38:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sleep will dramatically increase the amount of REM sleep you get. I learned that trick from Matt Walker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5908" target="_blank">01:38:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and it works spectacularly well. I'll have to give it a try. Yeah. Matt taught me that trick and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5913" target="_blank">01:38:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">getting close to two and a half hours of REM sleep now. Wow. And I only sleep about six and a half,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5918" target="_blank">01:38:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">seven hours to feel rested. Nice. So it's pretty spectacular. And I think I got it. I got to try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5923" target="_blank">01:38:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I thank Matt for that tip. It's one of my biggest weaknesses. I don't sleep that well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5927" target="_blank">01:38:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

The night and then the opposite toward morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.

That is so cool. I now emerge from sleep feeling so much better. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5939" target="_blank">01:38:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless I was having a disturbing dream, in which case you got to like go think about something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5944" target="_blank">01:39:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But in any case, the sleep trackers, right, on the eight sleep, because the tracker is stationary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5952" target="_blank">01:39:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's fixed to the mattress. My understanding is that it's more accurate than if the tracker is on a limb</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5959" target="_blank">01:39:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">where you could be moving, because that will disrupt sleep stage measurement.

Yeah. So what about HRV? We're hearing more and more that HRV is perhaps even more interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5975" target="_blank">01:39:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">than resting heart rate. I think it probably is. What are some things that we can do to improve our HRV?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5982" target="_blank">01:39:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What should our HRV be?

Again, I'm not a cardiologist. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=5993" target="_blank">01:39:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">not an expert there.

I've noticed that. That makes sense. Recently, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6006" target="_blank">01:40:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of these AI programs, again, happens to come from January.

And I think I'm sleeping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6022" target="_blank">01:40:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">better actually.

I need to get back to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6047" target="_blank">01:40:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for sure.

That was some years ago. And then, of course, Brian Johnson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6438" target="_blank">01:47:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">likes to boast his biological age.

But here, you're talking about something distinctly different. You're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6470" target="_blank">01:47:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about the progression of aging of different organs or different organ systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6475" target="_blank">01:47:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the Horvath clocks are correct, meaning they do measure biological age. But the problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6481" target="_blank">01:48:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is it's not actionable. What do you do? Your methylation pattern, that's a modification of DNA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6487" target="_blank">01:48:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">has shifted, and it gives you an overall value. Well, what do you do with that? You don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6494" target="_blank">01:48:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you wouldn't – yeah. And they can predict something called grim age these days, your time to death,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6499" target="_blank">01:48:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your mortality. Oh, nice. Same thing. I mean, what are you going to do with that? What's special about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6505" target="_blank">01:48:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">age of types is that they're breaking it down. And so they say, all right, your immune age is off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6511" target="_blank">01:48:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can do X. Your oxidative stress is off, you do Y. So it's basically actionable information. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6521" target="_blank">01:48:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">think it makes all the difference. And conceptually, it makes a lot of sense, too. It's like your car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6526" target="_blank">01:48:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I know I keep coming back to that analogy.

And ideally, you'd catch it before they break. And I think that's how we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6543" target="_blank">01:49:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of age of types. You can go in. And so I mentioned this company earlier. Iola, what they do is they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6549" target="_blank">01:49:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tracking your age of types because they're doing these deep metabolic profiles. And they actually make,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6556" target="_blank">01:49:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they use AI, they pull in things and make very specific recommendations. And then you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6562" target="_blank">01:49:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, they'll tell you exact foods to eat and things like that. And 95% of people improve their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6569" target="_blank">01:49:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">markers.

And generally, they tend to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6681" target="_blank">01:51:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">towards the Mediterranean vegan kind of diet.

And then they tend to have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6700" target="_blank">01:51:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they're fairly active, meaning, but their form of activity can vary.

My</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6713" target="_blank">01:51:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">prediction is they probably sleep pretty well, too.

And so, the thought is that I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6804" target="_blank">01:53:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">genetically at risk, and then in combination with this viral infection, this environmental, that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=6810" target="_blank">01:53:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">triggered my diabetes.

So there were seven genes known, and we wound up finding 690 genes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7206" target="_blank">02:00:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's true with these new AI methods we have for analyzing genomes.

But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7219" target="_blank">02:00:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there still is no cure for ALS.

So I'm intrigued by things that one could potentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7378" target="_blank">02:02:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">do to protect neurons, aside from wearing a bike helmet, which I'm relieved to hear that you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7384" target="_blank">02:03:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. In any case, uh, room for further exploration. Yeah. Of course there's motor neurons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7388" target="_blank">02:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for ALS. Right. Motor neurons for ALS. So I don't know how similar or different, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7394" target="_blank">02:03:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's super interesting.

Yeah. And it's, yeah, not good. So anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7580" target="_blank">02:06:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the, um, and these days, as you know, plastics and microplastics have, have erupted as a, as a pretty big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7588" target="_blank">02:06:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">health concern, but nobody's a hundred percent sure what it means, but they do know now that when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7594" target="_blank">02:06:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you dissect people's brains of folks who have died and you'll see microplastics and they're everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7599" target="_blank">02:06:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so what is it doing to your health? I don't think we fully know, but we're starting by just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7607" target="_blank">02:06:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to measure this stuff. So we've decided to start with airborne, but you could argue, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7612" target="_blank">02:06:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what are you drinking?

Uh, and, and so what we're doing here, it's not just measuring PM 2.5 and PM 10. It's basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7626" target="_blank">02:07:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">um, there's, it's, uh, it's sucking up air. There's a pump in here and underneath the intake valve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7633" target="_blank">02:07:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a filter that captures all the particulates like pollen, bacteria, fungi, and under that there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7640" target="_blank">02:07:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a chemical absorbent.

And then we try and correlate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7671" target="_blank">02:07:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what's outside with what's inside, because we'll measure your blood as well with these deep profiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7678" target="_blank">02:07:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we've discovered is, first of all, they're, you know, you'll be getting exposed to we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7683" target="_blank">02:08:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we, for me, I'll do one of these during the week, one on the weekend. So it's not, we don't do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7688" target="_blank">02:08:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">every five minutes kind of thing, because you have to collect enough sample. But we will basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7693" target="_blank">02:08:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">determine, you know, what kind of exposure you're getting. And, and if you're at high risk for certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7700" target="_blank">02:08:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">things, you may want to know this, like asthma or allergies, what are you exposed? And there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7704" target="_blank">02:08:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I can give you an example. I used to have moderate allergies. Now they're pretty mild, but because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7710" target="_blank">02:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">allergies can fluctuate a bit. And they would come every spring, I just assumed it was pollen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7716" target="_blank">02:08:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but what is pollen in the end, but I assumed it was pine. But when we did the correlation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7723" target="_blank">02:08:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well, it turns out it correlates better with eucalyptus. And then it's like, duh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7729" target="_blank">02:08:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I should have realized this, but I don't get them on the northeast where there's no eucalyptus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7735" target="_blank">02:08:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the end, it makes a lot of sense. So that one hasn't affected my lifestyle, meaning I still have a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7743" target="_blank">02:09:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">eucalyptus tree out back that I've not chopped down.

But yeah, at least I know what's going on. But then like on the chemical side, which is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7758" target="_blank">02:09:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting, we discover there's DEET everywhere, even in my office at Stanford DEET.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7764" target="_blank">02:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The insect repellent, the carcinogenic insect repellent. I used it years ago when I was a camp</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7770" target="_blank">02:09:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">counselor. And then one day someone said, someone on the maintenance staff said, take some DEET,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7775" target="_blank">02:09:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">put it into a Ziploc bag and put that Ziploc bag into a glass jar. And I was like, okay. And I did that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7784" target="_blank">02:09:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And within a few hours, the plastic bag was completely disintegrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7789" target="_blank">02:09:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Ouch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7790" target="_blank">02:09:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was slathering that stuff on my skin way back when. And I lived with mosquito bites for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7795" target="_blank">02:09:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the rest of the summer. I'm like, I'm not putting this stuff on my skin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7798" target="_blank">02:09:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, of course, I had to worry about getting West Nile or something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7801" target="_blank">02:10:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Not in Yosemite. You had to worry about getting Giardia, but that's a different issue from the water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7807" target="_blank">02:10:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. And same with pesticides in most places. And carcinogens, of course, are everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7816" target="_blank">02:10:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But their types vary. And the amounts vary a lot. So like when I'm in UC Davis giving talks or something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7823" target="_blank">02:10:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I get a pesticide exposure because all the fields are out there. Yeah. And same with when I was in Fresno.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7829" target="_blank">02:10:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see these correlations. And so that's what we're doing. We'll measure what's where.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7836" target="_blank">02:10:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'll measure how does that relate to what's going on inside. So we can see what microbes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7842" target="_blank">02:10:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">are outside relating to inflammation markers like cytokines, things like that on the inside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7848" target="_blank">02:10:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And same with some of the chemical markers like your glucose levels. And right now that's mostly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7855" target="_blank">02:10:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">been built as models around me. But we're trying to run the study with a lot of people. So we can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7861" target="_blank">02:11:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">first of all, even break it down further. What's the difference between your kitchen and your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7865" target="_blank">02:11:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">living room and outside your house? And the same thing, how does that relate to some of the levels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7871" target="_blank">02:11:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of key markers, your metabolites, your inflammatory markers? So we want to correlate that. We know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7879" target="_blank">02:11:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">studies from others have shown pesticides correlate with Parkinson's and things like this. So we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7886" target="_blank">02:11:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">see what's going on there. I can tell you some fun stuff that we just made. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7891" target="_blank">02:11:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">these are all correlations. Now we do something called mediation analysis. It can let you get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7896" target="_blank">02:11:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">little better about causality. Not proof in many cases, but a better idea. Anyway, here's a fun thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7903" target="_blank">02:11:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we discovered. We found a correlation between something called pyridine, which used to be common in paints,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7911" target="_blank">02:11:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's in other places too. They've recently don't put it in paints, but pyridine exposures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7917" target="_blank">02:11:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are associated with lack of fungi, meaning I'll have a more bacterial plant or other exposure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7922" target="_blank">02:12:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So my house was painted by a green guy, no pyridine in the paints there. So I get a fungal exposure when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7929" target="_blank">02:12:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm at home. And so is that good or bad? I don't know. But imagine I was very allergic to black molds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7935" target="_blank">02:12:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe I do want pyridine in my plate. I know a lot of people who struggle with mold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7941" target="_blank">02:12:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We can make that association with the allergies, of course. Anyway, you get the idea. We're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7945" target="_blank">02:12:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">correlate what's going on in the outside with the inside. Well, in that case, with other outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7951" target="_blank">02:12:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">things, but later with the inside. So yeah, we're measuring to make these things. That'll lead to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7957" target="_blank">02:12:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">hypotheses that we could then probably test by either mouse models or in humans who live in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7965" target="_blank">02:12:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">certain places who wind up sort of testing whether they're trying to or not. Imagine you live near,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7970" target="_blank">02:12:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, obviously you live near certain areas, you will see if you live near, you know, mines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=7977" target="_blank">02:12:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see autoimmune disease, things like that.

It's a shame it took that.

Two Stanford faculty talking about measuring lots of biomarkers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8111" target="_blank">02:15:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from a single drop of blood, screams of Theranos.

However, that was some years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8130" target="_blank">02:15:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and you were not involved with that. And so the technology has now evolved to the point where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8135" target="_blank">02:15:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">my understanding is that you are able to measure lots of biomarkers from a single drop of blood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8141" target="_blank">02:15:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.

I guess if there might be a subset of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8150" target="_blank">02:15:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">people. But so tell us about that. What is that pursuit called? What are you measuring? Why are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8158" target="_blank">02:15:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">measuring it?

I think that's a barrier to getting measured. So can we come up with more, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8180" target="_blank">02:16:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">facile ways of measuring people? The wearables are obviously one and they're perfect because they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8186" target="_blank">02:16:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, passive monitoring and continuous. So you're really collecting a lot of data just in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8191" target="_blank">02:16:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the background. I mean, the inconvenience is wearing and charging these things. But we don't measure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8198" target="_blank">02:16:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what's on the inside. And I think that still has value. And the idea about trying to set up home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8204" target="_blank">02:16:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">tests for this sort of thing, I think is powerful. So that was the motivation. That was the motivation for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8210" target="_blank">02:16:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Theranos, I think, too. And our, you know, shtick, if you will, was to try and do this. But we're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8219" target="_blank">02:16:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to measure the exact clinical values because some of that is hard. How do you measure LDL droplets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8226" target="_blank">02:17:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in micro samples? It's probably doable, but it's a lot trickier. We were just trying to, it fits with our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8233" target="_blank">02:17:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of doing deep data profiles on little drops of blood. And the key is to find a format that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8239" target="_blank">02:17:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">keep the analytes, as we call them, the molecules stable. And so we test them. We spent seven years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8246" target="_blank">02:17:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">actually trying different things, finding formats. The old format was to use paper, actually, cellulose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8252" target="_blank">02:17:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to collect the stuff. And that doesn't work very well. The analytes oxidize. It's a mess. And so ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8259" target="_blank">02:17:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we test a lot of things out there. We were trying to invent a few of our own. And the net result was we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8265" target="_blank">02:17:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we did settle on some that were out there, tested them. They're being used in a more limited fashion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8270" target="_blank">02:17:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we showed you could actually do the kinds of things we do. The metabolomics is called lipidomics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8275" target="_blank">02:17:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And proteomics. And again, with certain configurations, the proteins turn, most of them are quite stable. Not 100%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8284" target="_blank">02:18:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but most are. We can measure all this. Metabolites, same thing. Most are lipids. Some are, some aren't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8290" target="_blank">02:18:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we figured out which ones are, which ones aren't. And then we basically did just that. We showed you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8297" target="_blank">02:18:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">could do this, did fun experiments. Like in my case, we took a sample every hour for seven straight days</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8304" target="_blank">02:18:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to try and correlate. Around the clock? Well, at night when I was sleeping, no. But although when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8310" target="_blank">02:18:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">did wake up, I would take a sample sometimes, yeah. Well, it's just a drop. Yeah, not so great for sleep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8317" target="_blank">02:18:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">disruption, I suppose. But anyway, and the idea there was a correlate, you know, what's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8323" target="_blank">02:18:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with, and I was wearing a CGM and a smartwatch. I could follow activity, doing food logging, all that sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8329" target="_blank">02:18:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of stuff. And in the end, we're trying to correlate basically people's activities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8336" target="_blank">02:18:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">people's biochemistry and physiology with their activities and heart rate and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8342" target="_blank">02:19:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we found literally thousands of correlations. That's pretty cool. A lot of which is known, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8348" target="_blank">02:19:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">After your insulin goes up after your glucose.

People use it a lot for pain and apparently for fertility and other things as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8523" target="_blank">02:22:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's shown to be effective in a number of domains and I've had quote-unquote standard MDs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8528" target="_blank">02:22:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">including our director of pain medicine, Sean Mackey on this podcast, who's like, yep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8532" target="_blank">02:22:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there is evidence acupuncture can work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8533" target="_blank">02:22:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are plenty of people swear by it and she uses it for blood pressure, okay, for blood pressure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8541" target="_blank">02:22:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">management. So I run a little high on the blood pressure. Not, nobody's overly panicked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8548" target="_blank">02:22:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but you know, I tend to be in the high 130s, but I guess because it's getting a very large grain out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8555" target="_blank">02:22:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I was in the low 140s. And so I measured myself right before acupuncture, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8561" target="_blank">02:22:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">very specific time of day with my monitor at home. And yeah, I was running 140 over the low 80s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8568" target="_blank">02:22:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something like 82, 83, did, you know, five measurements. So did the acupuncture, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8574" target="_blank">02:22:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">designed for blood pressure and diabetes. And maybe I can go off the GLPs if all this works. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8580" target="_blank">02:23:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">anyway, the next day I measured at the exact same time and son of a gun, it was 25 points lower as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8586" target="_blank">02:23:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">high teens, like 118. It was unbelievable. I can show you the data. And the other one went to like 72,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8594" target="_blank">02:23:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Some, the diastolic. So I just, with one treatment, that was electroactive puncture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8601" target="_blank">02:23:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I should say. So they zap you. And they, yeah, had 30 some points and, and they've added a few more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8608" target="_blank">02:23:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">since. So you do it every week for eight weeks. So I've now done four of these things. And I can tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8614" target="_blank">02:23:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you that my blood pressure stayed low. It's running in this one high one teens, maybe 120,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8622" target="_blank">02:23:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which is pretty good, roughly where you want to be. And the other is always around maybe 74. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8628" target="_blank">02:23:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, it was never running like that before. I can show you my data. It's great. It's pretty incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8634" target="_blank">02:23:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So it does seem to be working now. How long does it last? I'm only halfway through my treatments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8638" target="_blank">02:23:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, but I will track all this stuff. Right. So I'm a responder, no question to this treatment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8646" target="_blank">02:24:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I love hearing it. I haven't done acupuncture in years. So it's, and I've done it. Yeah. Years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8651" target="_blank">02:24:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when I was a postdoc, a stressful time in my life, and then a junior professor, also a stressful time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8656" target="_blank">02:24:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in my life, you know, a lot of uncertainty, right? And grants and things of that sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8659" target="_blank">02:24:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">My sister suggested I go see a acupuncturist and I got a lot out of it in terms of stress reduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8668" target="_blank">02:24:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll put a link to it in the show note captions, but I'll also send you these papers from Chufu Ma's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8672" target="_blank">02:24:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">lab that I mentioned a few months ago. Yeah. First of all, not that this means everything, but published as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8677" target="_blank">02:24:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">articles and letters in nature, which has a very high bar for, you know, most papers get rejected,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8685" target="_blank">02:24:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, as you know. And what they found is interesting that the combination of needle placements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8691" target="_blank">02:24:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">turns out to be vitally important. So in this one paper that Chufu has, he shows that, for instance, if the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8696" target="_blank">02:24:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if the needles are inserted into like the equivalent of like the palm area and the foot area and some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8703" target="_blank">02:25:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">flank area, you get an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Whereas if you change that combination,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8709" target="_blank">02:25:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you get a decrease in inflammatory cytokines. But what's really beautiful about these papers is he maps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8713" target="_blank">02:25:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it to specific output from the spleen, regulated by the vagus nerve, regulated by the these receptors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8722" target="_blank">02:25:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">at the level of the skin. So mechanistically, it all makes sense. It's just that these thousands of years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8727" target="_blank">02:25:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of charts and data that have been collected in humans, you know, clinical practice has never been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8734" target="_blank">02:25:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">parsed mechanistically. Right. So I'm 100% a believer that there's a mechanistic basis that it's not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8739" target="_blank">02:25:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">all placebo. Some of it might be placebo, much like some of the GLP appetite suppression might be placebo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8746" target="_blank">02:25:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but a lot of it probably isn't. So in any case, I'm a fan of the rigorous exploration of things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8754" target="_blank">02:25:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have been thought to work for many, many years. And it's always gratifying when you see, oh, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8758" target="_blank">02:25:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">here's a mechanism. Yeah, it really does work. I mean, I go into the stuff completely open. It may not work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8764" target="_blank">02:26:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know, I didn't even, and she said, oh, because first of all, she said, well, just try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8769" target="_blank">02:26:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">acupuncture. I wasn't even sure what kind she was going to try. So in the end, she said, oh, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8774" target="_blank">02:26:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll do blood pressure and diabetes. Now they've added on some stress points as well. And I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8780" target="_blank">02:26:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">consider myself probably in a high stress job, but I don't consider myself a very stressful person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8785" target="_blank">02:26:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't seem stressed.

I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8796" target="_blank">02:26:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">know. But the data, I mean, that was a pretty big jump, right? Speaking of fun and things that are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8803" target="_blank">02:26:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">at least on the face of them, kind of out there, I have one final question, which is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8809" target="_blank">02:26:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">my understanding is a few years ago, your laboratory was involved in looking at big data sets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8816" target="_blank">02:26:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">genomics, proteomics, etc., from people who had attended a Tony Robbins event. I don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8823" target="_blank">02:27:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the control condition was. And I only know this because I believe it was a postdoc or a student</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8828" target="_blank">02:27:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in your lab had reached out about some protocols that we had going in my lab in collaboration with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8834" target="_blank">02:27:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the psychiatry department. Could you describe the contour of this study? And I realize it's not published</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8841" target="_blank">02:27:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">yet, but if there were any preliminary findings that you could share with us, I think that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8845" target="_blank">02:27:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">be interesting. I'm interested generally in immersive events and psychological health. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8852" target="_blank">02:27:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there are interesting data comparing attendance of these events, which by the way, I have no financial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8857" target="_blank">02:27:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship to, never met Tony in person or anything like that, with prescription antidepressant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8862" target="_blank">02:27:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">treatments. And they actually measure up pretty well in terms of, I forget how long-term the study was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8867" target="_blank">02:27:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm generally an open person when it comes to ideas. What was the study and what did you find?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8872" target="_blank">02:27:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe to put it in context, so this all started when a postdoc joined my lab, was very interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8878" target="_blank">02:27:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in mental health and knowing that we're good at measurements and the idea. And I thought about a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8884" target="_blank">02:28:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I realized that we don't measure mental health very well, right? Surveys are still the gold standards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8890" target="_blank">02:28:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for most things. And so how do you know if you're getting better? You do more surveys? That whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8895" target="_blank">02:28:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">concept is very unsatisfying to me. So we thought with the wearables, right? There's got to be a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8902" target="_blank">02:28:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">physiology around this thing. This biochemistry, we do a lot of micro sampling, mentioned earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8908" target="_blank">02:28:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can now profile deeply. So we thought we could bring this kind of stuff maybe. And we're still,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8913" target="_blank">02:28:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a growing area in the lab. I'm very interested in this because I feel like there's a lot going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8919" target="_blank">02:28:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the mental health space. It's just unexplored. And the biggest problem is we just don't have good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8924" target="_blank">02:28:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">biomarkers. And for the meetings I've been at for this stuff, that keeps popping up number one. We don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8930" target="_blank">02:28:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have good biomarkers. So we think the digital, meaning from the wearables, the micro sampling could ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8938" target="_blank">02:28:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">prove to give us good biomarkers. We're already seeing some evidence of that now. So we ran several</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8944" target="_blank">02:29:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">studies. We did one with Byron Katie, who runs one of these immersive programs. And I don't know any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8950" target="_blank">02:29:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about this stuff. And so I basically said, all right, we're going to do this. Let's bring in first. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8955" target="_blank">02:29:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">brought a colleague, George Slavich, who you may or may not know. He's basically an average childhood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8961" target="_blank">02:29:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but knows a lot more than I do about the childhood. And I met him. He's a very, very bright guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8966" target="_blank">02:29:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So he, you know, we came up with some surveys because we have to compare up against something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8971" target="_blank">02:29:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We put smartwatches. The one on Byron Katie didn't quite work out, but we did do blood sampling and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8977" target="_blank">02:29:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff for her and even microbiome for people before and after. And that case, it went out for a way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8983" target="_blank">02:29:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we, so we ran that study. And then shortly thereafter, we ran a pilot one with Tony Robbins,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8990" target="_blank">02:29:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">where we had a smallish number of people who did the Tony Robbins, and we profiled them, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=8997" target="_blank">02:29:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">before, right before, immediately after. And then at that point, I think that study was done out for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9006" target="_blank">02:30:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">several months. And then I'll tell you about the larger one in a minute. And so we had them do these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9013" target="_blank">02:30:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">surveys and things. And, and I went in, I have no idea if this stuff works or not. And son of a gun,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9020" target="_blank">02:30:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">these people really did improve by these questionnaires, by the standards in the field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9025" target="_blank">02:30:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, basically they improve their markers, their mental health, their mental health.

We did do all the surveys and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9145" target="_blank">02:32:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have a battery of wellness surveys.

So we actually did the micro sampling. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9206" target="_blank">02:33:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned earlier where they gave samples before for not everybody, not everybody signed up for that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9211" target="_blank">02:33:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's like 130, 140 people who did the micro sampling before the, you know, immediately after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9218" target="_blank">02:33:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">each of those same time points.

And it is significant. So I'm sure we'll put the paper up on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9240" target="_blank">02:34:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">either bio archive, which is this preprint thing, uh, or can even send your copy.

It's pretty amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9254" target="_blank">02:34:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually.

It's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9261" target="_blank">02:34:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of worked out half and half, uh, and their values all improved, not again, not a hundred percent, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjAvD-U5so0&t=9268" target="_blank">02:34:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty darn, most of them that sort of surprised me.
