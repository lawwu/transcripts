And it's not about like that. I'm all bad. It's just to note it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to, to, to recognize who I am. If I don't know where I'm starting, I can't know, just like finding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">directions.

I'm not, I'm going to be disoriented. I'm going to feel lost. I got to, it starts with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">really knowing where I am, who, and who, and what I am. And from there, then we can start to build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">life. So one of the things I give people a lot is once they kind of understand these assets and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and liabilities of theirs, you know, to, to look at each day ahead and say, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">first we start off with gratitude, you know, it kind of gives a mindset and gratitude just isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">about being thankful for things. I really believe gratitude is meeting what is, as it is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that, uh, I always, when I give people this and when I practice it myself, I try at least to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the things I'm grateful for to be something that I'm challenged by. And not just to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to learn a lesson from this, but I might not know what that is, but to really express</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">gratitude for some challenge I'm, I'm, I'm having. So that's kind of a mindset. And then the next thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is just laying out your plans for the day and, and not like a detailed calendar, but like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to wait, you know, take the kids to school, go to work, travel, you know, have a business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">dinner tonight. Right. And then, so I kind of know what's happening that day. And then from there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MOkiLZPk&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">look at what are my, what's my emotional state currently?
