No, I want you to ask someone to tell me why. Someone asked, "Are you aware of the Never Swing the Rock memes about you?" No, I'm aware of the little Michael "Never Swing the Rock" Porter Jr. I don't know who came up with that.</p><p>But to be completely honest, getting a lot of assists is not my role on the Nuggets. You know what I mean? Joker and Jamal, they play their two-man game. If it gets swung out to me by one of those guys, I'm expected to shoot it. I'm one of the best shooters in the league, like, humbly, like, I can say that.</p><p>But, like, I don't see contests. So, a lot, you might be watching on TV and see me shoot a contested shot, but it doesn't feel contested to me. I might watch it, like, after I'm filming, like, "Yo, I shot that." But really, they don't feel contested. But I'm, I'm, I definitely, I see it, but really, I'm not, I'm not the one with the ball in my hands like I was in high school, you know.</p><p>To win a championship, every player on a team has to have a specific role. And for me, it's like when, when I, when I catch the ball, it's, it's, it's let it fly,</p></div></div></body></html>
