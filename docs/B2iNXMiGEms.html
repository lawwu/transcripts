whether you're talking about colonialism over the last few hundred years, or even you talk about a microcosm like Afghanistan over the last 20 years, I would argue that there's three phases to the West's interaction with these other countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.520</a></span> | <span

domination, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like Jamath was

where the culture that's been dominated realizes that they're behind and they want to catch up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a process of Americanization, Romanization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they're doing is they are learning from us and taking our technology, and it lulls us into a false sense of security that we think they're becoming Americanized or becoming Westernized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's alignment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the third phase is reassertion, where the dominated country, culture, you know, what have you, reasserts its traditional culture and its traditional views because they've modernized, but without becoming truly becoming Americanized or Westernized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we are caught off guard by that.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:36:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what they've actually done is use this period to basically assimilate and catch up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reality is, like in Afghanistan, they don't have to fully assimilate all of our technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iNXMiGEms&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't have to
