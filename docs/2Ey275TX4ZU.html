Obviously, LLM is super exciting. It's been crazy over the past year and a half,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but there has been a question around what all can they do and when do you need to use RAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and when do you not?

All that said, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to make useful applications with these LLMs, then the reality is that without context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there's only so much you can do with the LLM. That's where RAG comes in. RAG stands for retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">augmented generation. I'm sure this is old hat to most of you, but we're just going to go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly. What this means is that you take a generic AI or ML model that, you know, today we're generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about LLMs, but it has a training cutoff, it's missing your private data, maybe it hallucinates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe it doesn't, but overall it's not personalized. And you take your data, right, and you augment it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">at the time of prompting to give it the context that it needs to answer the questions that you want it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">for the use cases that you're bringing it to bear for. And so that could be company-specific data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it could be product info, it could be order history, anything that you're storing inside of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">application database that's already powering kind of your in-app experiences. And with that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you get a transformative AI-powered application, right, that's going to be refined and consistent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and accurate in the responses that it gives when you're prompting the models. So the typical RAG that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you've all probably seen and in most cases probably implemented will look something like this, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">so you have a user that enters a prompt, the question that they enter will get sent to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding model, it will be embedded, it will then do a search, a semantic search on a vector database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case, MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, obviously, which will pull back similar documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">so then those documents along with the original prompt for the most cases will go into the large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">language model, and that will give an answer which goes back to the user. And this is kind of what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, most people are doing for all, you know, Chatbot and Copilot and other types of use cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">right? But what's really interesting is that when you use MongoDB, you can go quite a bit farther than this and do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are, you know, in many cases a bit different. So with, you know, RAG, the standard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">RAG is really not going to be enough. The applications of tomorrow are going to need more context, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where the MongoDB document model comes in. So the document model is really just JSON,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and it gets stored inside of MongoDB in something called BSON, which stands for binary JSON, but you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">have things like a name, a profile, you know, you can include whatever you want as long as it's JSON,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and that is actually what you store inside of your database and what you fetch from the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So with the document model, if you're comparing it to something that you would do in kind of a relational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">system where you have objects that your applications are interfacing with, right, like a customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">object or a contact object, and you're, you know, stitching together different tables inside of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">relational database, instead of having to kind of go through all of this pain and hassle, you get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">go to something like this, right, where you just store the objects that your application is using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">directly inside of the database, and there's not all of this kind of reconfiguring and reconnoitering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The way we look at this is that, you know, documents are universal, right? In many cases, they're kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">superset of all, you know, data types that you might want to model. And so you can have JSON, you can have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">tabular data, key value stores, geospatial graph, it goes on. And what this translates to is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more efficient in many places. It is more productive for developers who are building systems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and in many cases it can be more scalable, since MongoDB is just naturally very horizontally scalable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">through sharding. So that's documents, and that's kind of just the core benefit of MongoDB. But now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">when we add on vectors is where things get, you know, really interesting, right? So what we've done is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we've added in HNSW indexes into MongoDB Atlas, which allows you to do approximate nearest neighbor vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">search over data that's stored in your database. And so what you do is you take your embeddings and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">add them directly into the documents that you're already storing in your database. And so if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">had this JSON that had symbol, quarter, and content fields, you could add a content underscore embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">field, which would just be the vectorization of, you know, either your entire document, some piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">data in your document, or some piece of data that's living elsewhere that you're going to map back to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can store all of that inside of your documents. And you can store vectors that are up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">4096 dimensions. Once that's done, you add in an index definition. In this case, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the type of index is a vector search index. You would say the type of field that you're indexing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is a vector. You would say where the path is, where it's located, the number of dimensions, and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">similarity function. So how do you want to determine the distance between the vectors that you're searching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">for and the ones that you're going to find? So once that's done, behind the scenes, the vector index is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately built and kept in sync with data as it's updated inside of the database. And then you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">use our dollar vector search aggregation stage to go ahead and compute an approximate nearest neighbor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">search. And so you have your index. You have the query vector, which is the vectorization of the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're searching for. You have the path where the data lives inside of your documents. And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">have num candidates and limits. And so the limit is how many results you want to get back from this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">stage. And the num candidates is how many entry points into your HNSW graph do you want to make,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">which allows you to kind of tune the accuracy of your results. And then finally, you can use a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">filter. And this filter is basically a pre-filter. So as we traverse this graph, we'll allow you to kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of fetch the documents and filter out the ones that are less relevant for your specific query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is vector search capability. But there's one other kind of core thing that's really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to just call out that we've also introduced alongside vector search, which is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">called search nodes. And this allows you to decouple your approach to scaling. So with a transactional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">database, right, you have a primary and two secondaries. And this allows you to have, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">durability, high availability, and all of these guarantees that you would want for a transactional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">database. But when you're adding search to it, the profile of resource usage may be a bit different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we've done is we've added in a new type of node into the platform that allows you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">store your vector indexes on those nodes and scale them independently from the infrastructure that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">storing your transactional data. And this allows you to really tune the amount of resources that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">bring to bear to perfectly serve your workload. And so with that, we've really kind of transformed how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Atlas can serve these vector search workloads by both giving you kind of a unified interface</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and a consistent use of the document model, yet at the same time kind of decoupling how you go about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">scaling for your workloads. And that's really kind of the true power of what we've done with vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">search. But along with this, we've also built several different AI integrations. And so we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">integrated into some of the most popular AI frameworks, right? We have integrations inside of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Lama Index, Langchain, Microsoft Semantic kernel, AWS Bedrock, and Haystack. And in each of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we support quite a different -- quite a few different primitives. And so we have, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">just to name a few, inside of Langchain, we have vector store, but you can also have a chat message</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">history, you know, abstraction inside of Langchain. We have quite a few in Lama Index, and then, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">same for Haystack and AWS Bedrock. And so all of these allow you to do that next level of rag that I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about at the very beginning, where you not only get to combine kind of just your typical vector search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">with rag, but you also get to now use kind of transactional data inside of your database to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">augment your prompts. And so to give you just like a couple examples of what that ends up looking like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right, when you think about kind of more broad usage of memory for large language models, you might think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">about semantic caching. So this is capability inside of Langchain, and you can use MongoDB as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">backend of that semantic cache. And now, right, when a user comes in and asks a question, we'll first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of send it over to the retriever and figure out kind of what the question should look like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">right, find the prompt plus the additional kind of augmented data. And then we'll send it to a semantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">cache. And if that semantic cache is it's a hit based on a semantic similarity, then we'll just fetch the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">cached answer instead of having to hit the LLM again. Or if it's not a hit, we'll send it to the LLM and do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt and get the answer back to the user. And so in this way, you can use caching to kind of reduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the amount of calls that are being sent to your large language model. And this is, you know, hugely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful, just kind of reducing the amount of resources that you're using. And again, it can all be done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">using one database with Langchain in this case. Separately, though, right, we also now have chat history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so with Langchain, if you wanted to build on top of MongoDB a experience that was maybe similar to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, ChatGPT, right, where you have the chat history, and it's continuously fetching that data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and putting it back into the prompt so that you can kind of have continuity in the conversation that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">happening with the large language model. Well, you could use the chat message history abstraction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of Langchain, and you could basically store the history of chats that are going through the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">platform. And each time a prompt is sent back into the large language model, you could use the chat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">history, send it back through, include the vector search, and then, you know, send the prompt to the LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and send the answer back. And so just another way where you can really kind of evolve this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">A cool startup that's using us right now to do a lot of these different things where they're taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">advantage of kind of all of the flexibility of having a transactional database kind of built in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ey275TX4ZU&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with your vector search capability is a company called 4149.
