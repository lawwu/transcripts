And then a clothing collection and handbags and sunglasses and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">fragrance. So we caught a moment and we found a positioning for this self-purchasing, multidimensional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">woman. And we made dressing for work aspirational. At the time we launched, if you wanted to buy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something for an office context, the brands that existed were the opposite of exciting. Nobody was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">taking pictures of what they were wearing to work and posting it online with some of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">classic legacy brands. Really, it felt very much like it was designed by a team of men for what a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">woman would want to wear to the office. So we started creating this clothing that was feminine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3892" target="_blank">01:04:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that was beautiful, that was versatile, that would take a woman from the boardroom to an afterschool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3900" target="_blank">01:05:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">soccer game, to a date night with a boyfriend, to a walk in the park with her husband. All the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">different ways women live their lives and creating a wardrobe for that woman who works at every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3915" target="_blank">01:05:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of their life, not just sort of the siloed professional part. And it was really compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We started creating great brand content and we had incredible contributors like Adam Grant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who was blogging for us at the time and creating aspirational content for working women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3937" target="_blank">01:05:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It was actually kind of a funny story, but I now had probably close to 11 different product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3943" target="_blank">01:05:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">categories and we were growing like wildfire.

And we came up with a website called Women Who Work. And I went to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a marketing agency, one of the fancy firms in New York, and I said, "We want to create a brand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">campaign around this multidimensional woman who works.

And I just start laughing because I'm like, "Women who do?" And the fact that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't conceive of it being sort of exciting and aspirational and interesting to sort of lean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3990" target="_blank">01:06:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">into working at all aspects of our lives was just fascinating to me, but showed that that was part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of the problem.

And I think it really resonated with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4016" target="_blank">01:06:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">people in an amazing way.

What's that mean? What does it take to do that? Well, I still wear the shoes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's a good starting point, right? Is to create a thing that you want to wear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like the product, I think first and foremost, you have to have the right partner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So building a shoe, if you talk to a great shoe designer, it's like it's architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like making a heel that's four inches that feels good to walk in for eight hours a day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that is an engineering feat. And so I found great partners in everything that I did. My</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">shoe partner had founded Nine West, so he really knew what went into making a shoe wearable and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">comfortable. And then you overlay that with great design. And we also created this really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4117" target="_blank">01:08:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">comfortable, beautifully designed, super feminine product offering that was also affordably priced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it was like the trifecta of those three things that I think it made it stand out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for so many people. Can you speak to, I don't know if it's possible to articulate, but can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4136" target="_blank">01:08:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you speak to the process you go through from idea to the final thing? Like what you go through to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">bring an idea to life? So not being a designer, and this was true in real estate as well, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4149" target="_blank">01:09:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">never the architect. So I didn't necessarily have the pen and in fashion the same. I was kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like a conductor. I knew what I liked and didn't like, and I think that's really important. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that became honed for me over time. So I would have to sit a lot longer with something earlier on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4168" target="_blank">01:09:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">than later when I had more refined my aesthetic point of view. And so I think, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to have a pretty strong sense of what resonates with you. And then as in the case of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4183" target="_blank">01:09:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">my fashion business, as it grew and became quite a large business, and I had so many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4190" target="_blank">01:09:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">categories, everything had to work together. So I had individual partners for each category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4194" target="_blank">01:09:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we were selling at Neiman Marcus, we couldn't have a pair of shoes that didn't relate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to a dress that didn't relate to a pair of sunglasses and handbags all on the same floor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4204" target="_blank">01:10:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the beginning, it was much more collaborative. As time passed, I really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4212" target="_blank">01:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of took the point on deciding, and this is the aesthetic for the season. These are the colors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4217" target="_blank">01:10:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to use. These are fabrics. And then working with our partners on the execution of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4222" target="_blank">01:10:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that, I needed to create an overlay that allowed for cohesion as the collection grew. And that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually really fun for me because that was a little different. I was typically initially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4234" target="_blank">01:10:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">responding to things that were put in front of me. And towards the end, it was my partners who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were responding to the things that myself and my team. But I always wanted to bring the best talent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4249" target="_blank">01:10:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in. So I was hiring great designers and printmakers and copywriters. And so I had this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">almost like that conductor analogy. I had this incredible group of, in this case, women</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4266" target="_blank">01:11:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">assembled who had very strong points of view themselves and created a great team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4275" target="_blank">01:11:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, I mean, great team is really sort of essential. It's the essential thing behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4280" target="_blank">01:11:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">any successful story. But there's this thing of taste, which is really interesting because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4285" target="_blank">01:11:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to kind of articulate what it takes. But basically knowing A versus B, what looks good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4292" target="_blank">01:11:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or without A/B comparison to say like, if we changed this part, that would make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4302" target="_blank">01:11:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That sort of designer taste, it's hard to make explicit what that is. But the great designers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4309" target="_blank">01:11:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have that taste, like this is going to look good. And it's not actually, again, the Steve Jobs thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not the opinion poll.

You have to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4322" target="_blank">01:12:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the vision of that. And as you said, you also have to develop eventually the confidence that your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4329" target="_blank">01:12:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">taste is good, such that you can curate, you can direct teams, you can argue that, no, no, no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4336" target="_blank">01:12:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this is right.

If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4340" target="_blank">01:12:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have that vision, have the confidence, this will look good. That's how you come up with great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=4345" target="_blank">01:12:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">designs.

There, there is, but I actually think in this case, as you get older,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5333" target="_blank">01:28:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you may act less impulsively, but I think you're more like attuned with, you have more experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5341" target="_blank">01:29:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So your, your gut is like more well honed, you know, so your instincts are more well honed.

Well, I think you can learn everything about life from Joe Rivers. So I'm just, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5376" target="_blank">01:29:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">got it. Amazing. But you know, I, it was, it was such a wild experience for me because I was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5385" target="_blank">01:29:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I was quite young when I was on it, just getting started in business. And it was the number one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5390" target="_blank">01:29:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">television show in the country. And it went on to be syndicated all over the world. And it was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5396" target="_blank">01:29:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this wild, like phenomenal success. You know, a business show had never, had never crossed over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5404" target="_blank">01:30:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in this sort of way. So it was really a moment in time. And you had regular Apprentice and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5411" target="_blank">01:30:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the Celebrity Apprentice, but, but the tasks, I mean, they, they went on to be studied at business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5416" target="_blank">01:30:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">schools across the country. So every other week I'd be reading case studies of how The Apprentice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5421" target="_blank">01:30:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">was being examined and taught to classes and this university in Boston or, you know, so it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5427" target="_blank">01:30:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">extraordinary. And this was like a real life classroom I was in. So I think because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5433" target="_blank">01:30:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">nature of the show, you learn a lot about, you know, teamwork and you're watching it and analyzing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5438" target="_blank">01:30:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it real time. You learned a lot about, a lot of the tasks were very marketing oriented because of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5445" target="_blank">01:30:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the short duration of time they had to, to execute. A lot of, you learned a lot about time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5453" target="_blank">01:30:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">management because of that short duration. So, you know, almost every episode would devolve into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5459" target="_blank">01:30:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people hysterical over the fact that they had 10 minutes left to, with this Herculean lift ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5465" target="_blank">01:31:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of them. So, so it was, it was a fascinating, it was a fascinating experience for me. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5471" target="_blank">01:31:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and we would be filming, I mean, we would film first thing in the morning at like 5 or 6 a.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5477" target="_blank">01:31:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in Trump Tower oftentimes, like in the lobby of Trump Tower, that's where the war rooms and board</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5485" target="_blank">01:31:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">rooms of the candidates were, the contestants were. And then we would go up in the elevator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5491" target="_blank">01:31:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to our office. We would work all day and then we'd come down and we'd evaluate the tasks. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5496" target="_blank">01:31:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was this weird, like real life television thing experience in the middle of our, sort of on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5504" target="_blank">01:31:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">bookends of our work day. So it was, it was intense. So you're, you're like curating the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5510" target="_blank">01:31:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">television version of it and also living it. Living the, and oftentimes there was like an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5515" target="_blank">01:31:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">overlay. Like there were episodes that they came up with brand campaigns for my shoe collection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5522" target="_blank">01:32:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or my clothing line or, or design challenges related to, you know, a hotel I was responsible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5530" target="_blank">01:32:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for, for building.

What was it like? Was it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5542" target="_blank">01:32:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">was it scary to be in front of a camera when you know so many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5546" target="_blank">01:32:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">watch?

Just the number of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5552" target="_blank">01:32:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">watching.

I, I just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5573" target="_blank">01:32:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's... Hey, I have to watch myself as after, after we record this, before I publish it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxdDKHdcM8&t=5582" target="_blank">01:33:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to listen to my stupid self talk.
