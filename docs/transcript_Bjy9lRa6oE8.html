When you're doing something new, there's this pattern that just repeats over and over again. And if you look back in history, it's basically been the pattern for hundreds of thousands of years. You're going to do something new.</p><p>It's going to be very risky. It's going to be some very complicated effort that's going to involve a path-dependent kind of journey through a complex adaptive system. Reality is going to be very fuzzy and messy, and you're going to have a very idiosyncratic set of people who start and run that project, they're going to be highly disagreeable because that's the kind of people who do new things.</p><p>They're going to need to build something bigger than themselves, right? They're going to need to assemble a team and like a whole effort. They're going to run into all kinds of problems and issues along the way. Every time you see that pattern, there's just this role where there's somebody in the background who's okay.</p><p>This one, not that one, this founder, not that founder, this expedition, not that expedition, movie, not that movie. And those people play a judgment and taste role. They play an endorsement branding marketing role. and then they often play a financing role.</p></div></div></body></html>
