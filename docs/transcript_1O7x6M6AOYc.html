Let's assume for the moment that it's just the two of you. Am I also assuming that for some reason there's a nonstop flight anywhere in the world? - That's a fantastic advanced level question. Let's assume no, we're gonna play it on hard level, not like magical level, let's be realistic.</p><p>- That's a great question, the reason I ask is I've always wanted to go to the Canary Islands and they seem quite difficult to get to from the West Coast. I think, and how long are we going for? - You're going for the long weekend, so you fly out on Thursday night and you'll be back either Sunday or Monday.</p><p>- I'm gonna have to think about this. - Well, I have my answer 'cause I prepared, can I tell you my answer? - Yeah. - So I've been dying to go to Buenos Aires and here's why, there's a direct flight from many places, probably from San Francisco, from Houston, from New York, it's in the same time zone.</p><p>And so you can take the flight at like 10 p.m. and you land, it's like a 10 hour flight and you land at 10 a.m. local time, you've not missed any time, there's no jet lag per se. To me, it seems like the most perfect like whole new world environment and it's currency arbitrage because right now with not only the strong dollar, but just the rampant inflation there and all the other stuff, it now does open up some interesting times for the dollar traveler to get exceptional value.</p><p>- Yeah, we did a trip to Buenos Aires, I don't know if this is still the case, I should be prepared, but I didn't know this was coming. But at the time there were two exchange rates. So there's the, I think it was like the dollar blue, which is like the off market exchange rate and then the one you get.</p><p>So you never, at least at the time, please fact check all this, at the time you never wanna pay with a credit card because they're going at the bank rate. But the other rate was like half the price. So you would basically like walk down the street and someone be like, you need currency, you need exchange, and you'd walk into some random place.</p><p>I remember at the time I was like watching YouTube videos on like how to test the currency if it's real because everyone's buying all their currency in like back alleys and now there's WhatsApp groups and you'd message them and they'd come to your hotel. But I can only imagine that if inflation has gone rampant, the dollar has gone more valuable, it's even more valuable to do this.</p><p>- I second that. The only thing I'd say is we went to Argentina, Buenos Aires is awesome. It's incredible. It's one of the few places in the world, maybe New Orleans is similar, where people will say, "Oh, you've gotta check out the cemeteries," which is a strange thing to recommend, but they're just so interesting and different than you've seen anywhere and beautiful and ornate.</p><p>But there's just so much cool stuff in Argentina that I wish that you would have more time than a weekend to go there. But I did do an episode for you to listen to with the basketball player, Manu Ginobili, who's from Argentina, where he talked about some of his favorite tips.</p><p>So check that out before you go. - I always love to. - I also did a similar trip for a long weekend to Bogota, which was awesome. Even closer, same time zone, really accessible. Gosh, I don't know where I would go for a long weekend. - So let me throw some ideas out of there.</p><p>Is that okay? - Yeah, go for it. - Would you guys go to Hawaii? - We are going to Hawaii in a few months, so I feel like I would not go there this weekend if it was a surprise adventure. - 10, would you go to Japan? - 100%, but Japan is not open right now.</p><p>- That's right, oh, you're right, you're right, you're right. Okay. - So Japan would always be the number one on the list. It's like, if you want to go on a trip, we're always like, is Japan possible? If not, we'll look at the rest of the world. - Yes.</p><p>Would you go to Bangkok? Would you do anything in Southeast Asia? - Yeah, so we're actually talking, this is so funny, all the things you mentioned. So we're talking about taking a trip maybe October, November for a couple weeks with kids and au pair. And the plan was to go to Japan, but because it's closed, now we're talking about Bali or Vietnam or Thailand because we had so much fun there.</p><p>The trip, if you hadn't constrained it to a weekend, would be, let's go to New Zealand. I've heard incredible things about New Zealand, nonstop flight, crazy long, way more manageable without children than with, and that would be the place. But I just couldn't imagine going all the way there and then turning around three days later and coming back.</p><p>So that would have been my go-to had that not been the constraint. - I love the New Zealand. Is there any place in South America or Central America that is interesting to you? You mentioned Bogota. I went to Medellin and I have to admit, I didn't feel safe there.</p><p>I felt, we heard a couple stories where there was one day, I just wanted to go take a nap in the park. And someone was like, you're not gonna take a nap in the park. That's not a thing that we do here. And the idea to not have your cell phone out and things like that, it became enough where I was just kind of spooked eventually and we bounced.</p><p>But I heard so many great things about Medellin. I'm curious what your Bogota experience was or if there's anywhere else in Central or South America. - Yeah, I mean, if I were recommending to other people, I could go on for a great list of definitely Mexico City, awesome weekend trip from the US.</p><p>You just wanna sit on the beach and relax. Cabo's a great trip from the US. Bogota was a great trip. - Oh, what's up with Oaxaca? Have you been to Oaxaca? - I have not, but I've heard cool things. I haven't been. So I think one place I'd go for the long weekend, I'd go to Costa Rica.</p><p>I went once before my wife and I, like, I think we'd even met. And it was awesome. And she's never been, she's wanted to go. And now it's been 10 plus years. A lot of what we'd wanna do, we looked at doing with kids and we were like, gosh, it's just not the right place to go right now.</p><p>Like, I wanna go surfing. We wanna go like hiking in the rainforest. And like, they're just not the most toddler-friendly activities. So to finally answer your question, if we got thrown on a plane right now, this weekend, I'd say let's go to Costa Rica. It's not the most inconvenient from the West Coast, way easier from LA because there's direct flights.</p><p>That's probably where we'd go. - All the hacks, listen or meet up in Costa Rica. Get ready. - With a cocktail party. - With a cocktail party, with the name tags.</p></div></div></body></html>
