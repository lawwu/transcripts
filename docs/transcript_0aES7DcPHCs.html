That is my one word definition of happiness, progress. Whether it's progress in your finances, in your relationship with your significant other, with your children, with a hobby that you're trying to get better at, progress is my one word definition of happiness.</p><p>Is that the end goal, is just making progress towards all the things you care about? Is that how you view what money allows you to do or what life's for? You know, it's like one of those interview questions, like what is that one word, right? So that would be my word, but I don't know if that's the end goal.</p><p>I think we always need to be trying to improve ourselves in whatever endeavor we take on. We should probably try to challenge ourselves in something that's a little bit scary, a little bit impossible sounding, so that at least we don't look back with regret having not tried our best or not having not tried at all.</p></div></div></body></html>
