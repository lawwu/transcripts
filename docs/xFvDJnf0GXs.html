The next question is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvDJnf0GXs&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">sentence correction question.

And Bing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvDJnf0GXs&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">does an excellent job and gets this right.

What about the third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvDJnf0GXs&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">question? There are eight questions total. Well, this is an interesting one. Bing gets this wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvDJnf0GXs&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm very curious as to why.

Bing can't quite get its head around that logic. It just restates what the passage says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvDJnf0GXs&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and says this is contradicted without really giving a reason why. Instead, it says what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvDJnf0GXs&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">can conclude is that the amount of money a nation spends on R&D is directly related to the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvDJnf0GXs&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of inventions patented in that nation.
