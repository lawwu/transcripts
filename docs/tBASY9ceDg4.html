How do we think about all the bacteria? And I guess like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a one-on-one, a one-on-one on gut health for people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing I want people to know is that the gut actually starts right at the top with the mouth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where digestion happens. And in fact, even before the food hits your mouth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you start digesting.

So as soon as a food hits the mouth, it starts to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">get digested. And of course, we chew it up in our mouth and then it travels down the esophagus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Food hits the stomach. It gets churned up into something called chyme. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">more enzymes, gastrin, lots of different enzymes, hydrochloric acid. After the stomach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">it goes into the small intestine. And then we get to the large intestine, sometimes called the colon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the interesting things is that even though it's one continuous tube from your mouth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to your anus, all the different parts work completely differently.

So for example, in the esophagus, you have a squamous lining,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which is very sensitive to acid because there's not supposed to be acid in your esophagus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In the stomach, you have a columnar lining, which is resistant to acid. Different parts release</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">different enzymes. Different parts can churn up food differently. So it's very specialized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">even though it's all connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are some of the kind of main roles this entire gut system plays in maintaining our health?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sort of embarrassed to say that I had been a gastroenterologist about 15 years before I figured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">out this one simple, incredible thing.

The gut bacteria help with that. So that's one of the first things. It's a defense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to prevent things from getting into the rest of our body.

Because normally when you have intact stomach acid, you swallow SARS-CoV-2,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can breathe it in, but you can also swallow it. And then that stomach acid unravels a viral protein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and inactivates it.

It can protect you from poliovirus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and from different bacteria.

I have stomach acid. Viruses can't make me sick. So that's just a huge difference right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">there.

Your kids have a healthy immune</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">system.

That kid could have a very serious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">immune deficiency syndrome or some other reason, but most of the time it's a terrible idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a terrible idea because the kid is not catching Ebola from the tray.

So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">bathing too, like your kids, um, you know, let them get dirty.

How does someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">even know if they have a healthy gut?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some really important feedback loops in the body and the gut has a lot of them. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked about reflux earlier on, if you are having heartburn, it is not because you're overproducing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">acid.

It's because they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">having inappropriate opening of that lower esophageal sphincter. Why is it opening inappropriately?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Eating too late at night, eating too much food, too much caffeine, too much alcohol. So overfilling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the stomach causes a valve to pop open and things like caffeine and alcohol, nicotine also can make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that valve open. But what do we do? We go out and we take these acid blockers instead of paying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">attention to that. When you have reflux, it's not because your body is not working. Your body is giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you really important feedback and saying, hey, that eight o'clock meal that you're having every night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you're lying on the couch, not a great idea. Or that extra cup of coffee or the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">glass of wine or whatever it is. So that's an important part of feedback higher up. Constipation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">is also really important feedback. Constipation on its own isn't a disease, it's a symptom. And it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">symptom that either you're not putting in the right output to get the desired output, you're not hydrating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">enough. So things are kind of getting stuck along the way. Maybe you're taking a medication that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">slowing down your gut motility.

Often it is a medicine cabinet. And so when somebody comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to see me with something like bloating and constipation, which are really common GI symptoms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">irregularity, the first place I go is a medicine cabinet. Because, for example, a lot of vitamins can cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">gut distress. They can slow down gut motility. Anything containing iron in it is going to slow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">down. Your gut motility can make you constipated. Calcium-containing supplements, et cetera, can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">do that. Prescription medications, pain medications, of course, can slow down the gut. But even medications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you might not think about, like antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, those often cause bloating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and constipation. There are medications that people are on for high blood pressure that do it. So the list is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really long. And we're just talking about causing constipation. If we look at now messing up the gut</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">microbiome, there was a study that was published in the journal Nature, and they looked at 41 different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">medications, and they found that half of them were causing problems in the gut microbiome, including</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">things like laxatives that, you know, you think, okay, I have a slow gut. I'm going to take a laxative. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think the laxative is actually messing up your microbiome. Artificial sweeteners, anti-anxiety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">drugs like Prozac. So the list is really long. So the medicine cabinet is one of the first places I go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have to think about, okay, hormonally, is there something going on? Is my thyroid underactive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why my gut motility is slow. So it's always a good idea. Check your thyroid function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are suddenly finding you're more constipated, things are slowed down. So could it be something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">hormonal like that?

Do you have a mass,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBASY9ceDg4&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">a tumor or something that's pressing on your gut?
