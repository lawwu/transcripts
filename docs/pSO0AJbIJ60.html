I mean, it's probably not the worst, but it's definitely not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the most optimal. And there's a lot of benefits to taking little retirements. But I would say the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">one that probably resonates the most is the fact that there are seasons in life with expiration dates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So if your plan is to work super hard for 40 years and never take a break with the idea of when I get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">65, I'll do all those things that I never did.

Your kids aren't five and seven anymore. They can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do this massive road trip with you.

Maybe your health isn't what it was. Maybe your preferences changed. And backpacking through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Europe and sleeping in hostels, you're like, I don't know if that's my jam anymore. But if you are hoping that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just delay all these amazing things till the end, some things will wait. But there's a whole bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of stuff that won't. I just had this conversation with a friend yesterday, where he and I both have two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">daughters. And they're both in that like, three to seven year range. And we were like, in 10 years, our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">daughters might not want to hang out with us. But right now, they think we're the coolest people in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">world. And we were just brainstorming what we should do because of that. Like it was just timely because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned that we were talking today. It's like, how do we take advantage of the fact doesn't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">be today. But like, we've got an expiring window where our children think we're awesome and want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hang out with us. And when I was in high school, I wasn't like, Oh, I want to just go spend every waking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">moment with my parents. But my kids do right now. Yeah, things change. And I think there's some that we know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">will change. We can anticipate this might be different. But then honestly, there's things in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">life that you didn't know it had an expiration date. You know, your spouse gets MS. And you were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't know that like hiking Montju Pichu had an expiration date that was coming up in five years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">someone passes away. And so I think by being intentional of like, what if we just took a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">break? Every three years, every five years, we took a month off or six months off. And we leaned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">into the things that might pass us by if we try to wait on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to get into how do you do this? Why is it not just for the super wealthy, like why this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">could be for anyone in different ways and shapes. But first, I just want to understand how would you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">define a mini retirement?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, a mini retirement has three elements. The first one is a month or longer. I feel like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">month is kind of the minimum effective dose. The second one is stepping away from your primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">career, stepping away from your nine to five. So for a lot of people, it does look like a big adventure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">or travel or hobbies or family. But for some people, it can be a professional pivot or starting a side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">hustle or just doing something really different volunteering. The third one is to focus on something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that matters to you, something that's meaningful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And can you partially step away? I'm just thinking out loud like, oh, what if we decided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to make the podcast every other week for three months next summer? Would that count? Because I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">still working, but not really as much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So everyone can just, you know, use whatever term they want that fits their prerogative. I do for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">self-employed people, I in the book, I have a whole chapter just for self-employed because it's a whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">different bear. But I do encourage people for your first one, maybe start with 10% of the work you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">normally do. Because going to 0% is actually for most self-employed people more stressful than doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">10%. So if you normally work 50 hours, like just dedicate an hour a day, five days a week to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">sure nothing's burned down, to do the most critical tasks. Because for a lot of self-employed people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that little check-in actually allows them to pivot, to go out and have fun for the day and to relax and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">be more fully present in their time off. And what kind of impact broadly do you think taking multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">retirements throughout your life has on your time, your money, your energy? How does it affect those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">things? I try to make a case in the book. I think for a lot of people, the personal life one makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">sense. Yeah, I can focus on my health. I can focus on my relationships. I can develop hobbies. Like I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">take care of myself.

And now what I just heard you say is, well, actually you might have more money by not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">working. I was going to talk about this later, but like, let's just jump right into that now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">How is that possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a couple factors at play. One big one for a lot of people, your largest raise and your biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">promotion comes when you switch companies. It's not with your current employer. So if you're 25, 30, 35,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and kind of mapping out your career, if you were like, what if every five years, I decided to switch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">companies, I take a month off, I take three months off in between, and then I find my next job that might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">massively increase your lifetime earning potential.

A good example of this. I had a friend who took a mini retirement, took a year off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He came back to a 50% increase at his next job, which you're like, oh my gosh, that's amazing. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds so cool. It was because he had worked as previous employer for 15 years, which meant for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of years, he was being undercompensated. He was not at market value. His market value was 150%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly. And so I'm kind of a numbers geek. So if let's say for eight of those years, he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">undercompensated. Well, that's $400,000. Let's say his year off cost him a hundred thousand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He would still be $300,000 ahead if he would have taken consistent mini retirements. So by the time he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">was 65, I don't know, a million dollars, $2 million ahead. Like he left so much money on the table</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">by being quote unquote, loyal to his employer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now to take the contrarian take, if every five years he had switched jobs and never taken a mini</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">retirement, he would probably be even more ahead financially speaking only, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think personal life, by having those consistent breaks, a mini retirement can be almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like a capital investment into your personal life. I took a mini retirement in my late twenties. I took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a month off and I did intensive inpatient therapy, like six hours of therapy a day. It was like a full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">house renovation. Now I've done a live-in renovation where like you do it real slowly in the middle of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">your regular life and it's so painful. But if you can just like renovate a house in a month, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to move back into like a fully finished house, much more preferable.

But then I come back to your definition and I think, oh, wait,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to focus on things that matter to me.

But first I just got to get all this stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">done that I haven't been doing in the house, right? Like we want to clean up the storage room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to move the beds around.

One of two ways. It can take up your whole time. And if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that's your goal and your intention, and that's what's meaningful, like, I feel like I'm drowning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I would rather not feel like I'm drowning every single day. I think that's a worthy goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of people do get caught up on projects on life. I'm guilty of like, sometimes I have over a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred tabs open on my phone and then it stops counting. It's just like a little smiley face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes you have too many tabs open and closing all those loops out does improve your quality of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">life going forward. For some people, it is finishing up a specific project. During one of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">mini retirements, I decluttered and I went through the entire house. I touched every single item and got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">covered a 50% of our stuff. I had five little kids at the time, like massive benefit moving forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to not feel like I was living in a storage unit. So it can be really meaningful. But on the other side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I encourage people to pick maybe two or three intentions for their time off. Don't do all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">them at the same time, but create kind of phases. And for a lot of people, that first phase is kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">get caught up on life, recover from burnout, do some rest, just feel more at their baseline. And that can be a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">way to start a mini retirement, especially the first two or three weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In the book, you outline these four steps. And so I'm going to drill on part of the first one, which is like, there's some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">filters for setting goals. How do you think about that goal setting for mini retirements? And maybe before that, what are some common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">types beyond the let's declutter or let's travel, which I assume are pretty common?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Extended travel, slow travel, super popular. It's stuff that can't fit into nights and weekends. Like you're not going to hike the Camino on a four day weekend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Or whether you just feel like realistically, it's not going to happen. Should it be able to happen? Cool. Yeah, maybe. About when I turned 40, I realized, oh, I have to take care of my 40 year old body different than my 23 year old body. It has like different requirements. Now it needs vegetables, I think. I don't know. I can't eat candy for breakfast. I was like, I need to figure this out. And it can be easy to be like, yes, while raising five kids and while running a business and while doing all these other things and all these other responsibilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I should also learn an entire different way of feeding myself and moving my body. But I just couldn't. So taking some time off and being like, I'm going to do a deep dive. I'm going to reset all my habits. I'm going to reimagine how I care for myself was a really important investment into my future health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we talked about things that have an expiration date. For a lot of people that looks like recovering from burnout. Hard to do sometimes at nights and weekends. Time with people we love, hobbies, personal growth, you know, those dreams that we kind of gave up on because we thought, well, that's not going to be part of my life or that's not realistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">A mini retirement's a great opportunity to loop back around to that. I always thought I would do social dancing and then I just never did. So last year I took a month off to learn tango and it was amazing. I had so much fun, but sometimes, you know, you thought like I wanted to be in a band. You can start a band and play for a month in your garage. You can do a long hike.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You can loop back around to those dreams that maybe you thought didn't fit into your life and you can give them a go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This episode is brought to you by Stable, which is a company that has really made my life better this year.

target="_blank">00:17:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I keep coming back to the other objections that either I or other people might have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like the biggest one is no income coming in, spending more money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about the financial side of this, how do you think people should start to approach this so it doesn't feel so daunting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So if your time off is going to be unpaid, maybe your employer will pay it, but maybe they won't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe with your business, it will create income.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But worst case scenario is if it's going to be unpaid, you have to cover all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have the additional budget for whatever your kind of activity is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I encourage people to try to keep it within 50% of their monthly take-home pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you bring home, let's say, $5,000 a month, maybe spend an additional $2,500 on your mini-retirement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">which is also one of the reasons that mini-retirements are actually accessible for people at all sorts of income levels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because the cost is very proportional to how much you make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in the case of an unpaid time off, right, you've stepped away from your job, no one's going to pay you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then you'd probably have to not save $3,000, but $9,000, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it depends how long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have your monthly salary plus up to 50% of whatever that take-home pay is, so per month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah.</span></div><div

one month, then yes, yeah, it wouldn't be that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.880</a></span> |

times however many months you want to be gone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.860</a></span> | <span

thinking about, you're saying take-home pay, and I think it's really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because I know a lot of people do the math about how much they make and how much they spend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and they often use their kind of like gross salary number, and they think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I make $120,000 a year, I make $10,000 a month, I need to replace that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, well, no, if you're not making money, you're not paying taxes on that money either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the after-tax amount, it's the take-home amount, not necessarily the full amount that you are getting paid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.380</a></span> | <span

talking a month or three months, pausing, you know, your retirement contributions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1152"

to come up with your mini retirement story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.540</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is it needs to be positive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if there's like a negative reason, like you're really

make it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSO0AJbIJ60&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of saying, I just
