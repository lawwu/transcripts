Whether you like ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude or Perplexity, I'm impartial to what tool you use. But for travel planning, for research, I feel like I have an army of interns at my disposal to go do all kinds of stuff. Can you draft this? Can you review this legal doc?</p><p>Can you help me come up with an itinerary? Can you go research something for personal life, for work? Can you help me summarize this? It's just such an amazing tool. I can't imagine how much longer it would take me to do all kinds of work in my life than it does now.</p><p>And if you're not using any of these tools regularly, I would strongly encourage you to give them a try. I would encourage you to find someone in your circle of friends that probably uses them more than you and ask them how they're using them because I'm constantly getting new ideas of ways to do things.</p><p>This morning, my daughter asked, how many sprinkles are on my pancakes? And there were more than enough on her plate than I wanted to count. And we were like, oh, I wonder if ChatGPT could answer. It's at a number about 4,000. So I will say that's not the best example of something you can do.</p><p>But I'm always experimenting for ways that some AI tool could save me time or get me to a better answer sooner.</p></div></div></body></html>
