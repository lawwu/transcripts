So how do you beat them? He can never raise that many troops</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">himself. And Hannibal, I think correctly figures out the one way to maybe defeat Rome is to cut</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">them away from their allies. Well, how do you do this? Hannibal's plan is, I'm not going to wait</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and fight the Romans in Spain or North Africa. I'm going to invade Italy. So I'm going to strike at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the heart of this growing Roman empire. And my hope is that if I can win a couple big battles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">against Rome in Italy, the Italians will want their freedom back and they'll rebel from Rome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe even join me because most people who have been conquered want their freedom back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a reasonable plan. So Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">dramatic stuff. Nobody expects him to do this. Nobody thinks you can do this. Shows up in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Northern Italy. Romans send an army, Hannibal massacres them. He is a military genius. Rome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">takes a year, raises a second army. We know this story. Sends it against Hannibal. Hannibal wipes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">him out. Rome gets clever this time. They say, "Okay, Hannibal's different. We're going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">two years, raise two armies and send them both out at the same time against Hannibal."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So they do this and this is the Battle of Cannae, which is one of the most famous battles in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">history. Hannibal is facing this army of 80,000 Romans about. And he comes up with a strategy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into it later if you want, but it's this famous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy where he basically sucks the Romans in, surrounds them on all sides. And in one afternoon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans. Now, just to put that in perspective,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that's more Romans hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Vietnam.

And now, dear friends, here's Gregory Aldrete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think is the big difference between the ancient world and the modern world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the easy answer, the one you often get is technology. And obviously, there's huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">differences in technology between the ancient world and today. But I think some of the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting stuff is a little bit more amorphous things, more structural things. So I would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">first of all, childhood mortality. In the ancient world, and this is true of Greeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans, Egyptians, really anybody up until about the Industrial Revolution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about 30% to 40% of kids died before they hit puberty. So, I mean, put yourself in the place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of an average inhabitant of the ancient world. If you were an ancient person, three or four of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your kids probably would have died. You would have buried your children. And nowadays, we think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that as an unusual thing. And just psychologically, that's a huge thing. You would have seen multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of your siblings die. If you're a woman, for example, if you were lucky enough to make it to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say, age 13, you probably would have to give birth four or five times in order just to keep the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">population from dying out. So, those kind of grim mortality statistics, I think, are a huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">difference psychologically between the ancient world and the modern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But fundamentally, do you think human nature changed much? Do you think this is the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">elements of what we see today, fear, greed, love, hope, optimism, and the cynicism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the underlying forces that result in war, all of that permeates human history?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Crude answer, yes. I think human nature is roughly constant. And for me, as an ancient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">historian, the kind of documents that I really like dealing with are not the traditional literary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sources, but they're the things that give us those little glimpses into everyday life. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff like tombstones or graffiti or just something that survives on a scrap of parchment that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">records a financial transaction. And whenever I read some of those, I'll have this moment of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">feeling, "Oh, I know exactly how that person felt." Here across 2,000 years of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">completely different cultures, I have this spark of sympathy with someone from antiquity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think as a historian, the way you begin to understand an alien, a foreign culture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what these cultures are, is to look for those little moments of sympathy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But on the other hand, there's ways in which ancient cultures are wildly different from us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you also look for those moments where you just think, "How the hell could these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people have done that?

They were small-town family farmers. And they lived in a little village.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They never traveled 20 miles from that village. They were born there. They married somebody from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there. They raised kids. They mucked around in the dirt for a couple decades, and they died.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They never saw a battle.

So that's what life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">should be, and that's representative. Nevertheless, it is the emperors and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">philosophers and the artists and the warriors who carve history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is the important stuff.

And I would say let's not forget them. So let's not forget what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">life was like for 80, 90% of the people in the ancient world, the ones we don't talk about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's important too. So the Roman Empire is widely considered to be the most powerful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">influential, and impactful empire in human history. What are some reasons for that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, Rome has been hugely influential, I think, just because of the image. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">there's all these practical ways.

And I think that's what gives it a lot of its fascination, this idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that, oh, it was this great, powerful, culturally influential empire.

I mean, we could talk about ancient China, which arguably was just as big as Rome,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just as culturally sophisticated, lasted about the same amount of time. But at least in Western</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">civilization, Rome is the paradigm.

And it's interesting how some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">later civilizations tend to either focus on one or the other of those. So the United States,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">revolutionary France, they were very obsessed with the Roman Republic as a model. But other people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Mussolini, Hitler, Napoleon, they were very obsessed with the empire, Victorian Britain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as a model. So Rome itself has different aspects. Well, what I think is actually another big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">difference between the modern world and the ancient is our relationship with the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the keys to understanding all of Roman history is to understand that this was a people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who were obsessed with the past and for whom the past had power, not just as something inspirational,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but it actually dictated what you would do in your daily life.

And the classical story that I sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tell in my classes to illustrate this is Rome started out as a monarchy. They had kings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they were kind of unhappy with their kings. Around 500 BC, they held a revolution and they kicked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">out the kings. And one of the guys who played a key role in this was a man named Lucius Junius</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Brutus. 500 years later, 500 years down the road, a guy comes along, Julius Caesar, who starts to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">act like a king. So if you have trouble with kings in Roman society, who are you going to call?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody named Brutus. Now, as it happens, there is a guy named Brutus in Roman society at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">time who was one of Julius Caesar's best friends, Marcus Junius Brutus. Now, before I go further</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with the story, and I think you probably know where it ends, I should talk about how important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your ancestors are in Roman culture.

So when a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Roman aristocrat died, they literally put hot wax on his face and made an impression of his face at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that moment.

So every time you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">entered your house, you were literally staring at the faces of your ancestors.

When somebody new in the family died, there would be a big funeral and they would talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all the things their ancestors had did.

So you as an individual weren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">important. You were just the latest iteration of that family. And there was enormous weight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">huge weight to live up to the deeds of your ancestors.

It gives them guidance. But the negatives, what's interesting is it makes the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans extremely traditional minded and extremely conservative.

Today, not so much, but some still do. About a decade ago, I was in Serbia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I was talking to some of the people there about the breakup of Yugoslavia and some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">wars that had taken place where people turned against their neighbors, basically murdered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">people they had lived next to for decades.

It's interesting to remember that, the value of the ancestors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

So you actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">designated them by this special term.

So you mentioned the Republic, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned maybe when it took a form of empire and maybe there's the Age of Kings. What are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">different periods of this Roman, let's call it what, the big-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Roman history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Roman history. And a lot of people just call that whole period Roman Empire loosely, right? So maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">can you speak to the different periods?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, absolutely. So conventionally, Roman history is divided into three chronological periods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The first of those is from 773 BC to 509 BC, which is called the monarchy. So all the periods get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">their names from the form of government. So this is the earliest phase of Roman history. It's when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Rome is mostly just a fairly undistinguished little collection of mud huts, honestly, just like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">dozens of other cities of little mud huts in Italy. So that early phase about 750 to around 500 BC</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is the monarchy, they're ruled by kings. Then there's this revolution, they kick out the kings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they become a republic. That lasts from 500 BC roughly to about either 31 or 27 BC, depending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what date you pick is most important, but about 500 years. And the republic is when they have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">republican form of government. Some people idealize this as Rome's greatest period. And the big thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in that period is Rome first expands to conquer all of Italy in the first 250 years of that 500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">year stretch. And then the second 250 years, they conquer all the Mediterranean basin, roughly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is this time of enormous, successful Roman conquest and expansion. And then you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">another switch up and they become ruled by emperors. So back to the idea of one guy in charge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">though the Romans try to pretend it's not like a king, it's something else. And anyway, we can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">into that, but they're very touchy about kings. So they have emperors, Roman empire, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">emperor is Augustus, starts off as Octavians, which is named Augustus when he becomes emperor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He kind of sets the model for what happens. And then how long does the Roman empire last? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of those great questions. The conventional answer is usually sometime in the fifth century,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so the 400s AD. So about another 500 years, let's say. It's a nice kind of even division,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">500 years of republic, 500 years of empire, but you can make very good cases for lots of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">dates for the end of the Roman empire. I actually think it goes all the way through the end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Byzantine empire in 1453. So another 1500 years, but that's a whole other discussion. But so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your three phases of Roman history.

And when they conquer Greece,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Greek culture just becomes one more arena of competition.

So from about 500 to let's say 250 BC. And in that period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they gradually expand throughout Italy, conquer the other Italian cities who are pretty much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like them.

And Rome first expands in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the Western Mediterranean. And there, their big rival is the city state of Carthage, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">another city founded almost the same time as Rome that has also been a young vigorously expanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">aggressive empire. So in the Western Empire at this time, you have two sort of rival groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're very different because the Romans are these citizen soldier farmers. So the Romans are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all these small farmers, that's the basis of their economy. And it's the Romans who serve in the army.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the person who is a citizen is also really by main profession of farmer, and then in times of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">war, he becomes a soldier. Carthage is an oligarchy of merchants. So it's a very small citizen body,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they make their money through maritime trade. So they have ships that go all over the Mediterranean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't have a large army of Carthaginians, instead, they hire mercenaries mostly to fight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for them. So it's almost these two rival systems. It's different philosophies, different economies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. Rome is strong on land, Carthage is strong at sea. So there's this dichotomy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're both looking to expand and they repeatedly come into conflict as they expand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So Carthage is on the coast of North Africa, Rome's in central Italy, what's right between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">them, the island of Sicily. So the first big war is fought purely dictated by geography,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">who gets Sicily, Rome or Carthage.

And it's just using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the terrain, understanding this. Again, Hannibal's very much outnumbered, but he's able to use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">terrain and to take the enemy by surprise.

So going back to Greece, when they're fighting, let's say Persia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which at the time was the superpower of the ancient world and vastly richer, vastly larger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">than ancient Greece, tons more men.

Whereas the Greeks specialized in what are called hoplites,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a kind of infantrymen with very heavy body armor, a helmet, a spear and a really big,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">heavy shield. And they would get in that formation where you kind of make the shields overlap and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just form this solid mass bristling with spear points and just slowly kind of march forward and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">grind up your enemy in front of you.

And that's taken even further by Alexander the Great,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">who comes up with the idea, well, what if we even give them a longer spear? So Greek spears</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">were six to eight feet long. Alexander the Great arms his armies with the sarissa, which is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">15 foot, almost a pike, this extra long spear. And so when the spear is that long,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't even hardly need the shields anymore. So it's just this incredibly powerful thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in frontal attack. And that's what he uses to make himself ruler of the known world. He goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and conquers the Persian empire and makes himself the Persian king of kings with this phalanx of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">troops armed with the sarissa. So that's very powerful. The Romans go a little bit different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">route. They have heavy infantry, but they focus more on fighting with short swords. So it's get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up close and kind of stab. And the other thing the Romans do is they focus on flexibility and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">subdividing their army. So Alexander's phalanx was a mass of, let's say, 5,000 guys, and it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one unit. The Roman army is organized in an ever decreasing number of subunits. So you have a group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2793" target="_blank">00:46:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of eight guys who are a contubernia, the men who share a tent.

So the Greek hoplites are very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">heavy armor.

And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Can you give me some articles so I could do a better job, some scholarly articles about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this armor?" And with typical sort of academic arrogance, I said, "Why, Scott, of course I will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll give you some references." And I went and looked and there weren't any. So at that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "Huh, tell you what, why don't you and I look into this and try to do a reconstruction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">using only the materials they would have had in the ancient world?"

I mean, it ended up being a 10-year project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">involving 150 students, a couple dozen other faculty members, ended having three documentaries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">made out of it.

So this is how you never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know where your next project's gonna come from.

We first said, "All right, what are all the sources for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this armor?" And in the end, we found 65 accounts of it in ancient literature by 40 different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">authors.

And then we looked at ancient art and we were able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to identify about a thousand images in ancient art in vase paintings, pottery, bronze sculpture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">tomb paintings, all these different things showing this armor. And then using those two things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we tried to backwards engineer a pattern to say, "Well, if this is what the end product looks like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what does it have to look like when you make it?" And then we tried to reconstruct one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these things using only the glue and materials. So we had to use animal glues, rabbit glue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We had to end up sort of making our own linen, which comes from the flax plant. So we had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">grow flax, harvest it using only techniques in the ancient world. So modern flax goes through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">chemical processes. No, we had to do this the old-fashioned way, spin it into thread. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">thread into fabric, glue it all together. And then the fun part was once we made these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we subjected them to ballistics testing. So we shot them with arrows, which again were wooden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">reconstruction arrows using bronze arrowheads that were based on arrowheads found on ancient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3174" target="_blank">00:52:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">battlefields to determine how good protection would this thing have been. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the kind of fun one that everyone always likes and that the documentaries always want is at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one point they're like, "Well, can you put Scott in one of these and shoot him?" And we're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay."

I knew exactly how far that was going to go. So it's one of these, "Don't do this at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">home, kids." >> So there's a million questions to ask here, but in general, how well in terms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of ballistics does it work?

So laminated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or even sewn, it doesn't have to be laminated, layer of linen is about as good protection as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3222" target="_blank">00:53:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">two millimeters of bronze, which was the thickest comparable body armor of bronze at the time. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking fourth century, fifth century BC here.

So the benefits of this are it's much lighter than metal armor. So the line of thorax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is about 11 pounds.

It's cooler. I mean, the Mediterranean is a hot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">place with the hot sun. Even today, a linen shirt is something you wear when you want to be cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's much lighter. That gives your troops greater endurance on the battlefield. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3279" target="_blank">00:54:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can run farther, fight longer.

In fact, probably, this is interesting, any woman in the ancient world could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">have made one of these because they were the ones who spun thread and sewed it into fabric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can easily see in a household, a mother making this for her son, a wife making it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">her husband. So it's a form of armor you could have made domestically that would have been maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not the greatest armor, but pretty good, pretty comparable to bronze armor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's amazing that you used all the materials they had at the time and none of the modern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">techniques. But I should probably say, maybe you can speak to that, they were probably much better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">at doing that than you are, right? Because again, generational, it's a skill. It's a skill that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">probably is practiced across decades, across centuries. I mean, in terms of producing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fabric, I'm sure they could do it 10 times faster than we could. Just that's a speed thing. But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">still incredibly labor intensive. Where I think there's a big difference between our reconstruction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and ancient ones is in the glue. So we ended up using a kind of least common denominator glue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we used rabbit glue, because it would have been available anywhere and it's cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the ancient world, they did have basically the equivalent of super glues. I mean, we found,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, helmets that were fished out of a river in Germany that had metal parts glued</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">together that after 2000 years of immersion in water were still glued together. So they had some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3371" target="_blank">00:56:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">great glues, we just don't know what the recipes for them were. So we went the opposite tack and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Well, we're just going to make something that we know they could have made." So it was at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">least this good, you know what I'm saying? But actually, this is a materials thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think glue, aside from helping glue things together, it can also be a thing that serves as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3395" target="_blank">00:56:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">armor. So if you glue things correctly, the way it permeates the material that is gluing can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">strengthen the material, the integrity of the material. That's an art and a science probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3406" target="_blank">00:56:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that they understood deeply. >> The process of lamination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">did add something. So there's actually a huge debate among scholars and actually a sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">amateur archaeologist that was this line of thorax thing glued together or was it simply sewn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">together?

Because again, every piece of armor in the ancient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">world was an individual creation. So I think if you had some spare leather, you put that in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you wanted to make one that was just sewn together or even quilted, stuffed with stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you do that.

I also have kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">science-y background.

And I think what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3565" target="_blank">00:59:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going on there is technology, that with bronze, it's hard to keep a sharp edge on things.

And a key factor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to penetrating fabric is the edge on the arrowhead, right? So as soon as you start to get something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more like a razor edge, it's going to go through it more easily. Also, there's changes in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">bows that are being used. You start to get sort of Eastern horse archers showing up with composite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bows, which are much more powerful. And so it just becomes outdated as frontline military equipment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What's interesting is by the Roman period, people are still wearing it, but it's now things like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">when I go hunting, if I'm hunting lions, I wear this.

Why was he successful, do you think, as a conqueror? Probably one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">greatest conquerors in the history of humanity. Yeah. And I mean, is he one of the greatest heroes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or one of the greatest villains in humanity too? It's like Julius Caesar. He's famous for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">conquering Gaul. Well, about a million people were killed and a million enslaved in that. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3660" target="_blank">01:01:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">does it make him a horrible person or one of our heroes? But Alexander is a combination of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">two things. One is he really just was a skilled individual. And he was one of those guys who had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it all. He was smart, he was athletic, and he was supremely charismatic. I mean, it's obviously one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of these people that would walk into a room and everyone just kind of gravitates to him. He had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that magic that made him an effective leader. And secondly, he was lucky because it wasn't all him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3689" target="_blank">01:01:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He inherited a system created by his father, Philip II. So he was in the right time at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right place and had this instrument placed in his hands. And then he had the intelligence and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3702" target="_blank">01:01:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">charisma to go use it. So it's one of these coming together of different things. But often,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3707" target="_blank">01:01:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">his father's contribution, I think, is not recognized as much as it is.

So one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the keys to Alexander's success as a tactical sense is that his army was composed of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3730" target="_blank">01:02:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">elements, heavy cavalry, light cavalry, heavy infantry, light infantry, missile troops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And he understand that he can use these in different and flexible ways on the battlefield,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">whereas a lot of warfare before then had just been you line up, two sides smash together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So he did clever things with this army that was a better tool than others did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he was just supremely ambitious. I mean, he cared about his fame, which I guess is ego,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but he clearly cared about that more than he did about things like money. He was indifferent to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And he did have a grand vision. So he did have this vision of trying to unite the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3770" target="_blank">01:02:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">both politically under his control, but also culturally. And this is an interesting thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was very open, in fact, insistent of trying to meld together the best elements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3782" target="_blank">01:03:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of all the different cultures. So he himself was a Macedonian, but he admired Greek culture. So he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3788" target="_blank">01:03:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty much adopted Greek culture as his own. When he conquers Persia, he starts adapting elements of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Persian culture.

He sort of forces</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands of his troops to marry local women.

We're your conquerors, and that's it. And so Alexander had to deal with a lot of friction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3863" target="_blank">01:04:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from his own oldest, most loyal elements at the way he was being, in their eyes, too generous to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the conquered. So Alexander is one of these interesting personalities because every generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sees him in a new light and focuses on different things.

It was, he had this spectacular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">conquest. In 10 years, he conquered what was then most of the known world, but he had no permanent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=3954" target="_blank">01:05:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">structure in place.

So, if I have a tree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4051" target="_blank">01:07:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and its fruit drops onto your property, who owns the fruit?

Well, adult free men who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4511" target="_blank">01:15:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not slaves, who are not resident foreigners, they have this great stuff. And that's always a tiny</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4517" target="_blank">01:15:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">minority of all the human beings who existed in this society. But still, the notion of citizenship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4525" target="_blank">01:15:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is huge. And citizens, for example, early on, you had to be tried at Rome if you were accused of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4531" target="_blank">01:15:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">something. And there's this very famous moment in Sicily where an abusive governor who's corrupt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4539" target="_blank">01:15:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is punishing a citizen arbitrarily. And this person cries out, "Cuius Romanus sum," meaning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4546" target="_blank">01:15:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"I am a Roman citizen." And it really was this hugely loaded statement that that gives me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4553" target="_blank">01:15:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">protections.

So that notion of citizenship is something that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think the Romans really emphasize and becomes a legacy to a lot of civilizations today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4570" target="_blank">01:16:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">where citizenship means something. It's a special status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4573" target="_blank">01:16:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you mentioned slaves. Slavery, that's something that is common throughout human history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4580" target="_blank">01:16:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we know about their relationship with slavery?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4585" target="_blank">01:16:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Roman slavery, a couple just reminders at the beginning. First of all, it's not racial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4590" target="_blank">01:16:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">slavery. So for people in the United States, you tend to think of slavery through this kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4594" target="_blank">01:16:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of racial lens. So slaves in ancient Roman society could be any color, ethnicity, gender, origin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4602" target="_blank">01:16:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. It's an economic status. Now, having said that, slavery is fundamentally horrific to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4610" target="_blank">01:16:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">human dignity because it is defining a human being as an object. And very famously, a Roman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">agricultural writer who's writing about farms, just as a kind of aside says, "You know, on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4622" target="_blank">01:17:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">farm, you have three types of tools.

"You have semi-articulate tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4634" target="_blank">01:17:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which are animals, and you have articulate tools, which are human beings, slaves."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4641" target="_blank">01:17:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And for him, these are all just categories of tools.

So Roman slavery is odd in that it doesn't have this racial component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4653" target="_blank">01:17:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's horrible in the way all slavery is horrible.

It's a permeable membrane, and many people move back and forth across it. So you have many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4666" target="_blank">01:17:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people in the Roman world who were born a slave who gained their freedom through one means or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">another. And you have many others who were born free and become slaves, and you have some who go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4675" target="_blank">01:17:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">back and forth. There's a great Roman tombstone of this guy who says, "I was born a free man in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4680" target="_blank">01:18:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Parthia. I was enslaved. Then I gained my freedom, and I became a teacher or something, and I had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4686" target="_blank">01:18:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">life, and now I'm a Roman citizen." So it's this whole back and forth across all these boundaries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4692" target="_blank">01:18:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple times. Oh, so there's probably a process, like an economic transaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4697" target="_blank">01:18:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The most common source of slaves in the Roman world was war. So wherever the Roman army went,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4704" target="_blank">01:18:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in its wake would be literally a train of slave traders. So you're in war,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4710" target="_blank">01:18:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you capture an enemy city, you whack the people over the head, and you turn around if you're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4713" target="_blank">01:18:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">soldier, and you sell them to one of these slave traders that's following the army around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4717" target="_blank">01:18:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">literally. So that's probably the biggest source of slaves. Another big source is just children of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4722" target="_blank">01:18:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">slaves or slaves. And some people could literally sell either themselves or their children into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4730" target="_blank">01:18:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">slavery due to economic necessity or privation or something. So as terrible as that sounds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4737" target="_blank">01:18:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a father could sell a child if he needed money. Once you were a slave though, the experience of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4747" target="_blank">01:19:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">slavery varied a lot because a lot of the slaves were agricultural slaves. So they would work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4755" target="_blank">01:19:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like in the American South, big plantations, they might be chained, they were probably abused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4761" target="_blank">01:19:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's very similar to slavery as we think of it in, let's say, the Caribbean, South America,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4765" target="_blank">01:19:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">or the United States prior to the Civil War, that kind of slavery. But a lot of Roman slaves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4770" target="_blank">01:19:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">were also some of the more skilled people. And this seems a little weird. So if you're a rich</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4776" target="_blank">01:19:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">person, you have slaves, it's actually a good investment for you to train your slaves in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4780" target="_blank">01:19:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">profession. So a lot of Roman doctors, scribes, accountants, all this sort of thing, barbers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4789" target="_blank">01:19:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">were slaves. Because if you train this person and then they produce a lot of money for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you get that money. And those slaves would sometimes be given an incentive to work hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4801" target="_blank">01:20:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where they could, and this is just an agreement between the master and the slave, if they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4805" target="_blank">01:20:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">earned a certain amount of money, X amount of money, they could then buy their own freedom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4811" target="_blank">01:20:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from the master. So this was your incentive to work harder if you were trained, let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4815" target="_blank">01:20:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as a doctor, I work really hard, I can buy myself out of slavery. Or a lot of masters would free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4821" target="_blank">01:20:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">their slaves and their wills. So when they died, they would say, "I manumit this slave and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4827" target="_blank">01:20:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">slave." So it was a weird institution in that it was, elements were just as horrible as what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4834" target="_blank">01:20:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">think of as slavery and just as exploitative. And like I say, the overall notion of slavery is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4838" target="_blank">01:20:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">intensely dehumanizing, but yet there was this wide range of types of slaves. And the odd thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4846" target="_blank">01:20:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is in the city of Rome, many of the worst jobs, so if you're just a laborer hauling crap around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4854" target="_blank">01:20:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the docks or things like that, you might well be a free person and a slave would hold a skilled job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that seems a little strange or counterintuitive to us, but you see how in the Roman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4866" target="_blank">01:21:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">economy, it sort of works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4868" target="_blank">01:21:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that could be one of the things that would be surprising to us coming from the modern day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4873" target="_blank">01:21:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to the ancient world is just the number of slaves. So you mentioned one of the things we don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=4878" target="_blank">01:21:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about is that most of the people are farmers.

And the next 100-year period, from 133 to 31 BC, is called the Late Roman Republic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5202" target="_blank">01:26:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's a time of nearly constant internal strife, ultimately culminating in multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5208" target="_blank">01:26:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">rounds of civil war. So Roman society literally breaks apart, turns on itself, and goes to war</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5217" target="_blank">01:26:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with itself over not equitably sharing the benefits of conquest and of empire. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5224" target="_blank">01:27:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a lesson about not sharing the benefits of something in a society, but concentrating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5229" target="_blank">01:27:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it in one little group.

So in the past, there was a lot of ideology of the state is more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">important than the person.

Well, by the Late Republic, you have a succession of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5257" target="_blank">01:27:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">strongmen. And it is a chain. So it goes, Marius, Sully, Pompey, Julius Caesar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5263" target="_blank">01:27:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">where each one pushes the boundaries of the Roman Republic a little bit, pushes at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5270" target="_blank">01:27:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">structures of the institutions of the Republic, and they're motivated by personal gain. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5276" target="_blank">01:27:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">putting themselves above the state. So at the same time, you have lots of groups unhappy in society,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5282" target="_blank">01:28:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you get these strongmen who are now undermining the institutions, chipping away at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5288" target="_blank">01:28:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that have been shared, things holding the state together. And in the end, they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5294" target="_blank">01:28:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">become so ambitious. They're like, "I don't care about the state.

So I mean, this is going to culminate, obviously, in Julius Caesar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5304" target="_blank">01:28:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">who does succeed in making himself dictator for life of the Roman Republic, which is tantamount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5311" target="_blank">01:28:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to king, and he gets assassinated for it.

And dictator is a traditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5466" target="_blank">01:31:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">office in the Roman state, but dictators were limited to no more than six months in power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5471" target="_blank">01:31:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And Caesar says, "Well, I'll be dictator for life," which of course is king.

He named a month after himself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5516" target="_blank">01:31:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">July, Julius.

Is it going to be Octavian? So now looking back at all that history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5673" target="_blank">01:34:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it just feels like history turns on so many interesting accidents, because Octavian,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5679" target="_blank">01:34:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">later renamed Augustus, turned out to be actually, depends how you define good, but a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5686" target="_blank">01:34:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">king/emperor, different than Caesar in terms of humility, at least being able to play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5695" target="_blank">01:34:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not to piss off everybody.

That could have been the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5701" target="_blank">01:35:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fall of Rome. So it's a fascinating little turn of history. Maybe Caesar saw something in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5707" target="_blank">01:35:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">individual. It's not an accident that he was in the will. Yeah. I mean, Caesar clearly did see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5713" target="_blank">01:35:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">something in him. And Octavian, I mean, to cut to the end, is the one who emerges from all that as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5720" target="_blank">01:35:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the victor. We can talk about how he does it, but he's the one who sort of ends up in the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5724" target="_blank">01:35:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">position as Caesar. It takes him 30 years, but he defeats all the foes. He's the sole guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5729" target="_blank">01:35:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He now faces Caesar's riddle.

So he basically defeats Mark Antony partially by waging a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5761" target="_blank">01:36:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">propaganda war against him. I mean, Antony starts out as a legitimate rival, and there are two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5767" target="_blank">01:36:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans vying for power. At the end of this war, propaganda war, Octavian has managed to portray</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5774" target="_blank">01:36:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Antony as a foreign aggressor allied with an enemy king or queen, in this case, Cleopatra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5782" target="_blank">01:36:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and who is an official enemy of the Roman state. And that's all propaganda. So he takes what's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5787" target="_blank">01:36:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">civil war and makes it look like a war against a foreign enemy. And when Octavian becomes the sole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5794" target="_blank">01:36:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">ruler, he looks at what Caesar did wrong, and he very carefully avoids the same mistakes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5800" target="_blank">01:36:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing is just how he lives his life. He's very modest. He lives in an ordinary house</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5806" target="_blank">01:36:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like other aristocrats.

He treats them with respect. He eats simple foods. I mean, he's someone who cared about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5816" target="_blank">01:36:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the reality of power, not the external trappings. Clearly, there are some rulers who love, "I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5822" target="_blank">01:37:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to dress in fancy clothes.

This is what makes me feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5826" target="_blank">01:37:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">good." Octavian's the opposite. He doesn't care about any of that. He wants real power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5831" target="_blank">01:37:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other thing is, how is he going to rule Rome without looking like a king?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5835" target="_blank">01:37:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And his solution to this is brilliant. He basically pretends to resign from all his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5842" target="_blank">01:37:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">public offices.

So the highest office in the Roman state is the consul. Consuls have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5860" target="_blank">01:37:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the power to command armies, do all sorts of things, run meetings of the Senate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5864" target="_blank">01:37:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Octavian gets voted the powers of a consul.

So the state, the Republic, appears to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5891" target="_blank">01:38:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">continue as it always has.

Octavian, we even have a source that talks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5933" target="_blank">01:38:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. He says he wondered what to call himself. Do I call myself king? No, I can't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5938" target="_blank">01:38:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Dictator for life? No way. Maybe I'll call myself Romulus. That was the founder of Rome. No, no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5942" target="_blank">01:39:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Romulus was a king. And finally, a solution is he takes a bunch of titles, which are all ambiguous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5950" target="_blank">01:39:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and no one of them sounds that impressive, but collectively, they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5956" target="_blank">01:39:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, one of the titles he gets is Augustus, which is something tied to Roman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5961" target="_blank">01:39:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">religion. Something that is Augustus in Latin has two possible meanings. One is someone who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5968" target="_blank">01:39:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Augustus is very pious. They respect the gods deeply. Well, that sounds nice, doesn't it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5974" target="_blank">01:39:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, on the other hand, an alternative meaning for Augustus is something that is itself divine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5978" target="_blank">01:39:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So is he just a deeply religious, pious person, or is he himself sacred? There's that ambiguity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5987" target="_blank">01:39:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">He calls himself princeps, which means first citizen. Okay. What the hell does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5993" target="_blank">01:39:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I a citizen just like everybody else, or am I the first citizen, which means I'm superior to all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=5999" target="_blank">01:39:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the others? So every title he takes has this weird ambiguity. He calls himself imperator,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6005" target="_blank">01:40:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is traditionally something that soldiers shout at a victorious general who's won a battle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6011" target="_blank">01:40:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And now he takes this as a permanent title. So it implies he's a good general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6016" target="_blank">01:40:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, it's from imperator that we get the word emperor and empire. So originally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6021" target="_blank">01:40:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a military title, a spontaneous military acclamation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6025" target="_blank">01:40:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just fascinating that he figured out a way through public image, through branding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6030" target="_blank">01:40:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to gain power, maintain power, and still pacify the boiling turmoil that led to the civil wars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6044" target="_blank">01:40:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Well, two things I think work in his favor as well. One is he brings peace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6049" target="_blank">01:40:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and stability. So by this point, the Romans have experienced 100 years almost of civil war</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6056" target="_blank">01:40:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and chaos. So at that point, your family, maybe you've had family members die in these wars or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6062" target="_blank">01:41:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">been prescribed, your property has been confiscated, who knows what. And here's a guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6067" target="_blank">01:41:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">who brings peace and stability and doesn't seem oppressive or cruel or whatever. So you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6072" target="_blank">01:41:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, fine. I don't care. Maybe he's killed the Republic, but at least we're not dying in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6078" target="_blank">01:41:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">streets anymore. So that's a big thing he does. And secondly, even though Augustus always seemed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6084" target="_blank">01:41:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of sickly, his constitution, he lives forever. He rules for like 50 years. And by the time he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6092" target="_blank">01:41:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">dies, there's no one literally almost left alive who can remember the Republic. So at that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6099" target="_blank">01:41:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">by the time he dies, this is the only system we know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6102" target="_blank">01:41:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's another just fascinating accident of history. Because as we talked about with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6109" target="_blank">01:41:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Alexander the Great, who knows if he lived for another 40 years. If over time, the people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6117" target="_blank">01:41:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hate the new thing die off and then their sons come into power, that could be a very different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6125" target="_blank">01:42:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">story. Maybe we'll be talking about the Greek Empire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6126" target="_blank">01:42:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a fluke of fate, but it's hugely influential on history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6129" target="_blank">01:42:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned Cleopatra. If we go back to that, what role did she play?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6133" target="_blank">01:42:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Another fascinating human being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6136" target="_blank">01:42:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Cleopatra is interesting. I mean, she was a direct descendant of one of Alexander the Great's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6144" target="_blank">01:42:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">generals, Ptolemy.

So Egypt had been ruled by, in essence, foreigners, these Macedonian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6163" target="_blank">01:42:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">dynasty of kings. And often, they literally were ruled by the same dynasty because they had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6167" target="_blank">01:42:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">habit of marrying brothers to sisters. And Cleopatra is, in fact, originally married to her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6173" target="_blank">01:42:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">younger brother. But despite that, she seems to have intensely identified with Egypt. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6182" target="_blank">01:43:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">she seems to have been the first one of all these Ptolemy kings who actually bothered to learn to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6187" target="_blank">01:43:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">speak Egyptian.

And she was clearly very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6194" target="_blank">01:43:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">smart, very clever.

And this one seems pretty genuine. I mean, Antony and Cleopatra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6272" target="_blank">01:44:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of stories about them kind of partying together.

But as I mentioned, off to the side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6918" target="_blank">01:55:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you now have this figure of Augustus who sort of controls everything behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6922" target="_blank">01:55:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that continues. So this political system he establishes continues. And in reality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6930" target="_blank">01:55:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say Augustus at that point is again a king. It really is one man controlling the state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6937" target="_blank">01:55:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">even if notionally, it's still continuing as a republic. They are electing magistrates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6942" target="_blank">01:55:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but the magistrates only do what the emperor tells them, right?

Did you become a king?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=6960" target="_blank">01:56:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, and he says this explicitly, "No, no, no.

He says, "If I've played my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7193" target="_blank">01:59:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">part well, dismiss me from the stage with applause."

He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7205" target="_blank">02:00:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was brilliant at that, but who's the real guy?

So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7263" target="_blank">02:01:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a big chunk of Europe gets conquered, hundreds of thousands of people killed, hundreds of thousands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7269" target="_blank">02:01:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of people enslaved to further one guy's career.

But on the other hand, some people see him as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7281" target="_blank">02:01:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a great hero. I mean, to talk about history and its reception, it's quite interesting to see how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7286" target="_blank">02:01:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Caesar has been viewed by different generations. So at different points in time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7292" target="_blank">02:01:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the sort of received wisdom on Caesar is very different. So back in the, let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7298" target="_blank">02:01:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the 1920s or '30s, there were a number of scholarly things written, which kind of looked at Caesar as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7303" target="_blank">02:01:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">an admirable figure.

He's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7326" target="_blank">02:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">dictator. He's destroying the republic. So often, histories that are written tell you a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7332" target="_blank">02:02:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about the time they're written than they do about the subject they're written about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7336" target="_blank">02:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we know, what did Hitler or Stalin think about the Roman Empire?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7342" target="_blank">02:02:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, certainly, they borrow a lot of the trappings. I mean, Nazi Germany borrows a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7347" target="_blank">02:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of iconography from ancient Rome. I mean, they carried around little military standards with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7352" target="_blank">02:02:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">eagles on them, just like the Romans.

And I think Cicero is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7385" target="_blank">02:03:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting for a couple of reasons.

I think we have almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7390" target="_blank">02:03:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">more words from Cicero than any other author that survived.

You learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7773" target="_blank">02:09:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">how to project your voice.

So I looked at the rhetorical handbooks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7790" target="_blank">02:09:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Cicero's, and also there's this guy Quintilian, who lived about 100 years after Cicero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7795" target="_blank">02:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">who wrote this long thing called the Institutio Oratoria, which has a description of all types</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7801" target="_blank">02:10:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of oratorical stuff, including about 40 pages on gestures. So he actually says, "When you put your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7806" target="_blank">02:10:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">fingers like this, it means such and such." And it turns out Roman orators had a system of sign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7811" target="_blank">02:10:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">language that they would use to augment their speeches.

It wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=7817" target="_blank">02:10:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like modern American sign language, where a gesture means the same thing as a word.

And in some ways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8812" target="_blank">02:26:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, it is sort of a threat to the Roman system because they're challenging it. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8816" target="_blank">02:26:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the irony is, of course, 300 years after the life of Christ, the emperor converts to Christianity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8823" target="_blank">02:27:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and another 100 years later under Theodosius, it becomes the official religion of the Roman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8828" target="_blank">02:27:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">empire. So all of a sudden, you have this flip-flop where now the state itself is not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8834" target="_blank">02:27:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">converted to Christianity, but actively promoting it and now persecuting pagans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8839" target="_blank">02:27:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason the emperors do that is one of the biggest problems for emperors at that point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8847" target="_blank">02:27:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">in time is legitimacy, that there's tons of civil wars where you have lots of different people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8852" target="_blank">02:27:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "I'm emperor." So lots of generals declaring themselves emperor. Now, under a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8858" target="_blank">02:27:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">polytheistic religion, you're all just fighting, it doesn't matter. But if you say, "There is only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8866" target="_blank">02:27:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">one God," then if that God picks someone to be his emperor, they're the only legitimate emperor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8875" target="_blank">02:27:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So there is a real advantage to emperors now becoming Christian, because if they can say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8883" target="_blank">02:28:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">"We're now a Christian empire, and there's only one God, and I'm the guy that God picked to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8889" target="_blank">02:28:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">emperor," that means all these other people claiming to be emperors are illegitimate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8893" target="_blank">02:28:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Do you think that, or is there other factors that explain why Christianity was able to spread?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8899" target="_blank">02:28:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Well, I mean, that's why it's appealing to the emperors. And we're talking here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8903" target="_blank">02:28:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the religious answer is people see the light, right? It's a faith-based thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8909" target="_blank">02:28:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking at this as a historian. So putting aside religious feeling and saying, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8914" target="_blank">02:28:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">if I'm doing an analysis of this as a social phenomenon, what would be appealing to people?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8920" target="_blank">02:28:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is that very compelling reason for emperors to want to go to Christianity, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8925" target="_blank">02:28:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">it helps them with their biggest problem, which is legitimacy. Now, if you're an ordinary person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8930" target="_blank">02:28:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the appeal of Christianity? Well, we already looked at a couple of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8934" target="_blank">02:28:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them is that it promises you a reward in the afterlife. I mean, the Roman and Greek notions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8940" target="_blank">02:29:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of the afterlife aren't that appealing. Either you just sort of turn into dust, or at best,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8945" target="_blank">02:29:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you turn into this kind of ghost thing that floats around something that looks like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8949" target="_blank">02:29:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Greek gymnasium, which is like a bunch of grassy fields. It's not so hot. So here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8955" target="_blank">02:29:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you're offered the idea of like, "Oh, you go to paradise forever. That sounds really good."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8959" target="_blank">02:29:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And secondly, for a lot of people in Roman society, that notion of, "Here's something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8964" target="_blank">02:29:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">says I'm valuable as a human being. It doesn't matter whether I'm free or slave. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8969" target="_blank">02:29:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">matter whether I'm Roman or non-Roman. It doesn't matter if I'm a man or woman. Here's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8973" target="_blank">02:29:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that says I have equal value." That's enormously appealing. And finally, early Christians, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8978" target="_blank">02:29:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">they honestly, a lot of them do good works. They take care of the sick. They feed the poor. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8984" target="_blank">02:29:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, that's the stuff he really hammers. If we look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8989" target="_blank">02:29:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the words of Jesus when he says, "What do you do to be a Christian?" a lot of it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=8992" target="_blank">02:29:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">"Take care of the unfortunate.

And a lot of the early Christians really take that seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9003" target="_blank">02:30:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So they are helping people out.

But if you work for someone else, you're demeaning yourself. And gladiators are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9116" target="_blank">02:31:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">worst of the worst, right? You're performing for someone else's pleasure. So on the one hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9120" target="_blank">02:32:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">they're very low status. But on the other hand, successful gladiators get famous. People admire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9126" target="_blank">02:32:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">them. Women find them attractive. They're celebrities.

You have these people who on the one hand, formally are very low status in society,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9140" target="_blank">02:32:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but yet are very popular on the other hand. Another kind of myth about gladiators is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9145" target="_blank">02:32:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">they were just dying all the time.

So I think in all eras, you have a diversity of opinions. There's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9318" target="_blank">02:35:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">unanimous take on what this is or what this means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9322" target="_blank">02:35:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So who usually wore the gladiators?

Was it-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9326" target="_blank">02:35:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Well, the most common source, again, is prisoners of war. So if you conquer some people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9331" target="_blank">02:35:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and they seem to be warlike, you might well consign some of them to fight in the arena.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9336" target="_blank">02:35:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other thing about gladiators is they were highly trained professionals.

I mean, in very rare instances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9363" target="_blank">02:36:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you might have a free person volunteering or even selling themselves to fight as gladiators, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9369" target="_blank">02:36:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">much more common was that. And what's interesting is some people wouldn't do it. I mean, there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9375" target="_blank">02:36:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of instances of gladiators refusing to fight and committing suicide, which you don't hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9379" target="_blank">02:36:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was one German who was supposed to fight as a gladiator, and instead he stuck his head</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9386" target="_blank">02:36:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">between the spokes of a wagon that was spinning and snapped his own neck.

So during the reign of the Emperor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9470" target="_blank">02:37:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Vespasian. And he built this thing. So he built the Flavian Amphitheater. He was from the Flavian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9476" target="_blank">02:37:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">family of emperors. And he did it as a deliberate act of propaganda. So before him had been Nero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9485" target="_blank">02:38:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">who was sort of seen as a crazy or bad emperor. And one of Nero's indulgences is he had built this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9493" target="_blank">02:38:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">enormous palace for himself called the Golden House. So it was kind of this pleasure palace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9498" target="_blank">02:38:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">with 50 dining rooms and all this stuff.

So it was very much a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9516" target="_blank">02:38:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">political statement that my dynasty is going to be about serving Romans, not serving ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9522" target="_blank">02:38:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why he builds the Flavian Amphitheater.

And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9539" target="_blank">02:38:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what he now builds in Rome as his gift to the people of Rome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9544" target="_blank">02:39:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's interesting to think about that place, to think about their relationship with violence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9549" target="_blank">02:39:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">across centuries for spectacle, watching people fight.

But I read that still a lot of people died. A lot of gladiators were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9566" target="_blank">02:39:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">killed. There's numbers that are just crazy. I mean, I read 400,000 dead. So this includes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9573" target="_blank">02:39:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">gladiators, slaves, convicts, prisoners, and so on.

And the Romans, I mean, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9654" target="_blank">02:40:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't invent concrete, but they just used it more creatively than anyone had before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=9660" target="_blank">02:41:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at buildings like the Greeks built, they're all rectilinear.

There's big changes, planes when they become a huge force. I mean, World War II is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=11939" target="_blank">03:18:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this crazy time where planes go from literally biplanes, string and wood to jets four years later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=11949" target="_blank">03:19:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's this moment of incredibly fast technological change.

For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=12794" target="_blank">03:33:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">all the literary texts are written by one tiny group, elite males.

I mean, all those texts are copies of copies of copies of copies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=12816" target="_blank">03:33:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And everybody knows that game where you whisper a sentence to someone and then go around the room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=12820" target="_blank">03:33:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">are you gonna get that same sentence back?

So that's a salutary example, I think, of the dangers of interpreting physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=12994" target="_blank">03:36:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">evidence when you don't have written evidence to go along with it. And think today. If our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13000" target="_blank">03:36:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">civilization were to blow up in a nuclear war and archaeologists were to dig this up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13005" target="_blank">03:36:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">how might they misinterpret things? I mean, if they were to dig up a college dorm where I work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13013" target="_blank">03:36:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what you had for this civilization. You'd probably go in the dorm rooms. You'd find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13018" target="_blank">03:36:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">all these little rooms. And maybe in every room, you'd find this mysterious plastic disc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13023" target="_blank">03:37:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everybody has these. So it must be a cult object. And it's round. So obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13029" target="_blank">03:37:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">they're sun worshipers. And if you can decipher the inscription, you'll see that obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13033" target="_blank">03:37:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">they all worship the great sun god Wham-O. It's like, what do you find in every dorm room? A</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13039" target="_blank">03:37:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Frisbee. So that's the level of interpretation you have to beware of. And there's examples where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13046" target="_blank">03:37:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we've done exactly this. So we have to have intellectual humility when we look back into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13051" target="_blank">03:37:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the past. But hopefully, if you have that without coming up with really strong narratives, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13058" target="_blank">03:37:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">look at a large variety of evidence, you can start to construct a picture that somewhat rhymes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13065" target="_blank">03:37:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">with the truth.

You attempt to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13071" target="_blank">03:37:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">reconstruct an image of the past that is faithful to the evidence you have as filtered through what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13079" target="_blank">03:37:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you can perceive of both the biases and the problems of the source material and your own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13085" target="_blank">03:38:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">biases. And it's a interpretation. It's a reconstruction. But it's a lot like science</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13091" target="_blank">03:38:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're in a process of constantly reevaluating it and saying, okay, here's some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13095" target="_blank">03:38:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">new evidence. How do I work this into the picture? How do I now adjust it? And that's what's fun. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13101" target="_blank">03:38:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, it's a mystery.

And it's even more fun where it's, yeah, you have to try to empathize. Empathy is a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13113" target="_blank">03:38:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">human thing, to empathize with people who are not yourself. And we should do this all the time with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13119" target="_blank">03:38:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">just the people we encounter, but this is what we're doing with ancient civilizations. And as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY&t=13123" target="_blank">03:38:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked about earlier, sometimes you'll feel great sympathy there.
