No one comes to the Father, but through me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwwzodhWysY&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you come to see Jesus, the Son, you see the God that he reveals is a Father, eternally a Father, eternally, therefore, one who has a relationship, who loves his Son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwwzodhWysY&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that sort of thing, Jesus says in John 17, 24, Father, you loved me before the foundation of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwwzodhWysY&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't something that started at some point.
