He is abundant in power. His understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz-EgGIXFJ8&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is beyond measure, Psalm 147.5. "The Almighty, we cannot find Him.

"I know that you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz-EgGIXFJ8&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">O God, can do all things, and no purpose of yours can be thwarted," Job 42.2. Isaiah 46,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz-EgGIXFJ8&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">God himself puts it like this, "I am God, and there is no other.
