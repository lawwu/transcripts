On the other hand, you have an explosion of innovation in AI. And so what happened with both TensorFlow and PyTorch is that the explosion of innovation in AI has led to, it's not just about matrix multiplication and convolution. These things have now like 2,000 different operators. And on the other hand, you have, I don't know how many pieces of hardware there are out there. It's a lot. Part of my thesis, part of my belief of where computing goes, if you look out 10 years from now, is it's not going to get simpler. Physics isn't going back to where we came from. It's only going to get weirder from here on out. And so to me, the exciting part about what we're building is it's about building that universal platform, which the world can continue to get weird, because again, I don't think it's avoidable. It's physics. But we can help lift people, scale, do things with it. And they don't have to rewrite their code every time a new device comes out. And I think that's pretty cool. The following is a conversation with Chris Ladner, his third time on this podcast. As I've said many times before, he's one of the most brilliant engineers in modern computing, having created LLM Compiler Infrastructure Project, the Clang Compiler, the Swift Programming Language, a lot of key contributions to TensorFlow and TPUs as part of Google. He served as vice president of autopilot software at Tesla, was a software innovator and leader at Apple, and now he co-created a new full-stack AI infrastructure, for distributed training, inference and deployment on all kinds of hardware called modular, and a new programming language called Mojo. That is a super set of Python, giving you all the usability of Python, but with the performance of C/C++. In many cases, Mojo code has demonstrated over 30,000x speedup over Python. If you love machine learning, if you love Python, you should definitely give Mojo a try. The next thing I want to talk about is the technology. The technology is the most advanced technology in the world. The technology is the most advanced technology in the world. This programming language, this new AI framework and infrastructure, and this conversation with Chris is mind-blowing. I love it. It gets pretty technical at times, so I hope you hang on for the ride. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Chris Ladner. It's been, I think, two years since we last talked, and in that time, you somehow went and co-created a new podcast.

So this kind of self-building loop is interesting to understand So this kind of self-building loop is interesting to understand because when you look at Mojo, what it stands for, because when you look at Mojo, what it stands for, some of the features, it seems sort of clear that this is a good direction some of the features, it seems sort of clear that this is a good direction for programming languages to evolve in the machine learning community. for programming languages to evolve in the machine learning community. But it's still not obvious that it will, because of this, whatever the engine of popularity, of virality. because of this, whatever the engine of popularity, of virality. because of this, whatever the engine of popularity, of virality. Is there something you could speak to? Like how do you get people to start to understand Mojo? Like how do you get people to start to understand Mojo? Yeah, well I mean, I think that the viral growth loop is to switch people to Unicode. I think the Unicode file extensions are what I'm betting on. I think that's going to be the thing. Tell the kids that you can use the fire emoji Tell the kids that you can use the fire emoji and they'd be like, "What?" Well, in all seriousness, I think there's really, I'll give you two opposite answers. One is, I hope if it's useful, if it solves problems, and if people care about those problems being solved, they'll adopt the technology. That's kind of the simple answer. That's kind of the simple answer. When you're looking to get tech adopted, the question is, is it solving an important problem people need solved? And is the adoption cost low enough that they're willing to make the switch and cut over and do the pain up front so that they can actually do it? And so hopefully Mojo will be that for a bunch of people. And people building these hybrid packages are suffering. It's really painful. And so I think that we have a good shot of helping people. But the other side is, it's okay if people don't use Mojo. It's not my job to say, "Everybody should do this." I'm not saying Python is bad. I hope Cpython, all these implementations, because the Python ecosystem is not just Cpython, it's also a bunch of different implementations with different trade-offs. And this ecosystem is really powerful and exciting, as are other programming languages. It's not like TypeScript or something is going to go away. There's not a winner-take-all thing. And so I hope that Mojo is exciting and useful to people, and if it's not, that's also fine. But I also wonder what the use case for why you should try Mojo would be. So practically speaking, it seems like there's entertainment, there's the dopamine hit of saying, "Holy shit, this is ten times faster." This little piece of code is ten times faster in Mojo. Out of the box before you get to 35,000. Exactly. I mean, that's the dopamine hit that every programmer sort of dreams of, is the optimization. It's also the drug that can pull you in and have you waste way too much of your life optimizing and over-optimizing. But so what do you see would be like commonly? It's very hard to predict, of course, but if you look 10 years from now and Mojo's super successful, what do you think would be the thing where people try it and then use it regularly and it kind of grows and grows and grows? Well, so you talk about dopamine hit. Again, humans are not one thing. Some people love rewriting their code and learning new things and throwing themselves in the deep end and trying out a new thing. In my experience, most people don't. Like, they're too busy. They have other things going on. By number, most people don't like this, "I want to rewrite all my code." But even those people the too busy people, the people that don't actually care about the language or just care about getting stuff done, those people do like learning new things. Right? And so you talk about the dopamine rush of 10x faster. "Wow, that's cool. I want to do that again." Well, it's also like, "Here's a thing I've heard about in a different domain, and now I don't have to rewrite all my code. I can learn a new trick." Right? Well, that's called growth. You know? And so one thing that I think is cool about Mojo and, again, this will take a little bit of time for, for example, the blog posts and the books and all that kind of stuff to develop and the language needs to get further along, but what we're doing, you talk about types, you can say, "Look, you can start with the world you already know, and you can progressively learn new things and adopt them where it makes sense." If you never do that, that's cool. You're not a bad person. If you get really excited about it and want to go all the way in the deep end and rewrite everything and whatever, that's cool. Right? But I think the middle path is actually the more likely one, where it's, you know, you come out with a new idea and you discover, "Wow, that makes my code way simpler, way more beautiful, way faster, way whatever." And I think that's what people like. Now, if you fast forward and you said, like, 10 years out, right? I can give you a very different answer on that, which is, I mean, if you go back and look at what computers looked like 20 years ago, every 18 months they got faster for free. Right? 2x faster every 18 months, it was like clockwork. It was free, right? You go back 10 years ago, and we entered in this world where suddenly we had multi-core CPUs and we had GPUs. And if you squint and turn your head, what a GPU is, it's just a mini-core, very simple CPU thing, kind of, right? And so, 10 years ago, it was CPUs and GPUs and graphics. Today, we have CPUs, GPUs, graphics, and AI. Because it's so important, because the compute is so demanding, because of the smart cameras and the watches and the all the different places that AI needs to work in our lives, it's caused this explosion of hardware. And so, part of my thesis, part of my belief of where computing goes, if you look out 10 years from now, is it's not going to get simpler. Physics isn't going back to where we came from, it's only going to get weirder from here on out. Right? And so, to me, the exciting part about what we're building is it's about building that universal platform, which the world can continue to get weird, because again, I don't think it's avoidable, it's physics, but we can help lift people, scale, do things with it, and they don't have to rewrite their code every time a new device comes out. And I think that's pretty cool. And so, if Mojo can help with that problem, then I think that it will be hopefully quite interesting and quite useful to a wide range of people, because there's so much potential and like there's so much, you know, maybe analog computers will become a thing or something, right? And we need to be able to get into a mode where we can move this programming model forward, but do so in a way where we're lifting people and growing them, instead of forcing them to rewrite all their code and exploding them. Do you think there'll be a few major libraries that go Mojo first? Well, so I mean, the modular engine's all Mojo. So, again, come back to, like, we're not building Mojo because it's fun, we're building Mojo because we had to to solve these accelerators. That's the origin story. But I mean ones that are currently in Python. Yeah, so I think that a number of these projects will. And so one of the things, again, this is just my best guess, like, each of the package maintainers also has, I'm sure, plenty of other things going on. People don't, like, really don't like rewriting code just for the sake of rewriting code. But sometimes, like, people are excited about, like, adopting a new idea. It turns out that while rewriting code is generally not people's first thing, it turns out that redesigning something while you rewrite it and using a rewrite as an excuse to redesign can lead to the 2.0 of your thing that's way better than the 1.0. And so, I have no idea. I can't predict that. But there's a lot of these places where, again, if you have a package that is half C and half Python, right, you just solve the pain, make it easier to move things faster, make it easier to debug and evolve your tech, adopting Mojo kind of makes sense to start with. And then it gives you this opportunity to rethink these things. So the two big gains are that there's a performance gain, and then there's the portability to all kinds of different devices. And there's safety, right? So you talk about real types. I mean, not saying this is for everybody, but that's actually a pretty big thing. And so there's a bunch of different aspects of what value Mojo provides. And so, I mean, it's funny for me. Like, I've been working on these kinds of technologies and tools for too many years now. But you look at Swift, right? And we talked about Swift for TensorFlow, but Swift as a programming language, right? Swift's now 13 years old from when I started it. Because I started in 2010, if I remember. And so, that project, and I was involved with it for 12 years or something, right? That project has gone through its own really interesting story arc, right? And it's a mature, successful, used by millions of people system, right? Certainly not dead yet, right? But also, going through that story arc, I learned a tremendous amount about building languages, about building compilers, about working with community, and things like this. And so, that experience, like I'm helping channel and bring directly into Mojo. And other systems, same thing. Like, apparently, I like building and iterating and evolving things. And so, you look at this LLVM thing I worked on 20 years ago, and you look at MLIR, right? And so, a lot of the lessons learned in LLVM got fed into MLIR. And I think that MLIR is a way better system than LLVM was. And, you know, Swift is a really good system, and it's amazing. But I hope that Mojo will take the next step forward in terms of design. In terms of running Mojo, people can play with it. What's Mojo play? It's a playground. And from the interface perspective, and from the hardware perspective, what's this incredible thing running on? Yeah, so right now, so here we are two weeks after launch. We decided that, okay, we have this incredible set of technology that we think might be good, but we have not given it to lots of people yet. And so we were very conservative and said, let's put it in a workbook so that if it crashes we can do something about it. We can monitor and track that, right? And so, again, things are still super early, but we're having, like, one person a minute sign up with over 70,000 people two weeks in. It's kind of crazy. So you can sign up to Mojo Playground and you can use it in the cloud. Yeah. In your browser. And so what that's running on, right? Yeah, what that's running on is that's running on cloud VMs. And so you share a machine with a bunch of other people, but it turns out there's a bunch of them now because there's a lot of people. And so, what you're doing is you're getting free compute and you're getting to play with this thing in kind of a limited, controlled way so that we can make sure that it doesn't totally crash and be embarrassing. So, now a lot of the feedback we've gotten is people want to download it locally, so we're working on that right now. So that's the goal, to be able to download it locally? Yeah, that's what everybody expects. And so we're working on that right now. And so we just want to make sure that we do it right. I think this is one of the lessons I learned from Swift also, by the way, is that when we launched Swift, gosh, it feels like forever ago, it was 2014, and we, I mean, it was super exciting. I and we, the team, had worked on Swift for a number of years in secrecy. And we, four years into this development, roughly, of working on this thing, at that point about 250 people at Apple knew about it. So it was secret. Apple's good at secrecy, and it was a secret project. And so we launched this at WWDC, a bunch of hoopla and excitement, and said, "Developers, you're going to be able to develop and submit apps to the App Store in three months." Well, several interesting things happened, right? So first of all, we learned that, A, it had a lot of bugs. And it was not actually production quality. And it was extremely stressful in terms of trying to get it working for a bunch of people. And so what happened was we went from zero to, you know, I don't know how many developers Apple had at the time, but a lot of developers overnight. And they ran into a lot of bugs, and it was really embarrassing, and it was very stressful for everybody involved. It was also very exciting, because everybody was excited about that. The other thing I learned is that when that happened, roughly every software engineer who did not know about the project at Apple, their head exploded when it was launched, because they didn't know it was coming. And so they're like, "Wait, what is this? I signed up to work for Apple because I love Objective-C. Why is there a new thing?" And so now what that meant, practically, is that the push from launch to, first of all, the fall, but then to 2.0 and 3.0 and like all the way forward, was super painful for the engineering team and myself. It was very stressful. The developer community was very grumpy about it, because they're like, "Okay, well, wait a second. You're changing and breaking my code, and like we have to fix the bugs." And it was just like a lot of tension and friction on all sides. There's a lot of technical debt in the compiler, because we have to run really fast, and you have to go implement the thing and unblock the use case and do the thing, and you know it's not right, but you never have time to go back and do it right. And I'm very proud of the Swift team, because they've come I mean, we, but they came so far and made so much progress over this time since launch. It's pretty incredible, and Swift is a very, very good thing. But I just don't want to do that again. Right? And so... So, iterate more through the development process. Yeah. And so what we're doing is we're not launching it when it's hopefully 0.9 with no testers. We're launching it and saying it's 0.1. Right? And so we're setting expectations and saying like, okay, well, don't use this for production. Right? If you're interested in what we're doing, we'll do it in an open way, and we can do it together, but don't use it in production yet. Like, we'll get there, but let's do it the right way. And I'm also saying we're not in a race. The thing that I want to do is build the world's best thing. Yeah. Right? Because if you do it right and it lifts the industry, it doesn't matter if it takes an extra two months. Yeah. Like, two months is worth waiting. And so doing it right and not being overwhelmed with technical debt and things like this is like, again, war wounds, lessons learned, whatever you want to say, I think is absolutely the right thing to do, even though right now people are very frustrated that, you know, you can't download it or it doesn't have feature X or something like this. What have you learned in a little bit of time since it's been released into the wild that people have been complaining about feature X or Y or Z? What have they been complaining about? What they have been excited about, like, almost like detailed things versus big vision. I think everyone would be very excited about the big vision. Yeah, yeah. Well, so, I mean, I've been very pleased. In fact, I mean, we've been massively overwhelmed with response, which is a good problem to have. It's kind of like a success disaster in a sense, right? And so, I mean, if you go back in time, when we started Modular, which was just not yet a year and a half ago, so it's still a pretty new company, new team, small but very good team of people. Like, we started with extreme conviction that there's a set of problems that we need to solve, and if we solve it, then people will be interested in what we're doing, right? But again, you're building in basically secret, right? You're trying to figure it out. Creation's a messy process. You're having to go through different paths and understand what you want to do and how to explain it. Often when you're doing disruptive and new kinds of things, just knowing how to explain it is super difficult, right? And so, when we launched, we hoped people would be excited, but you know, I'm an optimist, but I'm also, like, don't want to get ahead of myself. And so, when people found out about Mojo, I think their heads exploded a little bit. And, you know, here's, I think, a pretty credible team that has built some languages and some tools before, and so they have some lessons learned and are tackling some of the deep problems in the Python ecosystem and giving it the love and attention that it should be getting. And I think people got very excited about that. And so, if you look at that, I mean, I think people are excited about ownership and taking a step beyond Rust, right? And there's people that are very excited about that. And there's people that are excited about, you know, just, like, I made Game of Life go 400 times faster. Right? And things like that. And that's really cool. There are people that are really excited about the, "Okay, I really hate writing stuff in C++. Save me." Like, systems in your, they're, like, stepping up, like, "Oh, yes." Yeah, yeah. So, that's me, by the way. Also, I really want to stop writing C++. But the I get third-person excitement when people tweet "Here, I made this code, Game of Life," or whatever, faster. And you're like, "Yeah." Yeah, and also, like, I would also say that, let me cast blame out to people who deserve it. Sure. These terrible people who convinced me to do some of this. Yes. Jeremy Howard. Yes. That guy. Well, he's been pushing for this kind of thing. He's been pushing for a long time. He's wanted this for years! Yeah, he's wanted this for a long, long time. He's wanted this for years! For people who don't know Jeremy Howard, he's, like, one of the most legit people in the machine learning community. He's, uh, he's at grassroots. He really teaches. He's an incredible educator. He's an incredible teacher, but also legit, in terms of a machine learning engineer himself. Yeah, so... And he's been running the Fast.ai and looking, I think, for exactly what you've done. Exactly. And so, I mean, the first time... So, I met Jeremy pretty early on. But the first time I sat up and I'm like, "This guy is ridiculous," is when I was at Google, and we were bringing up TPUs, and we had a whole team of people, and we're... There was this competition called "Dawn Bench," of who can train ImageNet fastest. Right? Yes. And Jeremy and one of his researchers crushed Google. Not through sheer force of the amazing amount of compute and the number of TPUs and stuff like that. He just decided that progressive imagery sizing was the right way to train the model in fewer epochs faster and make the whole thing go vroom, right? And I'm like, "This guy is incredible." And so you can say... Anyways, come back to where's Mojo coming from. Chris finally listened to Jeremy. It's all his fault. Well, there's a kind of very refreshing, pragmatic view that he has about machine learning that, I don't know if... It's like this mix of a desire for efficiency, but ultimately grounded in a desire to make machine learning more accessible to a lot of people. I don't know what that is. I guess that's coupled with efficiency and performance, but it's not just obsessed about performance. So a lot of AI and AI research ends up being that it has to go fast enough to get scale. So a lot of people don't actually care about performance, particularly on the research side, until it allows them to have more... A bigger data set. So suddenly now you care about distributed compute and all these exotic HPC... You don't actually want to know about that. You just want to be able to do more experiments faster and do so with bigger data sets. And so Jeremy has been really pushing the limits. And one of the things I'll say about Jeremy, and there's many things I could say about Jeremy because I'm a fanboy of his, but he fits in his head. And Jeremy actually takes the time, where many people don't, to really dive deep into why is the beta parameter of the atom optimizer equal to this. And he'll go survey and understand what are all the activation functions and the trade-offs and why is it that everybody that does this model pick that thing. So the why, not just trying different values, like really what is going on here. And so as a consequence of that, he's always, again, he makes time, but he spends time to understand things at a depth that a lot of people don't. And as you say, he then brings it and teaches people how to do it. And his mission is to help lift, you know, his website says, "Making AI Uncool Again." Like, it's about, like, forget about the hype, it's actually practical and useful. Let's teach people how to do this, right? Now the problem Jeremy struggled with is that he's pushing the envelope. Research isn't about doing the thing that is staying on the happy path, or the well-paved road, right? And so a lot of the systems today have been these really fragile, fragmented things or special case in this happy path. And if you fall off the happy path, you get eaten by an alligator. So what about, so Python has this giant ecosystem of packages and there's a package repository. Do you have ideas of how to do that well for Mojo? How to do a repository of packages? Well, so that's another really interesting problem that I knew about, but I didn't understand how big of a problem it was. Python packaging, a lot of people have very big pain points and a lot of scars with Python packaging. Oh, you mean, so there's several things to say. Building and distributing and managing dependencies and versioning and all this stuff. So from the perspective of if you want to create your own package. Yes. And then, or you want to build on top of a bunch of other people's packages and then they get updated and things like this. Now, I'm not an expert in this, so I don't know the answer. I think this is one of the reasons why it's great that we work as a team and there's other really good and smart people involved. But one of my one of the things I've heard from smart people who've done a lot of this is that the packaging becomes a huge disaster when you get the Python and C together. And so if you have this problem where you have code split between Python and C, now not only do you have to package the C code, you have to build the C code. C doesn't have a package manager, right? C doesn't have a dependency versioning management system, right? And so I'm not experienced in the state of the art and all the different Python package managers, but my understanding is that's a massive part of the problem. And I think Mojo solves that part of the problem directly heads on. Now, one of the things I think we'll do with the community, and this isn't again, we're not solving all the world's problems at once, we have to be kind of focused to start with, is that I think that we will have an opportunity to reevaluate packaging. And so I think that we can come back and say, okay, well given the new tools and technologies and the cool things we have that we've built up, because we have not just syntax, we have an entirely new compiler stack that works in a new way, maybe there's other innovations we can bring together and maybe we can help solve that problem. So almost a tangent to that question from the user perspective of packages, it was always surprising to me that it was not easier to sort of explore and find packages. You know, with pip install, it just, it feels, it's an incredible ecosystem. It's just interesting that it wasn't made, it's still, I think, not made easier to discover packages to do like search and discovery, as YouTube calls it. Well, I mean, it's kind of funny because this is one of the challenges of these like intentionally decentralized communities. And so I don't know what the right answer is for Python. I mean, there are many people that would, or I don't even know the right answer for Mojo. So there are many people that would have much more informed opinions than I do. But it's interesting if you look at this, right, open source communities, you know, there's Git. Git is a fully decentralized, anybody can do it any way they want, but then there's GitHub. Right, and GitHub centralized commercial in that case, right, thing, really helped pull together and help solve some of the discovery problems and help build a more consistent community. And so maybe there's opportunities for... For something like a GitHub for Python. Yeah. Although even GitHub, I might be wrong on this, but the search and discovery for GitHub is not that great. Like I still use Google search, Yeah, well, I mean, maybe that's because GitHub doesn't want to replace Google search. Right? I think there is room for specialized solutions to specific problems. Sure. I don't know the right answer for GitHub either. That's... They can go figure that out. But the point is to have an interface that's usable, that's accessible to people of all different skill levels. Well, and again, what are the benefits of standards, right? Standards allow you to build these next level up ecosystem, next level up infrastructure, next level up things. And so again, come back to... I hate complexity. C plus Python is complicated. It makes everything more difficult to deal with. It makes it difficult to port, move code around, work with. All these things get more complicated. And so I mean, I'm not an expert, but maybe Mojo can help a little bit by helping reduce the amount of C in this ecosystem and make it therefore scale better. So any kind of packages that are hybrid in nature would be a natural fit to move to Mojo. Which is a lot of them, by the way. Yeah. A lot of them, especially that are doing some interesting stuff computation-wise. Let me ask you about some features. Yeah. So we talked about, obviously, indentation, that it's a typed language or optionally typed. Is that the right way to say it? It's either optionally or progressively. Progressively. I think... So people have very strong opinions on the right word to use. Yeah. I don't know. I look forward to your letters. So there's the var versus let. But let is for constants. Yeah. var is an optional. Yeah, var makes it mutable, so you can reassign. Okay. Then there's function overloading. Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of source of happiness for me, but function overloading, that's... I guess, is that... Is that for performance? Or is that... Why does Python not have function overloading? So I can speculate. Python is a dynamic language. The way it works is that Python and Objective-C are actually very similar worlds if you ignore syntax. And so Objective-C is straight line derived from Smalltalk, a really venerable, interesting language that much of the world has forgotten about, but the people that remember it love it, generally. And the way that Smalltalk works is that every object has a dictionary in it. And the dictionary maps from the name of a function, or the name of a value within an object, to its implementation. And so the way you call a method in Objective-C is you say, "Go look up..." The way I call foo is I go look up foo, I get a pointer to the function back, and then I call it. That's how Python works. And so now the problem with that is that the dictionary within a Python object, all the keys are strings, and it's a dictionary, so you can only have one entry per name. You think it's as simple as that? I think it's as simple as that. And so, now, why do they never fix this like, why do they not change it to not be a dictionary? Why do they not change it to do other things? Well, you don't really have to in Python, because it's dynamic. And so you can say, "I get into the function, now if I got past an integer, do some dynamic tests for it. If it's a string, go do another thing." There's another additional challenge, which is, even if you did support overloading, you're saying, "Okay, well, here's a version of a function for integers and a function for strings." Well, you'd have to, even if you could put it in that dictionary, you'd have to have the caller do the dispatch. And so, every time you call the function, you'd have to say, "Is it an integer or is it a string?" And so you'd have to figure out where to do that test. And so, in a dynamic language, overloading is something you don't have to have. So, but now you get into a typed language, and in Python, if you subscript with an integer, then you get typically one element out of a collection. If you subscript with a range, you get a different thing out. And so often, in typed languages, you'll want to be able to express the fact that, "Cool, I have different behavior depending on what I actually pass into this thing." If you can model that, it can make it safer and more predictable and faster and all these things. It somehow feels safer, yes, but it also feels empowering, in terms of clarity. You don't have to design different functions. This is also one of the challenges with the existing Python typing systems, is that in practice, you take subscript, in practice, a lot of these functions, they don't have one signature. They actually have different behavior in different cases, and so this is why it's difficult to retrofit this into existing Python code and make it play well with typing. You kind of have to design for that. Okay, so there's an interesting distinction that people that program Python might be interested in, is def versus fn. So it's two different ways to define a function. And fn is a stricter version of def. What's the coolness that comes from the strictness? So here you get into, what is the trade-off with a superset? Yes. Okay, so a superset. You have to, or you really want to be compatible. Like if you're doing a superset, you've decided compatibility with existing code is the important thing, even if some of the decisions they made were maybe not what you'd choose. Okay. So that means you put a lot of time into compatibility, and it means that you get locked into decisions of the past, even if they may not have been a good thing. Now, systems programmers typically like to control things. Right? And they want to make sure that you know, not in all cases of course, and even systems programmers are not one thing, right? But often you want predictability. And so one of the things that Python has, for example, as you know, is that if you define a variable, you just say x equals 4. I have a variable named x. Now I say some long name equals 17. Print out some long name, oops, but I typoed it. Right? Well, the compiler, the Python compiler doesn't know, in all cases, what you're defining and what you're using, and did you typo the use of it or the definition? Right? And so for people coming from typed languages, again, I'm not saying they're right or wrong, but that drives them crazy because they want the compiler to tell them, you typoed the name of this thing. Right? And so what Fn does is it turns on, as you say, it's a strict mode. And so it says, okay, well, you have to actually declare, intentionally declare your variables before you use them. That gives you more predictability, more error checking and things like this, but you don't have to, you don't have to use it. And this is a way that Mojo is both compatible, because defs work the same way that defs have already always worked, but it provides a new alternative that gives you more control and allows certain kinds of people that have a different philosophy to be able to express that and get that. But usually, if you're writing Mojo code from scratch, you'll be using Fn. It depends, again, it depends on your mentality right? It's not that def is Python and Fn is Mojo. Mojo has both and it loves both. It really depends on Yeah, exactly. Are you playing around and scripting something out and is it a one-off throwaway script? Cool, like, Python is great at that. I'll still be using Fn, but yeah. I love strictness. Okay, well, so. Control. Power. You also like suffering, right? Yes. Go hand in hand. How many pull-ups? I've lost count at this point. Yeah, exactly. And that's cool. I love you for that. And I love other people who like strict things, right? But I don't want to say that that's the right thing because Python's also very beautiful for hacking around and doing stuff and research and these other cases where you may not want that. See, I just feel like maybe I'm wrong on that, but it feels like strictness leads to faster debugging. So in terms of going from even on a small project from zero to completion, it just, I guess it depends how many bugs you generate usually. Well, so, I mean, it's, again, lessons learned in looking at the ecosystem. It's really, I mean, I think it's, if you study some of these languages over time, like the Ruby community, for example. Now, Ruby is a pretty well developed, pretty established community, but along their path, they really invested in unit testing. So I think that the Ruby community has really pushed forward the state of the art of testing because they didn't have a type system that caught a lot of bugs at compile time, right? And so you can have the best of both worlds. You can have good testing and good types, right? And things like this. But I thought that it was really interesting to see how certain challenges get solved. And in Python, for example, the interactive notebook kind of experiences and stuff like this are really amazing. And if you typo something, it doesn't matter. It just tells you. It's fine. Right? And so I think that the trade-offs are very different if you're building a large-scale production system versus you're building and exploring a notebook. Speaking of control, the hilarious thing, if you look at code I write just for myself for fun, it's like littered with asserts everywhere. It's a kind of... Yeah, you'd like types. It's basically saying in a dictatorial way, "This should be true now, otherwise everything stops." Well, and that is the sign. I love you, man. But that is a sign of somebody who likes control. And so yes, I think that you'll like FN. I think you'll like Mojo. Therapy session. Yes, I definitely will. Speaking of asserts, exceptions are called errors. Why is it called errors? So we use the same...we're the same as Python. But we implement it in a very different way. And so if you look at other languages, like we'll pick on C++, our favorite, C++ has a thing called zero-cost exception handling. And this is in my opinion something to learn lessons from. It's a nice, polite way of saying it. And so zero-cost exception handling, the way it works is that it's called zero-cost because if you don't throw an exception, there's supposed to be no overhead for the non-error code. And so it takes the error path out of the common path. It does this by making throwing an error extremely expensive. And so if you actually throw an error with a C++ compiler using exceptions, it has to go look up in tables on the side and do all this stuff. And so throwing an error could be like 10,000 times more expensive than returning from a function. Also, it's called zero-cost exceptions, but it's not zero-cost by any stretch of the imagination because it massively bloats out your code, your binary. It also adds a whole bunch of different paths because of destructors and other things like that that exist in C++. And it reduces the number of optimizations, it has all these effects. And so this thing that was called zero-cost exceptions, it really ain't. Okay? Now, if you fast forward to newer languages, and this includes Swift and Rust and Go and now Mojo, well, and Python's a little bit different because it's interpreted, and so it's got a little bit of a different thing going on. But if you look at compiled languages, many newer languages say, "Okay, well, let's not do that zero-cost exception handling thing. Let's actually throw an error the same as returning a variant, returning either the normal result or an error." Now, programmers generally don't want to deal with all the typing machinery and pushing around a variant. And so you use all the syntax that Python gives us, for example, try and catch, functions that raise and things like this. You can put a raises decorator on your functions, stuff like this, if you want to control that. And then the language can provide syntax for it, but under the hood, the way the computer executes it, throwing an error is basically as fast as returning something. So it's exactly the same way from a compiled perspective. And so this is actually, I mean, it's a fairly nerdy thing, right? Which is why I love it. But this has a huge impact on the way you design your APIs. So in C++, huge communities turn off exceptions because the cost is just so high. And so the zero-cost cost is so high, right? And so that means you can't actually use exceptions in many libraries. Interesting. And even for the people that do use it, well, okay, how and when do you want to pay the cost? If I try to open a file, should I throw an error? Well, what if I'm probing around looking for something, right? I'm looking it up and made different paths. Well, if it's really slow to do that, maybe I'll add another function that doesn't throw an error, or turns an error code instead, and now I have two different versions of the same thing, and so it causes you to fork your APIs. And so, you know, one of the things I learned from Apple and Nysa Love is the art of API design is actually really profound. I think this is something that Python's also done a pretty good job at in terms of building out this large-scale package ecosystem. It's about having standards and things like this. And so, you know, we wouldn't want to enter a mode where, you know, there's this theoretical feature that exists in language but people don't use it in practice. Now, I'll also say, one of the other really cool things about this implementation approach is that it can run on GPUs, and it can run on accelerators and things like this. And that standard zero-cost exception thing would never work on an accelerator. And so this is also part of how Mojo can scale all the way down to little embedded systems and to running on GPUs and things like that. Can you actually say about maybe is there some high-level way to describe the challenge of exceptions and how they work in code during compilation? So just this idea of percolating up a thing, an error. Yeah. So the way to think about it is think about a function that doesn't return anything. Just as a simple case, right? And so you have function one calls function two, calls function three, calls function four, along that call stack there are try blocks, right? And so if you have function one calls function two, function two has a try block, and then within it it calls function three, right? Well, what happens if function three throws? Well, actually, start simpler. What happens if it returns? Well, if it returns, it's supposed to go back out and continue executing and then fall off the bottom of the try block and keep going and all's good. If the function throws, you're supposed to exit the current function and then get into the accept clause, right? And then do whatever code's there and then keep following on and going on. And so the way that a compiler like Mojo works is that the call to that function, which happens in the accept block, calls a function, and then instead of returning nothing, it actually returns a variant between nothing and an error. And so if you return normally, fall off the bottom or do a return, you return nothing. And if you throw an error, you return the variant that is "I'm an error," right? So when you get to the call, you say, "Okay, cool, I called a function. Hey, I know locally I'm in a try block." And so I call the function and then I check to see what it returns. Aha, if it's that error thing, jump to the accept block. And that's all done for you behind the scenes. Exactly. And so the compiler does all this for you. I mean, one of the things, if you dig into how this stuff works in Python, it gets a little bit more complicated because you have finally blocks, which now you need to go into, do some stuff, and then those can also throw and return. Wait, what? Nested? Yeah, and the stuff matters for compatibility. Really? You can nest them? There's with clauses, and so with clauses are kind of like finally blocks with some special stuff going on, and so there's... Nesting in general, nesting of anything, nesting of functions, should be illegal. Well, it just feels like it adds a level of complexity. Lex, I'm merely an implementer, and so this is again, one of the trade-offs you get when you decide to build a superset is you get to implement a full fidelity implementation of the thing that you decided is good, and so yeah, I mean, we can complain about the reality of the world and shake our fist, but... It always feels like you shouldn't be allowed to do that, like to declare functions and set functions. Oh, wait, wait, wait. What happened to Lex, the Lisp guy? No, I understand that, but Lisp is what I used to do in college. So now you've grown up? You know, we've all done things in college we're not proud of. I love Lisp, I love Lisp. Yeah, I was gonna say, you're afraid of me irritating the whole internet? It worked as a joke in my head and it came out right. So nested functions are, joking aside, actually really great, for certain things, right? And so these are also called closures. Closures are pretty cool, and you can pass callbacks, there's a lot of good patterns. So speaking of which, I don't think you have nested functions implemented yet in Mojo. We don't have lambda syntax, but we do have nested functions. There's a few things on the roadmap that you have that would be cool to sort of just fly through, because it's interesting to see how many features there are in a language. And then you have to implement them. So first of all, there's tuple support. That has to do with some very specific aspects of it, like the parentheses or not parentheses, that. Yeah, this is just totally a syntactic thing. A syntactic thing. But it's cool still. So keyword arguments and functions? Yeah, so this is where in Python you can say, call a function x=4, and x is the name of the argument. That's a nice sort of self-documenting feature. Yeah, and again, this isn't rock-solid. It's not rocket science to implement. It's just on the list. The bigger features are things like traits. So traits are when you want to define abstract-- So when you get into typed languages, you need the ability to write generics. And so you want to say, I want to write this function, and now I want to work on all things that are arithmetic-like. Well, what does arithmetic-like mean? Well, arithmetic-like is a categorization of a bunch of types. And so, again, you can define it in many different ways, and I'm not going to go into ring theory or something. But you can say it's arithmetic-like if you can add, subtract, multiply, divide it. For example. And so what you're saying is you're saying there's a set of traits that apply to a broad variety of types. And so there are all these types of arithmetic-like, all these tensors, and floating point, integer, and like there's this category of types. And then I can define on an orthogonal axis algorithms that then work against types that have those properties. And so this is a, again, it's a widely known thing. It's been implemented in Swift and Rust and many languages. So it's not Haskell. Which is where everybody learns their tricks from. But we need to implement that, and that will enable a new level of expressivity. So classes. Yeah, classes are a big deal. It's a big deal still to be implemented. Like you said, lambda syntax. And then there's like detail stuff like whole module import. Support for top level code and file scope. And then global variables also. So being able to have variables outside of a top level. And so this comes back to where Mojo came from. And the fact that this is your point one. Right, and so we're building, so Modular's building an AI stack. Right, and an AI stack has a bunch of problems working with hardware and writing high performance kernels and doing this kernel fusion thing I was talking about. And getting the most out of the hardware. And so we've really prioritized and built Mojo to solve Modular's problem. Right, now our North Star is build out and support all the things. And so we're making incredible progress. By the way, Mojo's only like seven months old. So that's another interesting thing. I mean, part of the reason I wanted to mention some of these things is like there's a lot to do and it's pretty cool how you just kind of sometimes you take for granted how much there is in a programming language. How many cool features you kind of rely on. And this is kind of a nice reminder when you lay it as a to-do list. Yeah, and so I mean, but also you look into it's amazing how much is also there. And you take it for granted that a value if you define it, it will get destroyed automatically. Like that little feature itself is actually really complicated given the way the ownership system has to work. And the way that works within Mojo is a huge step forward from what Rust and Swift have done. Can you say that again? When a value when you define it gets destroyed automatically. Yeah, so like say you have a string. So you just find a string on the stack. Or whatever that means. Like in your local function. Right? And so you say like whether it be in a def and so you just say x equals hello world. Right? Well, if your string type requires you to allocate memory, then when it's destroyed you have to deallocate it. So in Python and in Mojo you define that with the del method. Right? Where does that get run? Well, it gets run sometime between the last use of the value and the end of the program. Like in this, you now get into garbage collection. You get into like all these long debated, you talk about religions and trade-offs and things like this. This is a hugely hotly contested world. If you look at C++ the way this works is that if you define a variable or a set of variables within a function, they get destroyed in a last in first out order. So it's like nesting. This has a huge problem because if you define, you have a big scope and you define a whole bunch of values at the top and then you use them and then you do a whole bunch of code that doesn't use them, they don't get destroyed until the very end of that scope. And so this also destroys tail calls. Good functional programming. This has a bunch of different impacts on you talk about reference counting optimizations and things like this. A bunch of very low level things. And so what Mojo does is it has a different approach on it. It's a different approach on that from any language I'm familiar with where it destroys them as soon as possible. And by doing that you get better memory use, you get better predictability, you get tail calls that work, you get a bunch of other things, you get better ownership tracking. There's a bunch of these very simple things that are very fundamental that are already built in there in Mojo today that are the things that nobody talks about generally, but when they don't work right you find out and you have to complain about. Is it trivial to know what's the soonest possible to delete a thing that's not going to be used again? It's generally trivial. It's after the last use of it. So if you define x as a string and then you have some use of x somewhere in your code. Within that scope? Within a scope that's accessible? Yeah, exactly. So you can only use something within its scope. So then it doesn't wait until the end of the scope to delete it. It destroys it after the last use. So there's kind of some very eager machine that's just sitting there and deleting. Yeah, and it's all in the compiler so it's not at runtime. It's also cool. Interesting. And this is actually non-trivial because you have control flow. So it gets complicated pretty quickly and so getting this right was not... So you have to insert delete in a lot of places. Potentially, yeah. Exactly. So the compiler has to reason about this and this is where again, it's experience building languages and not getting this right. So again, you get another chance to do it and you get basic things like this right. But it's extremely powerful when you do that. So there's a bunch of things like that that kind of combine together. And this comes back to the... You get a chance to do it the right way, do it the right way and make sure that every brick you put down is really good so that when you put more bricks on top of it they stack up to something that's beautiful. Well there's also... How many design discussions do there have to be about particular details like implementation of particular small features? Because the features that seem small, I bet some of them might be really require really big design decisions. Yeah. Well so, I mean let me give you another example of this. Python has a feature called async await. So it's a new feature, I mean in the long arc of Python history it's a relatively new feature right, that allows way more expressive asynchronous programming. Okay. Again this is a... Python's a beautiful thing and they did things that are great for Mojo for completely different reasons. The reason the async await got added to Python, as far as I know, is because Python doesn't support threads. Okay. And so Python doesn't support threads but you want to work with networking and other things like that that can block. I mean Python does support threads, it's just not its strength. And so they added this feature called async await. It's also seen in other languages like Swift and JavaScript and many other places as well. Async await in Mojo is amazing! Because we have a high performance heterogeneous compute runtime underneath the covers that then allows non-blocking I/O so you get full use of your accelerator. That's huge! Turns out. It's actually really an important part of fully utilizing the machine. You talk about design discussions, that took a lot of discussions, right? And it probably will require more iteration. And so my philosophy with Mojo is that we have a small team of really good people that are pushing forward and they're very good at the extremely deep knowing how the compiler and runtime and all the low level stuff works together. But they're not perfect. Same thing as the Swift team. And this is where one of the reasons we released Mojo much earlier is so we can get feedback. And we've already renamed a keyword due to community feedback. We used an ampersand and now it's named in/out. We're not renaming existing Python keywords because that breaks compatibility. We're renaming things we're adding. And making sure that they are designed well, we get usage experience, we iterate and work with the community because again, if you scale something really fast in your code and everybody writes all their code and they start using it in production then it's impossible to change. And so you want to learn from people, you want to iterate and work on that early on. And this is where design discussions, it's actually quite important. Could you incorporate an emoji into the language? Into the main language? I could. Do you have a favorite one? Well I really like in terms of humor, I like "rawful" whatever, "rawing on the floor laughing." So that could be like a what would that be the use case for that? Throw an exception of some sort? You should totally file a feature request. Or maybe a hard one, it has to be a hard one. People have told me that I'm insane, so this is I'm liking this. I'm going to use the viral nature of the internet to actually get this passed. It's funny, you come back to the flame emoji file extension, right? We have the option to use the flame emoji, which even that concept for example, the people at GitHub say, "Now I've seen everything." Yeah, there's something it's kind of reinvigorating. It's like, "Oh, that's possible. That's really cool." For some reason that makes everything else seem really exciting. I think the world is ready for this stuff. When we have a package manager, we'll clearly have to innovate by having the compiled package thing be the little box with the bow on it, right? It has to be done. It has to be done. Is there some stuff on there? Is there something on the roadmap that you're particularly stressed about or excited about that you're thinking about a lot? As a today snapshot, which will be obsolete tomorrow, the lifetime stuff is really exciting. Lifetimes give you safe references to memory without dangling pointers. This has been done in languages like Rust before, so we have a new approach which is really cool. I'm very excited about that. That'll be out to the community very soon. The traits feature is really a big deal. That's blocking a lot of API data design, and so there's that. I think that's really exciting. A lot of it is these table stakes features. One of the things that is, again, also lessons learned with Swift, is that programmers in general like to add syntactic sugar. It's like, "Oh, well this annoying thing, like in Python, you have to spell it underbar underbar add. Why can't I just use plus? Def plus, come on. Why can't I just do that?" So, trivial bit of syntactic sugar. It makes sense. It's beautiful. It's obvious. We're trying not to do that. And so, for two different reasons, one of which is that, again, lesson learned with Swift. Swift has a lot of syntactic sugar, which may be a good thing, maybe not. I don't know. But because it's such an easy and addictive thing to do, sugar makes your blood get crazy, the community will really dig into that and want to do a lot of that. And I think it's very distracting from building core abstractions. The second is, we want to be a good member of the Python community. And so, we want to work with the broader Python community, and yeah, we're pushing forward a bunch of systems programming features, and we need to build them out to understand them. But once we get a long ways forward, I want to make sure that we go back to the Python community and say, "Okay, let's do some design reviews. Let's actually talk about this stuff. Let's figure out how we want this stuff all to work together." And syntactic sugar just makes all that more complicated. And yeah, list comprehension is yet to be implemented. And my favorite, I mean, dictionaries. Yeah, there's some basic stuff. 0.1. 0.1. Yeah, but nonetheless, it's actually still quite interesting and useful. As you mentioned, Modular is very new. Mojo is very new. It's a relatively small team that's building up this gigantic stack, this incredible stack that's going to perhaps define the future of development of our AI overlords. We just hope it will be useful. As do all of us. So what have you learned from this process of building up a team? Maybe one question is, how do you hire great programmers, great people that operate in this compiler, hardware, machine learning, software, interface design space, and maybe are a little bit fluid in what they can do? Language design, too. So building a company is just as interesting in different ways as building a language. Like different skill sets, different things, but super interesting. And I've built a lot of teams in a lot of different places. If you zoom in from the big problem into recruiting, well, so here's our problem. Okay, I'll just be very straightforward about this. We started Modular with a lot of conviction about, we understand the problems, we understand the customer pain points, we need to work backwards from the suffering in the industry, and if we solve those problems we think it will be useful for people. But the problem is, is that the people we need to hire, as you say, are all these super specialized people that have jobs at big tech worlds. And I don't think we have product market fit in the way that a normal startup does, or we don't have product market fit challenges, because right now everybody's using AI and so many of them are suffering and they want help. And so, again, we started with strong conviction. Now, again, you have to hire and recruit the best, and the best all have jobs. And so what we've done is we've said, okay, well let's build an amazing culture. Start with that. That's usually not something a company starts with. Usually you hire a bunch of people and then people start fighting and it turns into a gigantic mess. And then you try to figure out how to improve your culture later. My co-founder Tim in particular is super passionate about making sure that that's right, and we've spent a lot of time early on to make sure that we can scale. Can you comment, sorry, before we get to the second, what makes for a good culture? So, I mean, there's many different cultures, and I have learned many things from many different people. Yeah, you worked with several very unique, almost famously unique cultures. And some of them I learned what to do, and some of them I learned what not to do. And so, we want an inclusive culture. I believe in, like, amazing people working together. And so I've seen cultures where people you have amazing people and they're fighting each other. I see amazing people and they're told what to do. Like, "Thou shalt line up and do what I say. It doesn't matter if it's the right thing. Do it." Right? And neither of these is the and I've seen people that have no direction they're just kind of floating in different places. And they want to be amazing, they just don't know how. And so a lot of it starts with have a clear vision. Right? And so we have a clear vision of what we're doing. And so I kind of grew up at Apple in my engineering life, right? And so a lot of the Apple DNA rubbed off on me. My co-founder Tim also is like a strong product guy. And so what we learned is, you know, I was taught at Apple that you don't work from building cool technology. You don't work from, like, come up with a cool product and think about the features you'll have in the big check boxes and stuff like this. Because if you go talk to customers, they don't actually care about your product. They don't care about your technology. What they care about is their problems. Right? And if your product can help solve their problems, well hey, they might be interested in that. Right? And so if you speak to them about their problems, if you understand and you have compassion, you understand what people are working with, then you can work backwards to building an amazing product. So the vision starts by defining the problem. And then you can work backwards in solving technology. Got it. And at Apple, like it's, I think, pretty famously said that, you know, for every you know, there's a hundred no's for every yes. I would refine that to say that there's a hundred not yets for every yes. But famously, if you go back to the iPhone, for example, right? The iPhone 1, I mean, many people laughed at it because it didn't have 3G, it didn't have copy and paste. Right? And then a year later, okay, finally it has 3G, but it still doesn't have copy and paste, it's a joke. Nobody will ever use this product, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Right? Well, year three it had copy and paste, and people stopped talking about it. Right? And so being laser focused and having conviction, understanding what the core problems are, and giving the team the space to be able to build the right tech is really important. Also, I mean, you come back to recruiting, you have to pay well. Right? So we have to pay industry leading salaries and have good benefits and things like this, that's a big piece. We're a remote first company, and so we have to so remote first has a very strong set of pros and cons. On the one hand, you can hire people from wherever they are, and you can attract amazing talent even if they live in strange places or unusual places. On the other hand, you have times where you have to go to different zones. On the other hand, you have like everybody on the internet will fight if they don't understand each other, and so we've had to learn how to have a system where we actually fly people in, and we get the whole company together periodically, and then we get work groups together, and we plan and execute together. There's like an intimacy to the in-person brainstorming that I guess you lose, but maybe you don't. Maybe if you get to know each other well and you trust each other, maybe you can do that. Well, so when the pandemic first hit, I mean, I'm curious about your experience too. One thing I missed was having whiteboards. Yeah. Right? Those design discussions where you're like, "I can high intensity work through things, get things done, work through the problem of the day, understand where you're on, figure out and solve the problem, and move forward." Yeah. But we've figured out ways to work around that now with all these screen sharing and other things like that that we do. The thing I miss now is sitting down at a lunch table with the team. Yeah. The spontaneous things, like the coffee bar things, and the bumping into each other and getting to know people outside of the transactional "solve a problem over Zoom" thing. And I think there's just a lot of stuff that I'm not an expert at this, I don't know who is. Hopefully there's some people. But there's stuff that somehow is missing on Zoom. Even with the whiteboard, if you look at that, if you have a room with one person at the whiteboard and there's like three other people at a table, there's a first of all, there's a social aspect to that where you're just shooting the shit a little bit. Almost like... Yeah, as people are just kind of coming in and... Yeah, that. But also while it's a breakout discussion that happens for like seconds at a time, maybe an inside joke, or it's like this interesting dynamic that happens that Zoom... And you're bonding. You're bonding, but through that bonding you get the excitement. There's certain ideas that are like complete bullshit and you'll see that in the faces of others. That you won't see necessarily on Zoom. Something... It feels like that should be possible to do without being in person. Well, I mean, being in person is a very different thing. It's worth it. But you can't always do it. And so, again, we're still learning and we're all still learning humanity with this new reality, right? But what we found is that getting people together, whether it be a team or the whole company or whatever, is worth the expense because people work together and are happier after that. Like it just... There's a massive period of time where you go out and things start getting frayed, pull people together, and then you realize that we're all working together. We see things the same way. We work through the disagreement or the misunderstanding. We're talking across each other and then you work much better together. And so things like that I think are really quite important. What about people that are kind of specialized in very different aspects of the stack working together? What are some interesting challenges there? Yeah, well, so I mean, there's lots of interesting people as you can tell I'm, you know, hard to deal with too. You're one of the most lovable people. You're one of the most lovable people. So, one of the... So there's different philosophies in building teams. For me, and so some people say, "Hire 10x programmers," and that's the only thing whatever that means, right? What I believe in is building well-balanced teams. Teams that have people that are different in them. Like if you have all generals and no troops, or all troops and no generals, or you have all people that think in one way and not the other way, what you get is you get a very biased and skewed and weird situation where people end up being unhappy. And so what I like to do is I like to build teams of people where they're not all the same. You know, we do have teams that are focused on like runtime or compiler, GPU, or whatever the speciality is, but people bring a different take and have a different perspective. And I look for people that complement each other. And particularly if you look at leadership teams and things like this, you don't want everybody thinking the same way. You want people bringing different perspectives and experiences. And so I think that's really important. That's team, but what about building a company as ambitious as Modular? So what, uh, some interesting questions there? Oh, I mean, so many. Like, so, um, one of the things I love about, okay, so, Modular's the first company I built from scratch. Um, uh, one of the first things that was profound was I'm not cleaning up somebody else's mess. Right? And so if you look at... And that's liberating to some degree. It's super liberating. And, um, and also, many of the projects I've built in the past have not been core to the product of the company. Swift is not Apple's product. Right? Uh, MLIR is not Google's revenue machine or whatever, right? It's not... It's important, but it's like working on the accounting software for, you know, the retail giant or something, right? It's like enabling infrastructure and technology. And so at Modular, the tech we're building is here to solve people's problems. Like, it is directly the thing that we're giving to people. And so this is a really big difference. And what it means for me as a leader, but also for many of our engineers, is they're working on the thing that matters. And that's actually pretty... I mean, again, for, for a compiler people and things like that, that's, that's usually not the case, right? And so that's, that's also pretty exciting and, and quite nice. But the, um, one of the ways that this manifests is it makes it easier to make decisions. And so one of the challenges I've had in other worlds is it's like, okay, well, community matters somehow for the goodness of the world, like, or open source matters, theoretically, but I don't want to pay for a t-shirt. Right? Or some swag. Like, well, t-shirts cost 10 bucks each, you can have 100 t-shirts for $1,000. To a mega corp, $1,000 is uncountably... can't count that low. Right? But justifying it and getting a t-shirt... By the way, if you'd like a t-shirt, give me a t-shirt. I would 100% like a t-shirt. Are you joking? You can have a fire emoji t-shirt. I will, I will treasure this. Is that a good thing? I will pass it down to my grandchildren. And so, you know, it's, it's very liberating to be able to decide, I think that Lex should have a t-shirt. Right? And it becomes very simple because I like Lex. This, this, uh, this is awesome. Um, so... I have to ask you about the... One of the interesting developments with large language models is that they're able to generate code, uh, recently really well. Yes. To a degree that, uh, maybe, uh, I don't know if you understand, but I have, I struggle to understand because it forces me to ask questions about the nature of programming, of the nature of thought, because the, uh, language models are able to predict the kind of code I was about to write so well. Yep. That it makes me wonder, like, how unique my brain is, and where the valuable ideas actually come from. Like, how much do I contribute in terms of, uh, ingenuity, innovation to code I write, or design, and that kind of stuff. Um, when you stand on the shoulders of giants, are you really doing anything? And what LLMs are helping you do is they help you stand on the shoulders of giants in your program. There's mistakes, they're interesting that you learn from, but I just, it would love to get your opinion first, high level of what you think about, uh, this impact of large language models when they do program synthesis, when they generate code. Yeah, well, so, um, I don't know where it all goes. Yeah. Um, I'm an optimist, and I'm a human optimist, right? I think that, um, things I've seen are that a lot of the LLMs are really good at crushing leet code projects, and they can reverse the linked list like crazy, um, well, it turns out there's a lot of instances of that on the internet, and it's a pretty stock thing, and so if you want to see standard questions answered, LLMs can memorize all the answers, and that can be amazing. And also they do generalize out from that, and so there's good work on that, but, um, but I think that if you, in my experience, building things, building something, like you talk about Mojo, or you talk about these things, or you talk about building an applied solution to a problem, it's also about working with people. It's about understanding the problem. What is the product that you want to build? What are the use cases? What are the customers? You can't just go survey all the customers because they'll tell you that they want a faster horse. Maybe they need a car. Right? And so a lot of it comes into, um, you know, I don't feel like we have to compete with LLMs. I think they'll help automate a ton of the mechanical stuff out of the way, and just like, you know, I think we all try to scale through delegation and things like this, delegating root things to an LLM I think is an extremely valuable approach that will help us all scale and be more productive. But I think it's a fascinating companion. But I'd say I don't think that means that we're going to be done with coding. But there's power in it as a companion. And from there, I could, I would love to zoom in on Mojo a little bit. Do you think, uh, do you think about that? Do you think about LLMs generating Mojo code? Uh, and helping sort of, like, when you design a new programming language, it almost seems like man, it would be nice to this thing. Sort of, um, almost as a way to learn how I'm supposed to use this thing for them to be trained on some of the Mojo code. Yeah. So I do lead an AI company, so maybe there will be a Mojo LLM at some point. Uh, but if your question is like, how do we make a language to be suitable for LLMs? Yeah. I think that the, um, I think the cool thing about LLMs is you don't have to. Right? And so if you look at, what is English, or any of these other terrible languages that we as humans deal with on a continuous basis, they're never designed for machines. And yet, they're the intermediate representation. They're the exchange format that we humans use to get stuff done. Right? And so these programming languages, they're an intermediate representation between the human and the computer. Or, the human and the compiler. Roughly. Right? And so, I think the LLMs will have no problem learning whatever keyword we pick. Maybe the phi emoji is gonna be critical. Oh, maybe that's gonna break it? It doesn't tokenize? No, the, uh, reverse of that, it will actually enable it. Because one of the issues I could see with being a superset of Python, is there would be confusion about the gray area. So it would be mixing stuff. Uh, but... Well, I'm a human optimist, and I'm also an LLM optimist. I think that we'll solve that problem. We'll solve it, yeah. But the, uh, um, but you look at that and you say, okay, well, reducing the rote thing, right? Turns out compilers are very particular, and they really want things, they really want the indentation to be right. They really want the colon to be there. On your else or else it'll complain. Right? I mean, compilers can do better at this, but, um, LLMs can totally help solve that problem. So I'm very happy about the new, uh, predictive coding and copilot type features and things like this, because I think it'll all just make us more productive. It's still messy and fuzzy and uncertain, unpredictable, so... But is there a future you see, given how big of a leap GPT-4 was? Where you start to see something like LLMs inside a compiler? Or no? Uh, I mean, you could do that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that would be interesting. Is that wise? Well, I mean, it would be very expensive. So, compilers run fast and they're very efficient, and LLMs are currently very expensive. There's on-device LLMs and there's other things going on, and so maybe there's an answer there. Um, I think that one of the things that I haven't seen enough of is that so LLMs to me are amazing when you tap into the creative potential of the hallucinations, right? And so if you're doing creative brainstorming or creative writing or things like that, the hallucinations work in your favor. Um, if you're writing code that has to be correct because you're gonna ship it in production, then maybe that's not actually a feature. And so I think that there has been research and there has been work on building algebraic reasoning systems and kind of like figuring out more things that feel like proofs. And so I think that there could be interesting work in terms of building more reliable at scale systems, and that could be interesting. But if you chase that rabbit hole down, the question then becomes how do you express your intent to the machine? And so maybe you want an LLM to provide the spec, but you have a different kind of net that then actually implements the code. Right, so it's to use the documentation and inspiration versus the actual implementation. Yeah, potentially. Since a successful modular will be the thing that runs I say so jokingly, our AI overlords, but AI systems that are used across I know it's a cliche term, but Internet of Things, so across So I'll joke and say like AGI should be written in Mojo. Yeah. AGI should be written in Mojo. You're joking, but it's also possible that it's not a joke. That a lot of the ideas behind Mojo seems like the natural set of ideas that would enable at scale training and inference of AI systems. So I just have to ask you about the big philosophical question about human civilization. So folks like Eliezer Yudkowsky are really concerned about the threat of AI. Do you think about the good and the bad that can happen at scale deployment of AI systems? Well, so I've thought a lot about it, and there's a lot of different parts to this problem, everything from job displacement to Skynet, things like this. And so you can zoom into subparts of this problem. I'm not super optimistic about AGI being solved next year. I don't think that's going to happen personally. So you have a kind of Zen-like calm about... There's a nervousness because the leap of GPT-4 seemed so big. Sure. It's huge. It's like we're almost... There's some kind of transitionary period. You're thinking... Well, so I mean there's a couple of things going on there. One is I'm sure GPT-5 and 7 and 19 will be also huge leaps. They're also getting much more expensive to run. And so there may be a limiting function in terms of just expense on the one hand, and train. That could be a limiter that slows things down. But I think the bigger limiter is outside of Skynet takes over and... I don't spend any time thinking about that because if Skynet takes over and kills us all, then I'll be dead. So I don't worry about that. I mean, that's just... Other things to worry about, I'll just focus on. I'll focus and not worry about that one. But I think that the other thing I'd say is that AI moves quickly, but humans move slowly. And we adapt slowly. And so what I expect to happen is just like any technology diffusion, like the promise and then the application takes time to roll out. And so I think that I'm not even too worried about autonomous cars defining away all the taxi drivers. Remember, autonomy was supposed to be solved by 2020? Yeah, boy do I remember. So, and so I think that on the one hand we can see amazing progress, but on the other hand we can see that reality is a little bit more complicated and it may take longer to roll out than you might expect. Well that's in the physical space. I do think in the digital space is the stuff that's built on top of LLMs that runs the millions of apps that can be built on top of them and that could be run on millions of devices, millions of types of devices. I just think that the rapid effect it has on human civilization could be truly transformative to it. Well, and so and there I think it depends on are you an optimist or a pessimist or a masochist. Just to clarify, optimist about human civilization. Me too. And so I look at that as saying okay cool, well yeah I do. And so some people say oh my god it's going to destroy us all, how do we prevent that? I kind of look at it from a is it going to unlock us all? Right, you talk about coding, is it going to make so I don't have to do all the repetitive stuff? Well suddenly that's a very optimistic way to look at it and you look at what a lot of these technologies have done to improve our lives and I want that to go faster. What do you think the future of programming looks like in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years? With LLMs and with Mojo, with modular, like your vision for devices, the hardware, to the compilers, to the different stacks of software. Well so what I want, I mean coming back to my arch nemesis, it's complexity. So again, me being the optimist, if we drive down complexity, we can make these tools, these technologies, these cool hardware widgets accessible to way more people. And so what I'd love to see is more personalized experiences, more things, the research getting into production instead of being lost at NeurIPS. And so like the these things that impact people's lives by entering products. And so one of the things that I'm a little bit concerned about is right now the big companies are investing huge amounts of money and are driving the top line of AI capability forward really quickly. But if it means that you have to have a hundred million dollars to train a model or more, a hundred billion dollars, right, well that's gonna make it very concentrated with very few people in the world that can actually do this stuff. I'd much rather see lots of people across the industry be able to participate and use this. When you look at this, you know, I mean a lot of great research has been done in the health world, looking at like detecting pathologies and doing radiology with AI and like doing all these things. Well, the problem today is that to deploy and build these systems you have to be an expert in radiology and an expert in AI. And if we can break down the barriers so that more people can use AI techniques, and it's more like programming Python, which roughly everybody can do if they want to, right, then I think that we'll get a lot more practical application of these techniques and a lot more nichier, cool, but narrower demands. And I think that's gonna be really cool. Do you think we'll have more or less programmers in the world than now? Well, so I think we'll have more programmers, but they may not consider themselves to be programmers. That'd be a different name for it. Right, I mean, do you consider somebody that uses you know, I think that arguably the most popular programming language is Excel. Yeah. Right? Yep. And so do they consider themselves to be programmers? Maybe not. I mean, some of them make crazy macros and stuff like that, but what you mentioned, Steve Jobs, is it's the bicycle for the mind that allows you to go faster, right? And so I think that as we look forward, right, what is AI? I look at it as hopefully a new programming paradigm. It's like object-oriented programming. Right, if you want to write a cat detector, you don't use for loops. Turns out that's not the right tool for the job, right? And so right now, unfortunately, because, I mean, it's not unfortunate, but it's just kind of where things are, AI is this weird, different thing that's not integrated into programming languages and normal tool chains and all the technology is really weird and doesn't work right and you have to babysit it and every time you switch to hardware it's different. It shouldn't be that way! When you change that, when you fix that, suddenly again, the tools and technologies can be way easier to use. You can start using them for many more things. And so that's why I would be excited about it. What kind of advice could you give to somebody in high school right now or maybe early college who's curious about programming and feeling like the world is changing really quickly here? Yeah, well... What kind of stuff to learn, what kind of stuff to work on? Should they finish college? Should they go work at a company? Should they build a thing? What do you think? Well, so, I mean, one of the things I'd say is that you'll be most successful if you work on something you're excited by. And so don't get the book and read the book cover to cover and study and memorize and recite and flashcard and go build something. Like, go solve a problem. Go build the thing that you want to exist. Go build an app. Go build... train a model. Like, go build something and actually use it and set a goal for yourself. And if you do that, then you'll... you know, there's a success, there's the adrenaline rush, there's the achievement, there's the unlock that I think is where, you know, if you keep setting goals and you keep doing things and building things, learning by building is really powerful. In terms of career advice, I mean, everybody's different. It's very hard to give generalized advice. I'll speak as, you know, a compiler nerd. If everybody's going left, sometimes it's pretty cool to go right. And so just because everybody's doing a thing, it doesn't mean you have to do the same thing and follow the herd. In fact, I think that sometimes the most exciting paths through life lead to being curious about things that nobody else actually focuses on, right? And it turns out that understanding deeply parts of the problem that people want to take for granted makes you extremely valuable and specialized in ways that the herd is not. And so, again, I mean, there's lots of rooms for specialization, lots of rooms for generalists, there's lots of room for different kinds and parts of the problem, but I think that it's, you know, just because everybody's doing one thing doesn't mean you should necessarily do it. And now the herd is using Python, so if you want to be a rebel, go check out Mojo and help Chris and the rest of the world fight the arch-nemesis of complexity, because simple is beautiful. There you go. Chris, you're an incredible person. You've been so kind to me ever since we met. You've been extremely supportive. I'm forever grateful for that. Thank you for being who you are, for being legit, for being kind, for fighting this really interesting problem of how to make AI accessible to a huge number of people, huge number of devices. Yeah, well, so, Lex, you're a pretty special person, too, right? And so, I think that, you know, one of the funny things about you is that besides being curious and pretty damn smart, you're actually willing to push on things, and you're, I think that you've got an agenda to, like, make the world think, which I think is a pretty good agenda. It's a pretty good one. Thank you so much for talking to me, Chris. Yeah. Thanks, Lex. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Ladner. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Isaac Asimov. "I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them." Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
