[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.740]   - Hello, hello.
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.920]   This is Swix back again with part two
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.960]   of our NeurIPS coverage.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.060]   This time we're gonna cover startups
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.000]   and it's a special episode
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   because this is the last episode of 2023.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.820]   We are definitely looking back at the year
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.800]   with rose colored glasses.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.000]   This has been a fantastic year.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.280]   We only started this podcast in February
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.840]   and it's grown so much.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520]   Thanks to all of you who've listened
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.720]   and give feedback and shared it with your friends.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.320]   And we actually managed to invite a few
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.560]   of our former guests back on the pod
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.480]   together with some new friends
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.520]   and probably some new voices
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.840]   that you're gonna be hearing next year.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.160]   So this is not a hard hitting interview series.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.480]   You know, it's not that kind of interview.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.960]   It's not that kind of podcast where we try to go too deep.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.440]   Today we're just gonna go broad
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.000]   and we're just gonna check in on a bunch of startups
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.680]   that we like and monitor and we're present at NeurIPS.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.560]   So first up is John Frankel of Mosaic ML.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.840]   We last talked to him in May for the MPT7B episode.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.280]   That's episode 13.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.920]   And I have to say that was one of the best performing
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.880]   episodes of the whole year.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.920]   So you're welcome to go back and listen to that
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.040]   if you missed it.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.680]   And since then they were bought by Databricks
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.120]   for $1.3 billion.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.360]   And actually during the interview,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.080]   they were in the process of getting acquired.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.440]   They just couldn't say anything about it,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.520]   but it's definitely one of the biggest news of the year.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.320]   And you can listen to what it's like
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.440]   or what's going through John's mind back then
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.520]   as well as now today, six months later.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280]   - Hey Jonathan, welcome back to the pod.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.120]   - Thank you so much.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.880]   This is an interesting place to have the pod
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.640]   under the overpass of interstate whatever it is.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.520]   - Yeah, interstate whatever in the city of New Orleans.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.840]   Yeah, it's really good to see you.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.560]   Since you were last on the pod, Mosaic got acquired.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.400]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.920]   I think you really deserve all the credit for this.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.560]   - No, you guys were sitting on that news
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.040]   and we didn't know what was gonna happen.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.040]   But I did come away from your interview
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.520]   with a very, very high impression of like,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.960]   you guys are in a perfect place, perfect time
