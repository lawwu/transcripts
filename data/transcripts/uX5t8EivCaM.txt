[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180]   The following is a conversation with Scott Aronson,
[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.920]   a professor at UT Austin,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.200]   director of its Quantum Information Center
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.000]   and previously a professor at MIT.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   His research interests center around the capabilities
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.580]   and limits of quantum computers
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.720]   and computational complexity theory more generally.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.520]   He is an excellent writer
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.120]   and one of my favorite communicators
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.320]   of computer science in the world.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.480]   We only had about an hour and a half for this conversation,
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.160]   so I decided to focus on quantum computing,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.920]   but I can see us talking again in the future
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.240]   on this podcast at some point
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   about computational complexity theory
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.480]   and all the complexity classes that Scott catalogs
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.100]   in his amazing Complexity Zoo Wiki.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.640]   As a quick aside,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.040]   based on questions and comments I've received,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.200]   my goal with these conversations
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.560]   is to try to be in the background without ego
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.400]   and do three things.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.980]   One, let the guests shine and try to discover together
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.080]   the most beautiful insights in their work
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.720]   and in their mind.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.920]   Two, try to play devil's advocate,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.480]   just enough to provide a creative tension
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.000]   in exploring ideas through conversation.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.720]   And three, to ask very basic questions
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.240]   about terminology, about concepts, about ideas.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.720]   Many of the topics we talk about in the podcast
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.560]   I've been studying for years,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.760]   as a grad student, as a researcher,
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.160]   and generally as a curious human who loves to read.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   But frankly, I see myself in these conversations
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.640]   as the main character for one of my favorite novels
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.120]   by Dostoyevsky called "The Idiot."
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.900]   I enjoy playing dumb.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.040]   Clearly it comes naturally.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.240]   But the basic questions don't come from my ignorance
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.660]   of the subject, but from an instinct
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.760]   that the fundamentals are simple.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.980]   And if we linger on them from almost a naive perspective,
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.240]   we can draw an insightful thread from computer science
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.320]   to neuroscience, to physics, to philosophy,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.900]   and to artificial intelligence.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.480]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.680]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.640]   give it five stars on Apple Podcasts,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.960]   support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.520]   at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.440]   As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.880]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.120]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.520]   I hope that works for you
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.100]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.560]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.080]   Two supporters today.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.640]   First, get Cash App and use the code LEXPODCAST.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.040]   Second, listen to the Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.280]   for tech news.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.420]   Search "ride home," two words, in your podcast app.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.440]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.880]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.320]   When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.600]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.100]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.000]   with as little as $1.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.020]   Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.020]   a subsidiary of Square, a member of SIPC.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.340]   Since Cash App does fractional share trading,
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.180]   let me mention that the order execution algorithm
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.760]   that works behind the scenes
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.500]   to create the abstraction of fractional orders
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.620]   is an algorithmic marvel.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.940]   So big props to the Cash App engineers
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.460]   for solving a hard problem that, in the end,
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.260]   provides an easy interface that takes a step up
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.140]   to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.480]   making trading more accessible for new investors
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.700]   and diversification much easier.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.580]   So again, if you get Cash App
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.380]   from the App Store or Google Play
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.220]   and use the code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.080]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.100]   one of my favorite organizations
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.360]   that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.580]   for young people around the world.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.220]   This episode is also supported
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.740]   by the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.620]   It's a technology podcast I've been listening to for a while
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.260]   and really enjoying.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.740]   It goes straight to the point,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.660]   gives you the tech news you need to know,
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.080]   and provides minimal but essential context.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.980]   It's released every day by 5 p.m. Eastern,
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.600]   and is only about 15 to 20 minutes long.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.260]   For fun, I like building apps on smartphones,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.820]   most on Android, so I'm always a little curious
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.120]   about new flagship phones that come out.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.620]   I saw that Samsung announced the new Galaxy S20,
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.700]   and of course, right away,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.520]   Tech Meme Ride Home has a new episode
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.220]   that summarizes all that I needed to know
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.540]   about this new device.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.580]   They've also started to do weekend bonus episodes
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.020]   with interviews of people like AOL founder Steve Case
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.580]   on investing and Gary Marcus on AI,
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.700]   who I've also interviewed on this podcast.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.580]   You can find the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.580]   if you search your podcast app for ride home, two words.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.140]   Then subscribe, enjoy, and keep up to date
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.580]   with the latest tech news.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.660]   And now, here's my conversation with Scott Aronson.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.640]   I sometimes get criticism from a listener here and there
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.400]   that while having a conversation
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.180]   with a world-class mathematician, physicist,
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.180]   neurobiologist, aerospace engineer,
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.740]   or a theoretical computer scientist like yourself,
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.660]   I waste time by asking philosophical questions
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.340]   about free will, consciousness, mortality,
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.900]   love, nature of truth, superintelligence,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.500]   whether time travel is possible,
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.940]   whether space-time is emergent and fundamental,
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.420]   even the crazier questions like whether aliens exist,
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.820]   what their language might look like,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.020]   what their math might look like,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.680]   whether math is invented or discovered,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.940]   and of course, whether we live in a simulation or not.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.880]   So I try-- - Out with it.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.360]   - Out with it.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.460]   I try to dance back and forth from the deep technical
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.060]   to the philosophical, so I've done that quite a bit.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.700]   So you're a world-class computer scientist,
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.140]   and yet you've written about this very point
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.700]   that philosophy is important for experts
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.040]   in any technical discipline,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.160]   though they somehow seem to avoid this.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.460]   So I thought it'd be really interesting
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.100]   to talk to you about this point.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.740]   Why should we computer scientists, mathematicians,
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.780]   physicists care about philosophy, do you think?
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.020]   - Well, I would reframe the question a little bit.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.760]   I mean, philosophy, almost by definition,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.940]   is the subject that's concerned with the biggest questions
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.160]   that you could possibly ask, right?
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.740]   So the ones you mentioned, right?
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.440]   Are we living in a simulation?
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.700]   Are we alone in the universe?
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.320]   How should we even think about such questions?
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.980]   Is the future determined?
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.680]   And what do we even mean by it being determined?
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.740]   Why are we alive at the time we are
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.140]   and not at some other time?
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.620]   When you sort of contemplate the enormity
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.020]   of those questions, I think you could ask,
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.500]   well, then why be concerned with anything else, right?
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.740]   Why not spend your whole life on those questions?
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.140]   And I think in some sense,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.580]   that is the right way to phrase the question.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.260]   And actually, what we learned, I mean, throughout history,
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.940]   but really starting with the scientific revolution,
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.500]   with Galileo and so on, is that there is a good reason
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   to focus on narrower questions, more technical,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.620]   mathematical or empirical questions.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.260]   And that is that you can actually make progress on them,
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.260]   and you can actually often answer them.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.740]   And sometimes they actually tell you something
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.820]   about the philosophical questions
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.220]   that sort of maybe motivated your curiosity as a child.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.060]   They don't necessarily resolve
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.760]   the philosophical questions,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.300]   but sometimes they reframe
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.100]   your whole understanding of them.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.140]   And so for me, philosophy is just the thing
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.920]   that you have in the background from the very beginning
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.480]   that you want to, these are sort of the reasons
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.620]   why you went into intellectual life in the first place,
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.620]   at least the reasons why I did, right?
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.180]   But math and science are tools that we have
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.540]   for actually making progress,
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.480]   and hopefully even changing our understanding
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.260]   of these philosophical questions,
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.420]   sometimes even more than philosophy itself does.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.560]   - Why do you think computer scientists avoid these questions?
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.900]   We'll run away from them a little bit,
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.620]   at least in the technical scientific discourse.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.040]   - Well, I'm not sure if they do so
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.180]   more than any other scientist do.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.180]   I mean, Alan Turing was famously interested,
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.420]   and one of his two most famous papers
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.100]   was in a philosophy journal, Mind.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.740]   It was the one where he proposed the Turing test.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.960]   He took Wittgenstein's course at Cambridge,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.480]   argued with him.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.880]   - I just recently learned that little bit,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.380]   and it's actually fascinating.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.440]   I was trying to look for resources
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.640]   in trying to understand where the sources
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.880]   of disagreement and debates between Wittgenstein
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.720]   and Turing were.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.480]   That's interesting that these two minds
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.200]   have somehow met in the arc of history.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   - Yeah, well, the transcript of the course,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.880]   which was in 1939, right,
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.020]   is one of the more fascinating documents
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.560]   that I've ever read, because Wittgenstein
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.200]   is trying to say, well, all of these formal systems
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   are just complete irrelevancies, right?
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.560]   If a formal system is irrelevant, who cares?
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.880]   Why does that matter in real life, right?
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.000]   And Turing is saying, well, look,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.160]   if you use an inconsistent formal system
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160]   to design a bridge, the bridge may collapse, right?
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.720]   And so Turing, in some sense, is thinking decades ahead,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.640]   I think, of where Wittgenstein is
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.080]   to where the formal systems are actually going to be used
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.720]   in computers, right, to actually do things in the world.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   You know, and it's interesting that Turing
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.160]   actually dropped the course halfway through.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.980]   Why?
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.360]   Because he had to go to Bletchley Park
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.280]   and work on something of more immediate importance.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.960]   - That's fascinating.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.200]   Take a step from philosophy to actual,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.040]   like the biggest possible step to actual engineering
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.440]   with actual real impact.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.200]   - Yeah, and I would say more generally, right,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.120]   a lot of scientists are interested in philosophy,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.720]   but they're also busy, right?
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   And they have a lot on their plate,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.760]   and there are a lot of sort of very concrete questions
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.900]   that are already not answered,
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.960]   but look like they might be answerable, right?
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.920]   And so then you could say, well, then why break your brain
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.960]   over these metaphysically unanswerable questions
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.360]   when there are all of these answerable ones instead?
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.280]   So I think, you know, for me,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   I enjoy talking about philosophy.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.880]   I even go to philosophy conferences sometimes,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.080]   such as the, you know, FQXI conferences.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.960]   I enjoy interacting with philosophers.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.780]   I would not want to be a professional philosopher
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.960]   because I like being in a field where I feel like,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.440]   you know, if I get too confused
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.140]   about the sort of eternal questions,
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.080]   then I can actually make progress on something.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.480]   - Can you maybe link on that for just a little longer?
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.320]   - Yeah.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.600]   - What do you think is the difference?
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.640]   So like the corollary of the criticism
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.040]   that I mentioned previously,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.500]   that why ask the philosophical questions
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.840]   of the mathematician,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.220]   is if you want to ask philosophical questions,
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.040]   then invite a real philosopher on and ask them.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.200]   So what's the difference between the way
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.920]   a computer scientist or mathematician
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.640]   ponders a philosophical question
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.300]   and a philosopher ponders a philosophical question?
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   - Well, I mean, a lot of it just depends
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.020]   on the individual, right?
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.780]   It's hard to make generalizations about entire fields.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.620]   But, you know, I think if we tried to,
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.460]   we tried to stereotype, you know,
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.300]   we would say that, you know,
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   scientists very often will be less careful
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.860]   in their use of words.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.160]   You know, I mean, philosophers are really experts
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.140]   in sort of, you know, like when I talk to them,
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.820]   they will just pounce if I, you know,
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.780]   use the wrong phrase for something.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.540]   - Experts is a very nice word.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.140]   You could say sticklers or--
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.420]   - Sticklers, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.940]   Or, you know, they will sort of interrogate
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.900]   my word choices, let's say,
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.900]   to a much greater extent than scientists would, right?
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.300]   And scientists, you know, will often,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.900]   if you ask them about a philosophical problem,
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.860]   like the hard problem of consciousness
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.540]   or free will or whatever,
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.700]   they will try to relate it back to, you know,
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.460]   recent research, you know,
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.860]   research about neurobiology or, you know,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.860]   but, you know, the best of all is research
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.440]   that they personally are involved with, right?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.980]   And, you know, and, you know,
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.380]   of course they will want to talk about that, you know,
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.220]   and it is what they will think of, you know,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.100]   and of course you could have an argument
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.280]   that maybe, you know, it's all interesting as it goes,
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.660]   but maybe none of it touches the philosophical question.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.260]   But, you know, but maybe, you know, a science,
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.560]   you know, at least it, as I said,
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.980]   it does tell us concrete things,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.420]   and, you know, even if, like,
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.500]   a deep dive into neurobiology will not answer
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.540]   the hard problem of consciousness,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.500]   you know, maybe it can take us about as far as we can get
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.380]   toward, you know, expanding our minds about it,
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.080]   you know, toward thinking about it in a different way.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.040]   Well, I mean, I think neurobiology can do that,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.800]   but, you know, with these profound philosophical questions,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.900]   I mean, also art and literature do that, right?
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.400]   They're all different ways of trying
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.240]   to approach these questions that, you know,
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.200]   we don't, for which we don't even know, really,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.680]   what an answer would look like,
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.160]   but, and yet somehow we can't help
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.760]   but keep returning to the questions.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.240]   - And you have a kind of mathematical,
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.260]   a beautiful mathematical way of discussing this
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.760]   with the idea of Q prime.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.600]   - Oh, right.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.800]   - You write that usually the only way to make progress
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.040]   on the big questions, like the philosophical questions
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.440]   we're talking about now,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.360]   is to pick off smaller sub-questions.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.360]   Ideally, sub-questions that you can attack
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.120]   using math, empirical observation, or both.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.380]   You define the idea of a Q prime,
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.120]   so given an unanswerable philosophical riddle, Q,
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.060]   replace it with a merely, in quotes,
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.920]   scientific or mathematical question, Q prime,
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.840]   which captures part of what people have wanted to know
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.860]   when they first asked Q.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.700]   - Yes.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.920]   - Then, with luck, one solves Q prime.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   So, you describe some examples of such Q prime sub-questions
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.240]   in your long essay titled,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.400]   "Why Philosophers Should Care
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.460]   About Computational Complexity."
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.560]   So, you catalog the various Q primes
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.160]   on which you think theoretical computer science
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.040]   has made progress.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.920]   Can you mention a few favorites,
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   if any pop to mind, or that you remember?
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.980]   - Well, yes, so I would say some of the most famous examples
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.760]   in history of that sort of replacement were,
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.280]   I mean, to go back to Alan Turing, right?
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.480]   What he did in his computing machinery
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.360]   and intelligence paper was exactly,
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.080]   he explicitly started with the question,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.880]   "Can machines think?"
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.600]   And then he said, "Sorry, I think that question
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.340]   "is too meaningless, but here's a different question.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.100]   "Could you program a computer
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.580]   "so that you couldn't tell the difference
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.960]   "between it and a human?"
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.800]   Right?
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.960]   - So, in the very first few sentences,
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.920]   he, in fact, just formulates the Q prime question.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.640]   - He does precisely that.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.180]   Or, we could look at Godel, right?
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.480]   Where you had these philosophers arguing for centuries
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.160]   about the limits of mathematical reasoning, right?
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.680]   The limits of formal systems.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.760]   And then, by the early 20th century,
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.340]   logicians, starting with Frege, Russell,
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.480]   and then most spectacularly, Godel,
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.060]   managed to reframe those questions as,
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.820]   look, we have these formal systems,
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.500]   they have these definite rules.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.480]   Are there questions that we can phrase
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.740]   within the rules of these systems
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.220]   that are not provable within the rules of the systems?
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.180]   And can we prove that fact?
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.020]   Right?
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.060]   And so that would be another example.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.580]   I had this essay called,
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.060]   "The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine."
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.900]   It's one of the crazier things I've written.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.740]   But I tried to do something,
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:48.740]   or to advocate doing something similar there for free will.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.900]   Where, instead of talking about,
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.240]   is free will real?
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.500]   Or we get hung up on the meaning of,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   what exactly do we mean by freedom?
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.740]   And can you have, can you be,
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.220]   or do we mean compatibilist free will?
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.660]   Libertarian free will?
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.380]   What do these things mean?
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.220]   I suggested just asking the question,
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.260]   how well, in principle,
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.340]   consistently with the laws of physics,
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.100]   could a person's behavior be predicted?
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.620]   You know, without, so let's say,
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.820]   destroying the person's brain, you know?
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.140]   Taking it apart in the process of trying to predict them.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.620]   And you know, and that actually,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.380]   asking that question gets you into
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.220]   all sorts of meaty and interesting issues.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.100]   You know, issues of,
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.820]   what is the computational substrate of the brain?
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.820]   You know, or can you understand the brain,
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.340]   you know, just at the sort of level of the neurons?
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.340]   You know, at sort of the abstraction of a neural network?
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.900]   Or do you need to go deeper to the, you know,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.020]   molecular level, and ultimately even to the quantum level?
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.860]   Right, and of course,
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.660]   that would put limits on predictability if you did.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.900]   - So you need to reduce,
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.560]   you need to reduce the mind to a computational device,
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.860]   like formalize it so then you can make predictions about,
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.900]   you know, whether you could predict the behavior of a system.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.820]   - Well, if you were trying to predict a person,
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.380]   yeah, then presumably you would need
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.180]   some model of their brain, right?
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.180]   And now the question becomes one of
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.780]   how accurate can such a model become?
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.740]   Can you make a model that will be accurate enough
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.060]   to really seriously threaten people's sense of free will?
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.620]   You know, not just metaphysically,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.140]   but like really, I have written in this envelope
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.780]   what you were going to say next.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.940]   - Is accuracy the right term here?
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.620]   So it's also a level of abstraction has to be right.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.620]   So if you're accurate at the, somehow at the quantum level,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:43.020]   that may not be convincing to us at the human level.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.140]   - Well, right, but the question is what accuracy
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.020]   at the sort of level of the underlying mechanisms
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.220]   do you need in order to predict the behavior, right?
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.300]   At the end of the day, the test is just,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.820]   can you, you know, foresee what the person is going to do?
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.980]   Right, I am, you know, and, you know,
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.580]   and in discussions of free will, you know,
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.300]   it seems like both sides wanna, you know,
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.420]   very quickly dismiss that question as irrelevant.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.700]   Well, to me, it's totally relevant, okay?
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.900]   Because, you know, if someone says, oh, well, you know,
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.900]   a Laplace demon that knew the complete state of the universe,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.140]   you know, could predict everything you're going to do,
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.300]   therefore you don't have free will, you know,
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.420]   that it doesn't trouble me that much because, well, you know,
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.300]   I've never met such a demon, right?
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.780]   I, you know, and we, you know,
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.580]   we even have some reasons to think, you know,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.260]   maybe, you know, it could not exist as part of our world.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.740]   You know, it was only an abstraction, a thought experiment.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.860]   On the other hand, if someone said, well, you know,
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.180]   I have this brain scanning machine, you know,
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.180]   you step into it and then, you know,
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.220]   every paper that you will ever write, it will write,
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.420]   you know, every thought that you will have, you know,
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.740]   even right now about the machine itself, it will foresee,
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.620]   you know, well, if you could actually demonstrate that,
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.620]   then I think, you know, that sort of threatens
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.380]   my internal sense of having free will
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.580]   in a much more visceral way, you know,
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.980]   but now you notice that we're asking
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.620]   a much more empirical question.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.700]   We're asking, is such a machine possible or isn't it?
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.260]   We're asking, if it's not possible,
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.380]   then what in the laws of physics
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.220]   or what about the behavior of the brain,
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.020]   you know, prevents it from existing?
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.300]   - So if you could philosophize a little bit
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.780]   within this empirical question,
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.460]   where do you think would enter the,
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.860]   by which mechanism would enter the possibility
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.620]   that we can't predict the outcome?
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.260]   So there would be something
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.860]   that would be akin to a free will.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.460]   - Yeah, well, you could say the sort of obvious possibility,
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.660]   which was, you know, recognized by Eddington
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.060]   and many others about as soon as quantum mechanics
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:53.060]   was discovered in the 1920s, was that if, you know,
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.660]   let's say a sodium ion channel, you know,
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.900]   in the brain, right, you know,
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.020]   its behavior is chaotic, right?
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.420]   It's sort of, it's governed by these
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.980]   Hodgley-Huxkin equations in neuroscience, right,
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.540]   which are differential equations
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.820]   that have a stochastic component, right?
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.140]   Now, where does, you know, and this ultimately governs,
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.540]   let's say, whether a neuron will fire or not fire, right?
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.740]   - So that's the basic chemical process
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.900]   or electrical process by which signals
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.820]   are sent in the brain.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.820]   - Exactly, exactly, and, you know,
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.500]   and so you could ask, well, where does the randomness
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.100]   in the process, you know, that neuroscientists,
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.060]   or what neuroscientists would treat as randomness,
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.400]   where does it come from?
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.740]   You know, ultimately, it's thermal noise, right?
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.620]   Where does thermal noise come from?
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.900]   Well, ultimately, you know,
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.820]   there are some quantum mechanical events
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.660]   at the molecular level that are getting
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.460]   sort of chaotically amplified by, you know,
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:55.340]   a sort of butterfly effect, and so, you know,
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.260]   even if you knew the complete quantum state
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.140]   of someone's brain, you know, at best,
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.840]   you could predict the probabilities
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.460]   that they would do one thing or do another thing, right?
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.580]   I think that part is actually relatively uncontroversial,
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.380]   right, the controversial question is whether any of it
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.340]   matters for the sort of philosophical questions
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.220]   that we care about, because you could say,
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.400]   if all it's doing is just injecting some randomness
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.700]   into an otherwise completely mechanistic process,
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.180]   well, then who cares, right?
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.500]   And more concretely, if you could build a machine
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.380]   that, you know, could just calculate even just
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.860]   the probabilities of all of the possible things
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.040]   that you would do, right, and, you know,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.940]   you know, of all the things that said
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.860]   you had a 10% chance of doing,
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.980]   you did exactly a 10th of them, you know,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.580]   and so on and so on.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.340]   - Yeah, that somehow also takes away
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.180]   the feeling of free will.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.120]   - Exactly, I mean, to me, it seems essentially
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   just as bad as if the machine deterministically
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.920]   predicted you, it seems, you know,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.360]   hardly different from that.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   So then, but a more subtle question is,
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.240]   could you even learn enough about someone's brain
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.440]   to do that, okay, because, you know,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.240]   another central fact about quantum mechanics
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.160]   is that making a measurement on a quantum state
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.380]   is an inherently destructive operation, okay?
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.700]   So, you know, if I want to measure the, you know,
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.140]   position of a particle, right, it was,
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.580]   well, before I measured, it had a superposition
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.460]   over many different positions.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.040]   As soon as I measure, I localize it, right?
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.020]   So now I know the position, but I've also
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.300]   fundamentally changed the state.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.980]   And so you could say, well, maybe in trying to build
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.820]   a model of someone's brain that was accurate enough
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.080]   to actually, you know, make, let's say,
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.400]   even well-calibrated probabilistic predictions
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.760]   of their future behavior, maybe you would have
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.180]   to make measurements that were just so accurate
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.200]   that you would just fundamentally alter their brain, okay?
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.600]   Or maybe not, maybe you only, you know,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.440]   it would suffice to just make some nanorobots
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.740]   that just measured some sort of much larger scale,
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.320]   you know, macroscopic behavior, like, you know,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.280]   what is this neuron doing, what is that neuron doing?
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.900]   Maybe that would be enough.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.980]   See, but now, you know, what I claim is that
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.280]   we're now asking a question, you know,
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.680]   in which it is possible to envision
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.640]   what progress on it would look like.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.880]   - Yeah, but just as you said, that question may be
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.500]   slightly detached from the philosophical question
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.880]   in the sense if consciousness somehow has a role
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.080]   to the experience of free will.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.380]   Because ultimately, when we're talking about free will,
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.300]   we're also talking about not just the predictability
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.920]   of our actions, but somehow the experience
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.460]   of that predictability.
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.460]   - Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of philosophical questions
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.300]   ultimately, like feedback to the hard problem
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.280]   of consciousness, you know, and as much as you can try
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.200]   to sort of talk around it or not, right?
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.860]   And, you know, and there is a reason why people try
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.600]   to talk around it, which is that, you know,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.800]   Democritus talked about the hard problem of consciousness,
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.180]   you know, in 400 BC in terms that would be
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.900]   totally recognizable to us today, right?
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.960]   And it's really not clear if there's been progress since
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.540]   or what progress could possibly consist of.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.420]   - Is there a Q prime type of sub-question
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.400]   that could help us get at consciousness?
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.680]   It's something about consciousness.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.740]   - Well, I mean, well, I mean, there is the whole question
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.640]   of, you know, of AI, right?
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.680]   Of, you know, can you build a human level
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.960]   or superhuman level AI?
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.140]   And, you know, can it work in a completely different
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.420]   substrate from the brain?
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.460]   I mean, you know, and of course that was Alan Turing's point
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.260]   and, you know, and even if that was done, it's, you know,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.660]   maybe people would still argue about the hard problem
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.940]   of consciousness, right?
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.120]   And yet, you know, my claim is a little different.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.860]   My claim is that in a world where, you know,
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.980]   there were, you know, human level AIs
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.980]   or where we'd been even overtaken by such AIs,
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.940]   the entire discussion of the hard problem of consciousness
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.640]   would have a different character, right?
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.440]   It would take place in different terms in such a world,
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.720]   even if we hadn't answered the question.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.620]   And my claim about free will would be similar, right?
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.040]   That if this prediction machine that I was talking about
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.980]   could actually be built, well, now the entire discussion
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.620]   of the, you know, of free will is sort of transformed
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.340]   by that, you know, even if in some sense
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.180]   the metaphysical question hasn't been answered.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.940]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.240]   It transforms it fundamentally because say that machine
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.620]   does tell you that it can predict perfectly
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.100]   and yet there is this deep experience of free will
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.100]   and then that changes the question completely.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.540]   And it starts actually getting to the question of
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:52.220]   the AGI, the Turing questions,
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.900]   the demonstration of free will,
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.540]   the demonstration of intelligence,
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.500]   the demonstration of consciousness.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.280]   Does that equal consciousness, intelligence, and free will?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.820]   - But see, Alex, if every time I was contemplating
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.380]   a decision, you know, this machine had printed out
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.540]   an envelope, you know, where I could open it
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.220]   and see that it knew my decision,
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.500]   I think that actually would change my subjective experience
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.180]   of making decisions, right?
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.260]   I mean, it would-- - Does knowledge
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.860]   change your subjective experience?
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.460]   - Well, you know, I mean, the knowledge that this machine
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.020]   had predicted everything I would do,
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.780]   I mean, it might drive me completely insane, right?
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.700]   But at any rate, it would change my experience
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.880]   to not just discuss such a machine as a thought experiment
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.120]   but to actually see it.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.920]   - Yeah.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.120]   (laughing)
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.720]   - I mean, you know, you could say at that point,
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.920]   you know, you could say, you know,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.280]   why not simply call this machine a second instantiation
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.120]   of me and be done with it, right?
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.400]   What, you know, why even privilege the original me
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.880]   over this perfect duplicate that exists in the machine?
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.080]   - Yeah, or there could be a religious experience with it too.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.440]   It's kind of what God throughout the generations
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.400]   is supposed to have, that God kind of represents
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.580]   that perfect machine, is able to, I guess, actually,
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:15.280]   I don't even know, what are the religious interpretations
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.240]   of free will?
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:22.600]   So if God knows perfectly everything in religion,
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   in the various religions, where does free will fit into that?
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.440]   Do you know?
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.280]   - That has been one of the big things
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.080]   that theologians have argued about for thousands of years.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.360]   (laughing)
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.280]   You know, I am not a theologian,
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.120]   so maybe I shouldn't go there.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.880]   - So there's not a clear answer in a book like--
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.920]   - I mean, this is, you know, the Calvinists debated this,
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.800]   the, you know, this has been, you know,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.120]   I mean, different religious movements
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   have taken different positions on that question,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.080]   but that is how they think about it.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.400]   You know, meanwhile, you know, a large part of sort of
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.560]   what animates, you know, theoretical computer science,
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.440]   you could say, is, you know, we're asking sort of,
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.040]   what are the ultimate limits of, you know,
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.480]   what you can know or, you know, calculate or figure out
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.140]   by, you know, entities that you can actually build
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.700]   in the physical world, right?
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.820]   And if I were trying to explain it to a theologian,
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.240]   maybe I would say, you know, we are studying, you know,
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.440]   to what extent, you know,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.800]   gods can be made manifest in the physical world.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.440]   I'm not sure my colleagues would like that.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.700]   (laughing)
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.600]   - So let's talk about quantum computers for a minute.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.320]   - Yeah, sure, sure.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.200]   - As you've said, quantum computing,
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.280]   at least in the 1990s, was a profound story
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.960]   at the intersection of computer science,
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.320]   physics, engineering, math, and philosophy.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.280]   So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.560]   that represents more than just the quantum computer.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.400]   - Yes.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.160]   - But can we start at the very basics?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.680]   What is quantum computing?
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.680]   - Yeah, so it's a proposal for a new type of computation,
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.120]   or let's say a new way to harness nature to do computation
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.200]   that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.520]   Okay, now the principles of quantum mechanics
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.040]   have been in place since 1926.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.080]   You know, they haven't changed.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.120]   You know, what's new is, you know, how we wanna use them.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.640]   Okay, so what does quantum mechanics say about the world?
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.560]   You know, the physicists, I think, over the generations,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.200]   you know, convinced people that that is an unbelievably
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.160]   complicated question, and you know,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.680]   just give up on trying to understand it.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.480]   I can let you in, not being a physicist,
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.880]   I can let you in on a secret,
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.480]   which is that it becomes a lot simpler
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.720]   if you do what we do in quantum information theory
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.840]   and sort of take the physics out of it.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.160]   So the way that we think about quantum mechanics
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.800]   is sort of as a generalization of the rules
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.700]   of probability themselves.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.920]   So, you know, you might say there's a, you know,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.280]   there was a 30% chance that it was going to snow today
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.120]   or something.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.920]   You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance,
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.880]   right, that would be nonsense.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.720]   Much less would you say that there was a, you know,
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.200]   an i% chance, you know, square root of minus 1% chance.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   Now, the central discovery that sort of quantum mechanics
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.400]   made is that fundamentally the world is described by,
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.240]   or you know, the sort of, let's say the possibilities
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   for, you know, what a system could be doing
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.880]   are described using numbers called amplitudes, okay,
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.420]   which are like probabilities in some ways,
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.180]   but they are not probabilities.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.820]   They can be positive, for one thing,
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.900]   they can be positive or negative.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.760]   In fact, they can even be complex numbers, okay?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.360]   And if you've heard of a quantum superposition,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.560]   this just means that some state of affairs
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.760]   where you assign an amplitude,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.960]   one of these complex numbers to every possible
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.680]   configuration that you could see a system in
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   on measuring it.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.040]   So for example, you might say that an electron
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.760]   has some amplitude for being here
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.600]   and some other amplitude for being there, right?
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.080]   Now, if you look to see where it is,
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.800]   you will localize it, right?
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.460]   You will sort of force the amplitudes
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.560]   to be converted into probabilities.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.760]   That happens by taking their squared absolute value, okay?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.840]   And then, you know, you can say
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.960]   either the electron will be here or it will be there.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.560]   And, you know, knowing the amplitudes,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.920]   you can predict at least the probabilities
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.260]   that you'll see each possible outcome, okay?
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.880]   But while a system is isolated
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.020]   from the whole rest of the universe,
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.760]   the rest of its environment,
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.160]   the amplitudes can change in time
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.740]   by rules that are different
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.760]   from the normal rules of probability
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.840]   and that are, you know, alien to our everyday experience.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.680]   So anytime anyone ever tells you anything
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.280]   about the weirdness of the quantum world, you know,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.240]   or assuming that they're not lying to you, right?
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.000]   They are telling you, you know,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.440]   yet another consequence of nature
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.360]   being described by these amplitudes.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.120]   So most famously, what amplitudes can do
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.360]   is that they can interfere with each other, okay?
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.560]   So in the famous double slit experiment,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.840]   what happens is that you shoot a particle,
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.520]   like an electron, let's say,
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.800]   at a screen with two slits in it,
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.280]   and you find that there, you know, on a second screen,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.920]   now there are certain places
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.600]   where that electron will never end up, you know,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.680]   after it passes through the first screen.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.700]   And yet, if I close off one of the slits,
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.560]   then the electron can appear in that place, okay?
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.280]   So by decreasing the number of paths
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.820]   that the electron could take to get somewhere,
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.520]   you can increase the chance that it gets there, okay?
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.420]   Now, how is that possible?
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.840]   Well, it's because, you know, as we would say now,
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.880]   the electron has a superposition state, okay?
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.120]   It has some amplitude for reaching this point
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.880]   by going through the first slit.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.960]   It has some other amplitude for reaching it
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.800]   by going through the second slit.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.080]   But now if one amplitude is positive
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.800]   and the other one is negative,
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.160]   then, you know, I have to add them all up, right?
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.880]   I have to add the amplitudes for every path
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.880]   that the electron could have taken to reach this point.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.800]   And those amplitudes,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.900]   if they're pointing in different directions,
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.840]   they can cancel each other out.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.220]   That would mean the total amplitude is zero
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.340]   and the thing never happens at all.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.460]   I close off one of the possibilities,
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.920]   then the amplitude is positive or it's negative
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.580]   and now the thing can happen.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.140]   Okay, so that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.140]   And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is, okay?
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.340]   A quantum computer is a computer
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.480]   that tries to exploit, you know,
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.720]   these, exactly these phenomena,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.200]   superposition, amplitudes, and interference
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.400]   in order to solve certain problems
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.520]   much faster than we know how to solve them otherwise.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.020]   So it's the basic building block of a quantum computer
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.200]   is what we call a quantum bit or a qubit.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.600]   That just means a bit that has some amplitude
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.120]   for being zero and some other amplitude for being one.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.480]   So it's a superposition of zero and one states, right?
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.560]   But now the key point is that if I've got,
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.000]   let's say, a thousand qubits,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.320]   the rules of quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.740]   that I do not just need one, you know,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.800]   I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit separately.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.360]   Okay, in general, I need an amplitude
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.520]   for every possible setting of all thousand of those bits.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.120]   Okay, so that what that means
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   is two to the 1,000 power amplitudes.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.880]   Okay, if I had to write those down,
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.680]   let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.000]   if I had to write down two to the 1,000 complex numbers,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.640]   that would not fit within the entire observable universe.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.120]   Okay, and yet, you know, quantum mechanics is unequivocal
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   that if these qubits can all interact with each other,
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.280]   and in some sense, I need two to the 1,000 parameters,
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.440]   you know, amplitudes to describe what is going on.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.840]   Now, you know, now I can tell you, you know,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.440]   where all the popular articles, you know,
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.720]   about quantum computing go off the rails is that they say,
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.200]   you know, they sort of say what I just said,
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.920]   and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer works
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.200]   is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.320]   So, you know, that sounds too good to be true,
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.960]   and unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.280]   The problem is I could make a superposition
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.280]   over every possible answer to my problem,
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.000]   you know, even if there were two to the 1,000 of them,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.080]   right, I can easily do that.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.520]   The trouble is for a computer to be useful,
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.640]   you've got, at some point, you've got to look at it
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.760]   and see an output, right, and if I just measure
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.080]   a superposition over every possible answer,
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.000]   then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.720]   that all I'll see will be a random answer.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.360]   You know, if I just wanted a random answer,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.800]   well, I could have picked one myself
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.640]   with a lot less trouble, right?
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.280]   So the entire trick with quantum computing,
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.000]   with every algorithm for a quantum computer
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   is that you try to choreograph a pattern
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.600]   of interference of amplitudes,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.680]   and you try to do it so that for each wrong answer,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.280]   some of the paths leading to that wrong answer
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.960]   have positive amplitudes,
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.120]   and others have negative amplitudes.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.760]   So on the whole, they cancel each other out, okay,
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.600]   whereas all the paths leading to the right answer
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.800]   should reinforce each other, you know,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.240]   should have amplitudes pointing the same direction.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.800]   - So the design of algorithms in the space
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.240]   is the choreography of the interferences.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.280]   - Precisely, that's precisely what it is.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.800]   - Can we take a brief step back?
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.920]   And you mentioned information.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.760]   - Yes.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.320]   - So in which part of this beautiful picture
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.760]   that you've painted is information contained?
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.640]   - Oh, well, information is at the core of everything
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.120]   that we've been talking about, right?
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.080]   I mean, the bit is, you know,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.400]   the basic unit of information,
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.080]   since, you know, Claude Shannon's paper in 1948,
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.240]   you know, and you know, of course,
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.320]   people had the concept even before that,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.280]   you know, he popularized the name, right?
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.120]   But I mean--
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.080]   - But a bit is zero or one, so that's the basic element.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.480]   - That's right, and what we would say
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.640]   is that the basic unit of quantum information is the qubit,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.120]   is, you know, the object, any object
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.840]   that can be maintained in a,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.120]   manipulated in a superposition of zero and one states.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   Now, you know, sometimes people ask,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   well, but what is a qubit physically, right?
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.640]   And there are all these different, you know,
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.800]   proposals that are being pursued in parallel
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.000]   for how you implement qubits.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.760]   There is, you know, superconducting quantum computing
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.520]   that was in the news recently
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.040]   because of Google's quantum supremacy experiment, right?
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.560]   Where you would have some little coils
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.320]   where a current can flow through them
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.400]   in two different energy states,
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.640]   one representing a zero, another representing a one,
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.960]   and if you cool these coils to just slightly above
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   absolute zero, like a hundredth of a degree,
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.840]   then they superconduct, and then the current
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.400]   can actually be in a superposition
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.840]   of the two different states.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.400]   So that's one kind of qubit.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.560]   Another kind would be, you know,
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.800]   just an individual atomic nucleus, right?
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.120]   It has a spin, it could be spinning clockwise,
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.240]   it could be spinning counterclockwise,
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.080]   or it could be in a superposition of the two spin states.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.640]   That is another qubit.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.320]   But see, just like in the classical world, right,
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.920]   you could be a virtuoso programmer
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.520]   without having any idea of what a transistor is, right,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.120]   or how the bits are physically represented
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.480]   inside the machine,
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.360]   even that the machine uses electricity, right?
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.120]   You just care about the logic.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.360]   It's sort of the same with quantum computing, right?
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.040]   Qubits could be realized
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.440]   by many, many different quantum systems,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.580]   and yet all of those systems will lead to the same logic,
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.360]   you know, the logic of qubits,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.720]   and how you measure them,
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.560]   how you change them over time.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.720]   And so, you know, the subject of how qubits behave
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.560]   and what you can do with qubits,
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.320]   that is quantum information.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.040]   - So just to linger on that.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.880]   - Sure.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.640]   - So the physical design implementation of a qubit
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:20.600]   does not interfere with that next level of abstraction
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.560]   that you can program over it.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.040]   So it truly is, the idea of it is,
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.480]   okay.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.880]   - Well, to be honest with you,
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   today they do interfere with each other.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.920]   That's because all the quantum computers we can build today
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.520]   are very noisy, right?
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.960]   And so sort of the, you know,
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:41.080]   the qubits are very far from perfect.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.120]   And so the lower level sort of does affect the higher levels
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.680]   and we sort of have to think about all of them at once.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.360]   Okay, but eventually where we hope to get
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.680]   is to what are called error-corrected quantum computers,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.720]   where the qubits really do behave
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.960]   like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them to.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.720]   And in that future, you know,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.120]   a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.480]   or think about today, but in that future,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.320]   the logic of it really does become decoupled
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.160]   from the hardware.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.360]   - So if noise is currently like the biggest problem
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   for quantum computing,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.200]   and then the dream is error-correcting quantum computers,
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.760]   can you just maybe describe what does it mean
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.880]   for there to be noise in the system?
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.840]   - Absolutely.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.680]   So yeah, so the problem is even a little more specific
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.520]   than noise.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.400]   So the fundamental problem,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.480]   if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer,
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.320]   you know, of any appreciable size,
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.840]   is something called decoherence.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.400]   Okay, and this was recognized from the very beginning,
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.600]   you know, when people first started thinking about this
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.100]   in the 1990s.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.160]   Now, what decoherence means is sort of
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.000]   the unwanted interaction between, you know, your qubits,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.320]   you know, the state of your quantum computer
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.240]   and the external environment.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.280]   Okay, and why is that such a problem?
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.360]   Well, I talked before about how, you know,
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.840]   when you measure a quantum system,
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.080]   so let's say if I measure a qubit
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.320]   that's in a superposition of zero and one states
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.860]   to ask it, you know, are you zero or are you one?
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.240]   Well, now I force it to make up its mind, right?
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.040]   And now probabilistically,
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.000]   it chooses one or the other.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.480]   And now, you know, it's no longer a superposition,
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.200]   there's no longer amplitudes,
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.680]   there's just, there's some probability that I get a zero
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.380]   and there's some that I get a one.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:35.320]   And now, the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.440]   who's looking, okay?
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.140]   Or in fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:44.340]   Any kind of interaction with the external world
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.720]   that leaks out the information
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.040]   about whether this qubit was a zero or a one,
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.440]   sort of that causes the zeroness or the oneness
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.340]   of the qubit to be recorded in, you know,
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.560]   the radiation in the room, in the molecules of the air,
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.900]   in the wires that are connected to my device, any of that.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.120]   As soon as the information leaks out,
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   it is as if that qubit has been measured, okay?
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.240]   It is, you know, the state has now collapsed.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.120]   You know, another way to say it is that it's become
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.480]   entangled with its environment, okay?
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.960]   But, you know, from the perspective of someone
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.600]   who's just looking at this qubit,
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.880]   it is as though it has lost its quantum state.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.840]   And so, what this means is that if I want to do
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.680]   a quantum computation, I have to keep the qubits
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.600]   sort of fanatically well isolated from their environment.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.480]   But then at the same time, they can't be perfectly isolated
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.680]   because I need to tell them what to do.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.960]   I need to make them interact with each other, for one thing,
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.880]   and not only that, but in a precisely choreographed way.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.080]   Okay, and, you know, that is such a staggering problem,
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.480]   right, how do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.920]   but then also tell them exactly what to do?
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.580]   I mean, you know, there were distinguished physicists
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.760]   and computer scientists in the '90s who said
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.200]   this is fundamentally impossible, you know?
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.700]   The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.300]   to the degree of accuracy that you're talking about.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.740]   Now, what changed the views of most of us
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:22.340]   was a profound discovery in the mid to late '90s,
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.500]   which was called the theory of quantum error correction
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.740]   and quantum fault tolerance, okay?
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.420]   And the upshot of that theory is that if I want to build
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.820]   a reliable quantum computer and scale it up
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.540]   to, you know, an arbitrary number of as many qubits
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:41.100]   as I want, you know, and doing as much on them as I want,
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.340]   I do not actually have to get the qubits perfectly isolated
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.220]   from their environment.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.060]   It is enough to get them really, really,
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.140]   really well isolated, okay?
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:55.100]   And even if every qubit is sort of leaking, you know,
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.960]   its state into the environment at some rate,
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.580]   as long as that rate is low enough, okay,
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:05.060]   I can sort of encode the information that I care about
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.460]   in very clever ways across the collective states
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.980]   of multiple qubits, okay, in such a way that even if,
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.140]   you know, a small percentage of my qubits leak,
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.360]   well, I'm constantly monitoring them to see
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.500]   if that leak happened.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.060]   I can detect it and I can correct it.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.420]   I can recover the information I care about
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.500]   from the remaining qubits, okay?
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.340]   And so, you know, you can build a reliable quantum computer
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.820]   even out of unreliable parts, right?
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.820]   Now, in some sense, you know, that discovery
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.180]   is what set the engineering agenda
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.100]   for quantum computing research
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.740]   from the 1990s until the present, okay?
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.740]   The goal has been, you know, engineer qubits
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:50.700]   that are not perfectly reliable, but reliable enough
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.900]   that you can then use these error correcting codes
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.740]   to have them simulate qubits that are even more reliable
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.100]   than they are, right? - Got it.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.140]   - The error correction becomes a net win
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.820]   rather than a net loss, right?
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.940]   And then once you reach that sort of crossover point,
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.340]   then, you know, your simulated qubits
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.640]   could in turn simulate qubits that are even more reliable
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.740]   and so on until you've just, you know,
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.140]   effectively you have arbitrarily reliable qubits.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:20.780]   So long story short, we are not at that break-even point yet.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.700]   We're a hell of a lot closer than we were
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.820]   when people started doing this in the '90s,
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.420]   like orders of magnitude closer.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.140]   - But the key ingredient there is the more qubits,
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.700]   the better because--
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.220]   - Ah, well, the more qubits,
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.260]   the larger the computation you can do, right?
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.980]   I mean, qubits are what constitute the memory
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.500]   of your quantum computer, right?
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.260]   - But also for the, sorry, for the error correcting mechanism.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.180]   - Ah, yes.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.400]   So the way I would say it is that error correction
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.420]   imposes an overhead in the number of qubits.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.520]   And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.700]   with building a scalable quantum computer.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.180]   If you look at the error correcting codes,
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.580]   at least the ones that we know about today,
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.740]   and you look at what would it take
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.620]   to actually use a quantum computer
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:09.300]   to hack your credit card number,
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.140]   which is maybe the most famous application
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.380]   people talk about, right?
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.380]   Let's say to factor huge numbers
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:18.060]   and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.620]   Well, what that would take would be thousands of,
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.220]   several thousand logical qubits.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.620]   But now with the known error correcting codes,
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:30.140]   each of those logical qubits would need to be encoded itself
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.440]   using thousands of physical qubits.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.940]   So at that point, you're talking about
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.980]   millions of physical qubits.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.140]   And in some sense, that is the reason why
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.980]   quantum computers are not breaking cryptography already.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.940]   It's because of these immense overheads involved.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.460]   - So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.580]   - Well, it's multiplicative.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.960]   I mean, it's like you take the number of logical qubits
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.540]   that you need in your abstract quantum circuit,
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.860]   you multiply it by a thousand or so.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.980]   So, you know, there's a lot of work on, you know,
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.060]   inventing better, trying to invent better
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.500]   error correcting codes.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.300]   Okay, that is the situation right now.
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.660]   In the meantime, we are now in what the physicist
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.780]   John Preskill called the noisy intermediate scale
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.660]   quantum or NISQ era.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.540]   And this is the era, you can think of it
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.160]   as sort of like the vacuum, you know,
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.420]   we're now entering the very early vacuum tube era
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.880]   of quantum computers.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.780]   The quantum computer analog of the transistor
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.600]   has not been invented yet, right?
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.220]   That would be like true error correction, right?
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.640]   Where, you know, we are not, or something else
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.580]   that would achieve the same effect, right?
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.540]   We are not there yet.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.300]   And, but where we are now, let's say as of a few months ago,
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.740]   you know, as of Google's announcement of quantum supremacy,
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.860]   you know, we are now finally at the point
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.400]   where even with a non-error corrected quantum computer
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.420]   with, you know, these noisy devices,
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:55.180]   we can do something that is hard for classical computers
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.580]   to simulate, okay?
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.740]   So we can eke out some advantage.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.320]   Now, will we in this noisy era be able to do something
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.340]   beyond what a classical computer can do
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.540]   that is also useful to someone?
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.820]   That we still don't know.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.620]   People are going to be racing over the next decade
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.700]   to try to do that by people, I mean, Google, IBM,
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.660]   you know, a bunch of startup companies, you know--
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.660]   - And research labs.
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.660]   - Yeah, and research labs and governments and yeah.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.140]   - You just mentioned a million things.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.740]   Well, I'll backtrack for a second.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.260]   - Yeah, sure, sure.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.700]   - So we're in these vacuum tube days.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.180]   - Yeah, just entering though.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.260]   - And just entering, wow, okay.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.500]   So how do we escape the vacuum?
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:41.500]   So how do we get to where we are now with the CPU?
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.820]   Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.260]   Is there breakthroughs on the physics side
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.180]   that are needed on the computer science side?
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.740]   What's, is it a financial issue where a much larger,
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:01.180]   just sheer investment and excitement is needed?
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.820]   - So, you know, those are excellent questions.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.180]   My guess-- - With no answers.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.420]   - Well, no, no, my guess would be all of the above.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.380]   I mean, my guess, you know, I mean, you know,
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.960]   you could say fundamentally it is an engineering issue,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.140]   right, the theory has been in place since the '90s,
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.220]   you know, at least, you know, this is what,
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.500]   you know, error correction would look like,
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.900]   you know, we do not have the hardware that is at that level,
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.460]   but at the same time, you know, so you could just,
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.700]   you know, try to power through, you know,
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.060]   maybe even like, you know, if someone spent a trillion
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.260]   dollars on some quantum computing Manhattan project,
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:43.100]   right, then conceivably they could just, you know,
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.580]   build an error-corrected quantum computer
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.700]   as it was envisioned back in the '90s, right?
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.540]   I think the more plausible thing to happen
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.580]   is that there will be further theoretical breakthroughs,
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.500]   and there will be further insights that will cut down
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.100]   the cost of doing this.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.100]   - So let's take a brief step to the philosophical.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.520]   I just recently talked to Jim Keller,
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.780]   who's sort of like the famed architect
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:14.500]   in the microprocessor world, and he's been told
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.180]   for decades every year that the Moore's Law
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:22.220]   is going to die this year, and he tries to argue
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.780]   that the Moore's Law is still alive and well,
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.460]   and it'll be alive for quite a long time to come.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.140]   - How long, how long did he say?
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.860]   - Well, the main point is it's still alive,
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:38.140]   but he thinks there's still a thousand X improvement
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.060]   just on shrinking the transition, that's possible.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:45.540]   Whatever, the point is that the exponential growth we see
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.820]   is actually a huge number of these S curves,
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.780]   just constant breakthroughs.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.380]   At the philosophical level, why do you think we,
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.660]   as a descendants of apes, were able to just keep coming up
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.620]   with these new breakthroughs on the CPU side?
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.140]   Is this something unique to this particular endeavor,
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.820]   or will it be possible to replicate
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.820]   in the quantum computer space?
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.020]   - Okay, all right, there was a lot there,
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.380]   but to break off something, I mean,
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.060]   I think we are in an extremely special period
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.620]   of human history, right?
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.220]   I mean, it is, you could say, obviously special,
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.380]   you know, in many ways, right?
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.980]   There are, you know, way more people alive
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.900]   than there have been, and, you know,
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:41.820]   the whole future of the planet is in question
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.620]   in a way that it hasn't been, you know,
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:48.100]   for the rest of human history, but, you know,
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.220]   in particular, you know, we are in the era
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.060]   where, you know, we finally figured out
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.860]   how to build, you know, universal machines,
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.420]   you could say, you know, the things that we call computers,
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.460]   you know, machines that you program
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:07.100]   to simulate the behavior of whatever machine you want,
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:12.100]   and, you know, and once you've sort of crossed
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.300]   this threshold of universality, you know,
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.780]   you've built, you could say, you know,
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.620]   Turing, you've instantiated Turing machines
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.380]   in the physical world, well, then the main questions
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.100]   are ones of numbers.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.540]   They are, you know, ones of how many,
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.620]   how much memory can you access?
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.260]   How fast does it run?
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.260]   How many parallel processors?
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.940]   You know, at least until quantum computing.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.100]   Quantum computing is the one thing that changes
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.700]   what I just said, right?
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.500]   But, you know, as long as it's classical computing,
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.740]   then it's all questions of numbers.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.860]   And, you know, you could say at a theoretical level,
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.540]   the computers that we have today
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.820]   are the same as the ones in the '50s.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.020]   They're just millions of times, you know,
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.340]   faster with millions of times more memory.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.380]   And, you know, I mean, I think there's been
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.620]   an immense economic pressure to, you know,
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.940]   get more and more transistors, you know,
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.300]   get them smaller and smaller, you know,
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.140]   add more and more cores.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:13.460]   And, you know, and in some sense, like,
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.980]   a huge fraction of sort of all of the technological progress
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.420]   that there is in all of civilization
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.420]   has gotten concentrated just more narrowly
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:25.060]   into just those problems, right?
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.540]   And so, you know, it has been one of the biggest
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.500]   success stories in the history of technology, right?
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.940]   There's, you know, I mean, it is,
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.820]   I am as amazed by it as anyone else is, right?
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.580]   But at the same time, you know, we also know that it,
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:45.540]   you know, and I really do mean we know
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.580]   that it cannot continue indefinitely, okay?
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:52.340]   Because you will reach, you know, fundamental limits
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:56.900]   on, you know, how small you can possibly make a processor.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.140]   And, you know, if you want a real proof, you know,
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:01.460]   that would justify my use of the word, you know,
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.260]   we know that, you know, Moore's law has to end.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.420]   I mean, ultimately, you will reach the limits
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:08.900]   imposed by quantum gravity, you know?
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.940]   You know, if you were doing,
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.540]   if you tried to build a computer that operated
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.820]   at 10 to the 43 Hertz,
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.780]   so it did 10 to the 43 operations per second,
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.980]   that computer would use so much energy
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.460]   that it would simply collapse to a black hole, okay?
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.420]   So, you know, that, you know, in reality,
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.980]   we're going to reach the limits long before that.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.060]   But, you know, that is a sufficient proof.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.460]   - That there's a limit.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.700]   - Yes, yes.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:38.380]   - But it would be interesting to try to understand
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.940]   the mechanism, the economic pressure that you said,
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.060]   just like the Cold War was a pressure on getting us,
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.660]   getting us, 'cause I'm both,
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:51.100]   my us is both the Soviet Union and the United States,
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.660]   but getting us, the two countries,
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.700]   to get, to hurry up to get to space, to the moon,
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.320]   there seems to be that same kind of economic pressure
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.780]   that somehow created a chain of engineering breakthroughs
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.100]   that resulted in the Moore's law.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:06.940]   - Yeah. - It'd be nice
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:07.760]   to replicate.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.780]   - Yeah, well, I mean, some people are sort of,
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:14.780]   get depressed about the fact that technological progress,
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.860]   you know, may seem to have slowed down
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.260]   in many, many realms outside of computing, right?
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.460]   There was this whole thing of, you know,
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.620]   we wanted flying cars and we only got Twitter instead,
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.460]   right? (laughs)
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.620]   - Yeah, good old Peter Thiel, yeah.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.220]   So, then jumping to another really interesting topic
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:36.540]   that you mentioned, so Google announced
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.360]   with their work in the paper in Nature
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.900]   with quantum supremacy.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.520]   - Yes. - Can you describe,
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.200]   again, back to the basic, what is,
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.080]   perhaps not so basic, what is quantum supremacy?
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.180]   - Absolutely, so quantum supremacy is a term
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.700]   that was coined by, again, by John Preskill in 2012.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.000]   Not everyone likes the name, you know,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.400]   but it sort of stuck, you know,
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.360]   we don't, we sort of haven't found a better alternative.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.600]   - It's technically quantum computational supremacy.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.720]   - Yeah, yeah, supremacy, that's right, that's right.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.520]   But the basic idea is actually one that goes
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.640]   all the way back to the beginnings of quantum computing
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.600]   when Richard Feynman and David Deutch, people like that,
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.840]   were talking about it in the early '80s.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.720]   And quantum supremacy just refers to sort of the point
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.540]   in history when you can first use a quantum computer
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:36.560]   to do some well-defined task much faster
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.360]   than any known algorithm running on any
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.320]   of the classical computers that are available, okay?
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.360]   So, you know, notice that I did not say a useful task, okay?
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.120]   You know, it could be something completely artificial,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.920]   but it's important that the task be well-defined.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.680]   So in other words, you know, there is,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.600]   it is something that has right and wrong answers,
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:00.320]   you know, that are knowable independently of this device,
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.520]   right, and we can then, you know, run the device,
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.480]   see if it gets the right answer or not.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.080]   - Can you clarify a small point?
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.560]   You said much faster than a classical implementation.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.840]   What about, sort of, what about the space
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.200]   with where the class, there's no, there's not,
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.920]   it doesn't even exist a classical algorithm to--
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.320]   - So maybe I should clarify, everything
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.040]   that a quantum computer can do,
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.720]   a classical computer can also eventually do, okay?
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.040]   And the reason why we know that is
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.360]   that a classical computer could always, you know,
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.600]   if it had no limits of time and memory,
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.300]   it could always just store the entire quantum state,
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.320]   you know, of your, you know, of the quantum,
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.280]   right, store a list of all the amplitudes, you know,
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.320]   in the state of the quantum computer,
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.160]   and then just, you know, do some linear algebra
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.240]   to just update that state, right?
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.500]   And so, so anything that quantum computers can do
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.380]   can also be done by classical computers,
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.720]   albeit exponentially slower in some cases.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.840]   - So quantum computers don't go to some magical place
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.760]   outside of Alan Turing's definition of computation.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.600]   - Precisely.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.040]   They do not solve the halting problem.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.800]   They cannot solve anything that is uncomputable
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.460]   in Alan Turing's sense.
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.760]   What they, what we think they do change
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.360]   is what is efficiently computable, okay?
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.440]   And, you know, since the 1960s, you know,
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.200]   the word efficiently, you know,
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.040]   as well as been a central word in computer science,
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.120]   but it's sort of a code word for something technical,
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.920]   which is basically with polynomial scaling, you know,
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.880]   that as you get to larger and larger inputs,
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.840]   you would like an algorithm that uses an amount of time
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.440]   that scales only like the size of the input
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.320]   raised to some power, and not exponentially
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.400]   with the size of the input, right?
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.880]   - Yeah, so I do hope we get to talk again,
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.720]   because one of the many topics
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:56.000]   that there's probably several hours worth of conversation on
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.400]   is complexity, which we probably won't even get a chance
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.720]   to touch today, but you briefly mentioned it.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.360]   But let's maybe try to continue.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.680]   So you said the definition of quantum supremacy
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:13.600]   is basically achieving a place where much faster
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.560]   on a formal, that quantum computers much faster
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.200]   on a formal, well-defined problem that is or isn't useful.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.400]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.360]   And I would say that we really want three things, right?
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.040]   We want, first of all, the quantum computer
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.640]   to be much faster, just in the literal sense
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.800]   of like number of seconds, you know,
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.040]   at just solving this, you know, well-defined, you know,
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:36.960]   problem.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.640]   Secondly, we want it to be sort of, you know,
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.880]   for a problem where we really believe
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.080]   that a quantum computer has better scaling behavior, right?
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.800]   So it's not just an incidental, you know,
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.240]   matter of hardware, but it's that, you know,
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.320]   as you went to larger and larger inputs, you know,
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.360]   the classical scaling would be exponential
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.840]   and the scaling for the quantum algorithm
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.680]   would only be polynomial.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.200]   And then thirdly, we want the first thing,
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.160]   the actual observed speed up to only be explainable
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.720]   in terms of the scaling behavior, right?
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.960]   So, you know, I want, you know, a real world,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.640]   you know, a real problem to get solved,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.640]   let's say by a quantum computer with 50 qubits or so,
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.680]   and for no one to be able to explain that in any way
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.440]   other than, well, you know, to,
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   this computer involved a quantum state
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.280]   with two to the 50th power amplitudes,
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.320]   and, you know, a classical simulation,
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.180]   at least any that we know today,
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.560]   would require keeping track of two to the 50th numbers,
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.560]   and this is the reason why it was faster.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.200]   - So the intuition is that then if you demonstrate
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.480]   on 50 qubits, then once you get to 100 qubits,
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.880]   then it'll be even much more faster.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.560]   - Precisely, precisely.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.120]   Yeah, and, you know, and quantum supremacy
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.320]   does not require error correction, right?
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.640]   We don't, you know, we don't have,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.800]   you could say true scalability yet,
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.720]   or true, you know, error correction yet,
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.680]   but you could say quantum supremacy
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:11.000]   is already enough by itself to refute the skeptics
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.360]   who said a quantum computer will never outperform
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.320]   a classical computer for anything.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   - But one, how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy,
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.960]   and two, what's up with these news articles
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960]   I'm reading that Google did so?
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:26.800]   - Yeah, all right, well--
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.880]   - What did they actually do?
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.200]   - Great, great questions, 'cause now you get into,
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.040]   actually, you know, a lot of the work that I've,
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.840]   you know, I and my students have been doing
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.920]   for the last decade, which was precisely about
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.400]   how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   using technologies that, you know,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.260]   we thought would be available in the near future?
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:52.080]   And so one of the main things that we realized
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.720]   around 2011, and this was me and my student,
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.960]   Alex Arkhipov at MIT at the time,
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.280]   and independently of some others,
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.320]   including Bremner, Josa, and Shepard, okay?
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   And the realization that we came to
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.120]   was that if you just want to prove
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.240]   that a quantum computer is faster, you know,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.280]   and not do something useful with it,
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.400]   then there are huge advantages
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.520]   to sort of switching your attention
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.080]   from problems like factoring numbers
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.160]   that have a single right answer
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.720]   to what we call sampling problems.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.040]   So these are problems where the goal
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.120]   is just to output a sample
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.540]   from some probability distribution,
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:38.200]   let's say over strings of 50 bits, right?
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.160]   So there are, you know, many, many,
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.240]   many possible valid outputs.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.720]   You know, your computer will probably
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.440]   never even produce the same output twice,
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.360]   you know, if it's running as,
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.960]   even, you know, assuming it's running perfectly, okay?
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.280]   But the key is that some outputs
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.800]   are supposed to be likelier than other ones.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.820]   So-- - So sorry, to clarify,
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.680]   is there a set of outputs that are valid
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.880]   and a set that are not?
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.060]   Or is it more that the distribution
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:11.300]   of a particular kind of output is more,
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.420]   is there's a specific distribution
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.260]   of a particular kind of output?
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.740]   - Yeah, there's a specific distribution
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.140]   that you're trying to hit, right?
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.140]   Or, you know, that you're trying to sample from.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.660]   Now, there are a lot of questions about this.
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.660]   You know, how do you do that, right?
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.820]   Now, how you do it, you know,
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.340]   it turns out that with a quantum computer,
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.380]   even with the noisy quantum computers
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.960]   that we have now, that we have today,
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.080]   what you can do is basically just apply
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.400]   a randomly chosen sequence of operations, right?
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.520]   So we, you know, we, and sometimes, you know,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.740]   that part is almost trivial, right?
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.440]   We just sort of get the qubits to interact
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.640]   in some random way, although a sort of
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.760]   precisely specified random way,
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.200]   so we can repeat the exact same
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.600]   random sequence of interactions again
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.680]   and get another sample from that same distribution.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.020]   And what this does is it basically,
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.280]   well, it creates a lot of garbage,
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.720]   but, you know, very specific garbage, right?
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.280]   So, you know, of all of the,
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.520]   so if we're going to talk about Google's device,
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.200]   there were 53 qubits there, okay?
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.160]   And so there were two to the 53 power possible outputs.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.480]   Now, for some of those outputs, you know,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.380]   there was a little bit more destructive interference
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.800]   in their amplitude, okay?
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.180]   So their amplitudes were a little bit smaller.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.600]   And for others, there was a little more
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.360]   constructive interference.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.000]   You know, the amplitudes were a little bit
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.240]   more aligned with each other, you know,
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.980]   and so those that were a little bit likelier, okay?
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:42.320]   All of the outputs are exponentially unlikely,
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.520]   but some are, let's say, two times or three times,
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.840]   you know, unlikelier than others, okay?
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.880]   And so you can define, you know,
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.680]   this sequence of operations that gives rise
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.040]   to this probability distribution, okay?
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.560]   Now, the next question would be, well, how do you,
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.160]   you know, even if you're sampling from it,
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.400]   how do you verify that?
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.200]   - Right, exactly. - How do you know?
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   And so my students and I, and also the people at Google
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.160]   were doing the experiment, came up with statistical tests
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.000]   that you can apply to the outputs in order to
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.520]   try to verify, you know, what is, you know,
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.920]   that at least that some hard problem is being solved.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.760]   The test that Google ended up using
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.960]   was something that they called
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.960]   the linear cross-entropy benchmark, okay?
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.440]   And it's basically, you know, so the drawback of this test
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.400]   is that it requires, like, it requires you
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:43.200]   to do a two to the 53 time calculation
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.040]   with your classical computer, okay?
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.880]   So it's very expensive to do the test
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.380]   on a classical computer. - Yeah.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.880]   - The good news is-- - How big of a number
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.760]   is two to the 53? - It's about nine quadrillion.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.260]   - Okay. - That doesn't help.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.080]   - Well, you know, it's, you want it
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.480]   in like scientific notation?
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.400]   - No, no, no, what I mean is--
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.160]   - It is just-- - Is it impossible
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.400]   to run on a-- - Yeah, so we will come
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.620]   back to that, it is just barely possible to run,
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.480]   we think, on the largest supercomputer
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.200]   that currently exists on Earth,
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.680]   which is called Summit at Oak Ridge National Lab, okay?
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.000]   - Great, this is exciting.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.360]   - That's the short answer.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.080]   So ironically, for this type of experiment,
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.480]   we don't want 100 qubits, okay?
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.120]   Because with 100 qubits, even if it works,
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.720]   we don't know how to verify the results, okay?
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.840]   So we want a number of qubits that is enough
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.480]   that the biggest classical computers on Earth
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.640]   will have to sweat, and will just barely be able
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.240]   to keep up with the quantum computer,
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.920]   using much more time, but they will still be able
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.400]   to do it in order that we can verify the result.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.280]   - Which is where the 53 comes from,
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.360]   for the number of qubits? - Basically, well,
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.280]   I mean, that's also, that's sort of,
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:59.000]   I mean, that's sort of where they are now,
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.880]   in terms of scaling, and then soon,
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.040]   that point will be passed, and then when you get
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.920]   to larger numbers of qubits, then these types
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.280]   of sampling experiments will no longer be so interesting,
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.060]   because we won't even be able to verify the results,
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.880]   and we'll have to switch to other types of computation.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   So with the sampling thing, so the test that Google applied,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.840]   this linear cross-entropy benchmark,
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.520]   was basically just take the samples that were generated,
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.360]   which are a very small subset of all the possible samples
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.200]   that there are, but for those, you calculate,
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.800]   with your classical computer, the probabilities
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.680]   that they should have been output,
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.440]   and you see, are those probabilities larger than the mean?
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:46.680]   So is the quantum computer biased toward outputting
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.440]   the strings that you want it to be biased toward?
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.400]   Okay, and then, finally, we come to a very crucial question,
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.360]   which is supposing that it does that,
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.560]   well, how do we know that a classical computer
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.400]   could not have quickly done the same thing?
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.800]   How do we know that this couldn't have been spoofed
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.640]   by a classical computer?
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.960]   And so, well, the first answer is we don't know, for sure,
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.620]   because this takes us into questions of complexity theory,
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.880]   I mean, questions of the magnitude
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.760]   of the P versus NP question, and things like that, right?
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.640]   We don't know how to rule out definitively
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.680]   that there could be fast classical algorithms
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.080]   for even simulating quantum mechanics,
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.460]   and for simulating experiments like these,
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.280]   but we can give some evidence against that possibility,
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.280]   and that was sort of the main thrust of a lot of the work
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.840]   that my colleagues and I did over the last decade,
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.880]   which is then sort of in around 2015 or so,
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.040]   what led to Google deciding to do this experiment.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.200]   - So is the kind of evidence you, first of all,
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.960]   the hard P equals NP problem that you mentioned,
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.920]   and the kind of evidence that you were looking at,
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.880]   is that something you come to on a sheet of paper,
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.480]   or is this something, are these empirical experiments?
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.640]   - It's math, for the most part.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.640]   I mean, it's also, we have a bunch of methods
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.160]   that are known for simulating quantum circuits,
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.640]   or quantum computations with classical computers,
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.420]   and so we have to try them all out,
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:28.160]   and make sure that they don't work,
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.360]   make sure that they have exponential scaling
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.280]   on these problems, and not just theoretically,
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.460]   but with the actual range of parameters
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:40.420]   that are actually arising in Google's experiment.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.480]   Okay, so there is an empirical component to it, right?
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.760]   But now, on the theoretical side,
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.840]   basically what we know how to do
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.760]   in theoretical computer science,
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.640]   and computational complexity,
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.240]   is we don't know how to prove
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.960]   that most of the problems we care about are hard,
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.920]   but we know how to pass the blame to someone else.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.120]   Okay, we know how to say, well, look,
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.480]   I can't prove that this problem is hard,
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.040]   but if it is easy, then all these other things
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.200]   that you probably were much more confident,
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.880]   or were hard, then those would be easy as well, okay?
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.840]   So we can give what are called reductions.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.400]   This has been the basic strategy in NP completeness,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.580]   right, in all of theoretical computer science,
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:31.120]   and cryptography since the 1970s, really.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.320]   And so we were able to give some reduction evidence
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   for the hardness of simulating these sampling experiments,
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.340]   these sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.280]   The reduction evidence is not as satisfactory
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.440]   as it should be.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.040]   One of the biggest open problems in this area
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.560]   is to make it better.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.680]   But we can do something.
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.560]   Certainly we can say that if there is
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.280]   a fast classical algorithm to spoof these experiments,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.280]   then it has to be very, very unlike
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.040]   any of the algorithms that we know.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.320]   - Which is kind of in the same kind of space of reasoning
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.280]   that people say P not equals NP.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.560]   - Yeah, it's in the same spirit.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.840]   - Yeah, in the same spirit.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.840]   Okay, so Andrew Yang, a very intelligent
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.520]   and presidential candidate with a lot of interesting ideas
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.760]   in all kinds of technological fields,
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.440]   tweeted that because of quantum computing,
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.180]   no code is uncrackable.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:38.480]   Is he wrong or right?
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.920]   - He was premature, let's say.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.840]   So, well, okay, wrong.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.160]   (both laughing)
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.720]   Look, I'm actually, I'm a fan of Andrew Yang.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.120]   I like his ideas, I like his candidacy.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:58.360]   I think that he may be ahead of his time
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.880]   with the universal basic income and so forth,
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.000]   and he may also be ahead of his time
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.080]   in that tweet that you referenced.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.560]   So, regarding using quantum computers
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:13.360]   to break cryptography, so the situation is this.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.600]   So, the famous discovery of Peter Shor,
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.480]   26 years ago, that really started quantum computing
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.440]   as an autonomous field was that if you built
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.280]   a full scalable quantum computer,
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.600]   then you could use it to efficiently find the prime factors
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.600]   of huge numbers and calculate discrete logarithms
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.600]   and solve a few other problems
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.040]   that are very, very special in character, right?
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.960]   They're not NP-complete problems.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.560]   We're pretty sure they're not, okay?
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.560]   But it so happens that most of the public key cryptography
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.520]   that we currently use to protect the internet
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:58.000]   is based on the belief that these problems are hard.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.080]   What Shor showed is that once you get
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.440]   scalable quantum computers, then that's no longer true.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.040]   But now, before people panic,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.960]   there are two important points to understand here.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.320]   Okay, the first is that quantum supremacy,
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.840]   the milestone that Google just achieved,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   is very, very far from the kind of scalable quantum computer
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.480]   that would be needed to actually
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.760]   threaten public key cryptography.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.920]   Okay, so we touched on this earlier, right?
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.920]   But Google's device has 53 physical qubits, right?
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.800]   To threaten cryptography, you're talking,
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.160]   you know, with any of the known error correction methods,
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.560]   you're talking millions of physical qubits.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.880]   - 'Cause error correction would be required
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.560]   to threaten cryptography. - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.960]   Yes, it certainly would, right?
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.920]   And, you know, how much, you know,
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.960]   how great will the overhead be from the error correction?
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.320]   That we don't know yet.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.960]   But with the known codes, you're talking millions
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.720]   of physical qubits and of a much higher quality
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.000]   than any that we have now.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.040]   Okay, so, you know, I don't think that that is,
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.800]   you know, coming soon.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.120]   Although people who have secrets that, you know,
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.880]   need to stay secret for 20 years, you know,
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.160]   are already worried about this, you know,
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.040]   for the good reason that, you know,
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.760]   we presume that intelligence agencies
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.360]   are already scooping up data, you know,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.200]   in the hope that eventually they'll be able to decode it
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.880]   once quantum computers become available, okay?
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.720]   So this brings me to the second point I wanted to make,
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.560]   which is that there are other public key cryptosystems
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.400]   that are known that we don't know how to break
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.640]   even with quantum computers, okay?
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.640]   And so there's a whole field devoted to this now,
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.800]   which is called post-quantum cryptography, okay?
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.480]   And so there is already,
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.480]   so we have some good candidates now.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.560]   The best known being what are called
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.920]   lattice-based cryptosystems.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.760]   And there is already some push to try to migrate
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.960]   to these cryptosystems.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   So NIST in the US is holding a competition
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:14.160]   to create standards for post-quantum cryptography,
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.600]   which will be the first step in trying to get
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.000]   every web browser and every router to upgrade, you know,
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.880]   and use, you know, something like SSL
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.440]   that would be based on, you know,
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   what we think is quantum secure cryptography.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.140]   But, you know, this will be a long process,
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.320]   but, you know, it is something that people
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.840]   are already starting to do.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.400]   And so, you know, I'm sure his algorithm
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.000]   is sort of a dramatic discovery.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.440]   You know, it could be a big deal
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.120]   for whatever intelligence agency first gets
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.960]   a scalable quantum computer,
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.680]   if no, at least certainly if no one else knows
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.720]   that they have it, right?
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.560]   But eventually we think that we could migrate the internet
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.600]   to the post-quantum cryptography,
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.540]   and then we'd be more or less back where we started.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.300]   Okay, so this is sort of not the application
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.680]   of quantum computing, I think,
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.560]   that's really going to change the world
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.080]   in a sustainable way, right?
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.380]   The big, by the way, the biggest practical application
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.520]   of quantum computing that we know about by far,
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.640]   I think is simply the simulation
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.520]   of quantum mechanics itself.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.000]   In order to, you know, learn about chemical reactions,
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.480]   you know, design maybe new chemical processes,
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.920]   new materials, new drugs, new solar cells,
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:35.880]   new superconductors, all kinds of things like that.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.800]   - What's the size of a quantum computer
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.280]   that would be able to simulate the, you know,
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.840]   quantum mechanical systems themselves
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.960]   that would be impactful for the real world
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.520]   for the kind of chemical reactions and that kind of work?
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.240]   What scale are we talking about?
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.020]   - Now you're asking a very, very current question,
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.920]   a very big question.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.100]   People are going to be racing over the next decade
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.900]   to try to do useful quantum simulations,
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:09.280]   even with, you know, 100 or 200 qubit quantum computers
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.640]   of the sort that we expect to be able to build
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.280]   over the next decade, okay?
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.560]   So that might be, you know, the first application
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.280]   of quantum computing that we're able to realize,
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.280]   you know, or maybe it will prove to be too difficult
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.260]   and maybe even that will require fault tolerance
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.480]   or, you know, will require error correction.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.580]   - So there's an aggressive race to come up
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:34.220]   with the one case study, kind of like with Peter Shor,
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.380]   with the idea that would just capture
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.220]   the world's imagination of, look,
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.940]   we can actually do something very useful here.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.340]   - Right, but I think, you know, within the next decade,
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:47.380]   the best shot we have is certainly not, you know,
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:51.540]   using Shor's algorithm to break cryptography, you know,
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.540]   just because it requires, you know,
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.880]   too much in the way of error correction.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.020]   The best shot we have is to do some quantum simulation
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.820]   that tells the material scientists or chemists
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.920]   or nuclear physicists, you know,
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.580]   something that is useful to them
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.180]   and that they didn't already know.
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:11.780]   You know, and you might only need one or two successes
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.080]   in order to change some, you know,
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.780]   billion dollar industries, right?
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.580]   Like, you know, the way that people make fertilizer
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.860]   right now is still based on the Haber-Bosch process
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:24.300]   from a century ago, and it is some many-body
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:27.080]   quantum mechanics problem that no one really understands.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.640]   Right, if you could design a better way to make fertilizer,
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.240]   right, that's, you know, billions of dollars right there.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.160]   So those are sort of the applications
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.760]   that people are going to be aggressively racing toward
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.220]   over the next decade.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.640]   Now, I don't know if they're gonna realize it or not,
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.360]   but, you know, they certainly at least have a shot.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.120]   So it's gonna be a very, very interesting next decade.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.640]   - But just to clarify, what's your intuition
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.140]   is if a breakthrough like that comes,
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.480]   is it possible for that breakthrough
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.320]   to be on 50 to 100 qubits,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.200]   or is scale a fundamental thing,
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.320]   like 500, 1,000 plus qubits?
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.480]   - Yeah, so I can tell you what the current studies
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:11.360]   are saying, you know, I think probably better
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.080]   to rely on that than on my intuition.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.600]   But, you know, there was a group at Microsoft
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.920]   had a study a few years ago that said,
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.840]   even with only about 100 qubits,
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.180]   you know, you could already learn something new
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:30.020]   about the chemical reaction that makes fertilizer,
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:30.960]   for example.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:34.580]   The trouble is they're talking about 100 qubits
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:39.020]   and about a million layers of quantum gates.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.860]   Okay, so basically they're talking about
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.100]   100 nearly perfect qubits.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.820]   - So the logical qubits as you mentioned before.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.580]   - Yeah, exactly, 100 logical qubits.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.840]   And now, you know, the hard part for the next decade
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.380]   is gonna be, well, what can we do
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:56.140]   with 100 to 200 noisy qubits?
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.140]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.220]   - Is there error correction breakthroughs
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.900]   that might come without the need to do
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.100]   thousands or millions of physical qubits?
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.980]   - Yeah, so people are gonna be pushing simultaneously
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.920]   on a bunch of different directions.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:13.080]   One direction, of course, is just making the qubits better.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.300]   Right?
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.100]   And, you know, there is tremendous progress there.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.420]   I mean, you know, the fidelity is like,
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.700]   the accuracy of the qubits has improved
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.700]   by several orders of magnitude, you know,
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:28.440]   in the last decade or two.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.780]   Okay, the second thing is designing better,
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:36.220]   you know, let's say lower overhead error correcting codes.
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:40.340]   And even short of doing the full recursive error correction,
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:43.480]   you know, there are these error mitigation strategies
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.060]   that you can use, you know, that may, you know,
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:52.060]   allow you to eke out a useful speed up in the near term.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.820]   And then the third thing is just taking
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.900]   the quantum algorithms for simulating quantum chemistry
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.940]   or materials and making them more efficient.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.060]   You know, and those algorithms are already
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:06.260]   dramatically more efficient than they were,
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.980]   let's say, five years ago.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.540]   And so when, you know, I quoted these estimates,
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:13.380]   like, you know, circuit depth of 1 million.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.820]   And so, you know, I hope that because people will care enough
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.900]   that these numbers are gonna come down.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:23.900]   - So you're one of the world-class researchers in this space.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.100]   There's a few groups, like you mentioned,
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.900]   Google and IBM working at this.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.980]   There's other research labs.
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:35.980]   But you put also, you have an amazing blog.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.660]   You just, you put a lot of-- - You're too kind.
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:40.260]   - You put a, you paid me to say it.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:44.220]   You put a lot of efforts sort of to communicating
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.980]   the science of this and communicating,
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:52.220]   exposing some of the BS and sort of the natural,
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.820]   just like in the AI space, the natural charlatanism,
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.060]   if that's a word, in this, in quantum mechanics in general,
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.020]   but quantum computers and so on.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:08.020]   Can you give some notes about people or ideas
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.380]   that people like me or listeners in general
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.700]   from outside the field should be cautious of
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.980]   when they're taking in news headings
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.460]   that Google achieved quantum supremacy?
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.540]   So what should we look out for?
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.180]   Where's the charlatans in this space?
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:24.020]   Where's the BS?
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:26.980]   - Yeah, so, good question.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:31.660]   Unfortunately, quantum computing is a little bit like
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.180]   cryptocurrency or deep learning.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.780]   Like there is a core of something
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.860]   that is genuinely revolutionary and exciting.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.500]   And because of that core, it attracts
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.700]   this sort of vast penumbra of people making
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.980]   just utterly ridiculous claims.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.340]   And so with quantum computing, I mean,
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:56.420]   I would say that the main way that people go astray
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:00.860]   is by not focusing on sort of the question of,
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:02.300]   are you getting a speed up
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:05.140]   over a classical computer or not, right?
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:10.140]   And so people have like dismissed quantum supremacy
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.300]   because it's not useful, right?
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:16.380]   Or it's not itself, let's say, obviously useful for anything.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.980]   Okay, but ironically, these are some of the same people
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.260]   who will go and say, well,
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:23.500]   we care about useful applications.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.260]   We care about solving traffic routing
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.940]   and financial optimization and all these things.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.140]   And that sounds really good,
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:36.900]   but their entire spiel is sort of counting on
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:39.060]   nobody asking the question, yes,
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:42.340]   but how well could a classical computer do the same thing?
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:43.940]   - Yes. - Right?
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.420]   I really mean the entire thing is,
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.540]   they say, well, a quantum computer can do this,
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.300]   a quantum computer can do that, right?
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.060]   And they just avoid the question,
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:58.660]   are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.220]   And if so, how do you know?
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:05.260]   Have you really thought carefully about classical algorithms
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:07.740]   to solve the same problem, right?
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.100]   And a lot of the application areas
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:15.100]   that companies and investors are most excited about,
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.780]   that the popular press is most excited about
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:22.180]   for quantum computers have been things like
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:27.180]   machine learning, AI, optimization, okay?
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:31.780]   And the problem with that is that since the very beginning,
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:36.700]   even if you have a perfect fault tolerant,
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.500]   scalable quantum computer,
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:43.060]   we have known of only modest speed ups
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:46.380]   that you can get for these problems, okay?
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.740]   So there is a famous quantum algorithm
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.860]   called Grover's algorithm, okay?
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:54.460]   And what it can do is it can solve many, many of the problems
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:58.180]   that arise in AI, machine learning, optimization,
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.780]   including NP complete problems, okay?
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.540]   But it can solve them in about the square root
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.980]   of the number of steps that a classical computer
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.260]   would need for the same problems, okay?
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:12.340]   Now a square root speed up is important, it's impressive.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.140]   It is not an exponential speed up, okay?
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:17.780]   So it is not the kind of game changer
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.820]   that let's say Shor's algorithm for factoring is,
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:23.700]   or for that matter, that simulation of quantum mechanics is,
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:26.300]   okay, it is a more modest speed up.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.780]   Let's say roughly, in theory,
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.380]   it could roughly double the size
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.380]   of the optimization problems that you could handle, right?
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:38.380]   And so, because people found that, I guess, too boring
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:43.980]   or too unimpressive, they've gone on to invent
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.100]   all of these heuristic algorithms where,
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.380]   because no one really understands them,
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:52.500]   you can just project your hopes onto them, right?
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.820]   That well, maybe it gets an exponential speed up.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.740]   You can't prove that it doesn't,
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.300]   and the burden is on you to prove
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:00.860]   that it doesn't get a speed up, right?
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.220]   And so they've done an immense amount
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:07.140]   of that kind of thing, and a really worrying amount
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:09.780]   of the case for building a quantum computer
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:11.780]   has come to rest on this stuff
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.860]   that those of us in this field know perfectly well
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.620]   is on extremely shaky foundations.
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:20.620]   - So the fundamental question is,
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:23.540]   show that there's a speed up over the classical.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.380]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.500]   - And in this space that you're referring to,
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:27.660]   which is actually really interesting,
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.100]   is the area that a lot of people are excited about
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.340]   is machine learning.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:34.700]   So your sense is, do you think it will,
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:37.780]   I know that there's a lot of smoke currently,
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:40.300]   but do you think there actually eventually
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:43.700]   might be breakthroughs where you do get exponential
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.580]   speed ups in the machine learning space?
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.020]   - Absolutely, there might be.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.660]   I mean, I think we know of modest speed ups
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:52.700]   that you can get for these problems.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.500]   I think whether you can get bigger speed ups
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.100]   is one of the biggest questions
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.620]   for quantum computing theory.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:03.580]   For people like me to be thinking about.
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:07.460]   Now, we had actually recently a really,
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:12.340]   a super exciting candidate for an exponential
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.180]   quantum speed up for a machine learning problem
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.780]   that people really care about.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.100]   This is basically the Netflix problem.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:22.380]   The problem of recommending products to users
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.540]   given some sparse data about their preferences.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:29.500]   Karunidas and Prakash in 2016 had an algorithm
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:33.660]   for sampling recommendations that was exponentially faster
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:35.900]   than any known classical algorithm.
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:38.020]   And so a lot of people were excited.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:40.140]   I was excited about it.
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:44.540]   I had an 18 year old undergrad by the name of Yilin Tang.
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:47.180]   And she was obviously brilliant.
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.820]   She was looking for a project.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.380]   I gave her as a project,
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:52.900]   can you prove that this speed up is real?
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.620]   Can you prove that any classical algorithm
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:58.900]   would need to access exponentially more data?
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.740]   And this was a case where if that was true,
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:05.100]   this was not like a P versus NP type of question.
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:07.180]   This might well have been provable.
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:09.180]   But she worked on it for a year.
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.620]   She couldn't do it.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.460]   Eventually she figured out why she couldn't do it.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:15.540]   And the reason was that that was false.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:18.220]   There is a classical algorithm
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:20.900]   with a similar performance to the quantum algorithm.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.940]   So Yilin succeeded in de-quantizing
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.380]   that machine learning algorithm.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.020]   And then in the last couple of years,
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.260]   building on Yilin's breakthrough,
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:33.100]   a bunch of the other quantum machine learning algorithms
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:36.580]   that were proposed have now also been de-quantized.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.420]   Okay, and so I would say--
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.180]   - That's a kind of important backward step.
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:41.020]   - Yes.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:43.700]   - Or a forward step for science,
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:47.020]   but a step for quantum machine learning
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.860]   that precedes the big next forward step.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.700]   - Right, right, right.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:52.540]   - If it's possible.
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:54.380]   - Right, now some people will say,
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.100]   well, you know, there's a silver lining in this cloud.
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.340]   They say, well, thinking about quantum computing
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.100]   has led to the discovery
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.940]   of potentially useful new classical algorithms.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:04.780]   - That's true.
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:07.540]   - Right, and so you get these spinoff applications,
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:09.380]   but if you want a quantum speedup,
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.940]   you really have to think carefully about that.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.340]   You know, Yilin's work was a perfect illustration of why.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.980]   Right, and I think that the challenge,
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.460]   the field is now open, right?
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.900]   Find a better example.
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:27.020]   Find where quantum computers are going
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.420]   to deliver big gains for machine learning.
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:36.100]   Not only do I ardently support people thinking about that,
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.780]   I'm trying to think about it myself
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.740]   and have my students and postdocs think about it,
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.100]   but we should not pretend
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:45.540]   that those speedups are already established,
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:49.460]   and the problem comes when so many of the companies
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:53.660]   and journalists in this space are pretending that.
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:57.900]   - Like all good things, like life itself,
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.700]   this conversation must soon come to an end.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:04.780]   Let me ask the most absurdly philosophical last question.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.660]   What is the meaning of life?
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:11.700]   What gives your life fulfillment, purpose,
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:15.660]   happiness, and yeah, meaning?
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:19.060]   - I would say, you know, number one,
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:22.580]   trying to discover new things about the world
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.500]   and share them and communicate
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.540]   and learn what other people have discovered.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:34.540]   You know, number two, my friends, my family,
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:39.060]   my kids, my students,
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:42.980]   you know, just the people around me.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:47.780]   Number three, you know, trying when I can
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.260]   to make the world better in some small ways.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:54.660]   And you know, it's depressing that I can't do more
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:59.660]   and that, you know, the world is facing crises
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:02.460]   over the climate and over, you know,
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.620]   sort of resurgent authoritarianism
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:05.700]   and all these other things,
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:10.700]   but you know, trying to stand against the things
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:12.540]   that I find horrible when I can.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:16.260]   - Let me ask you one more absurd question.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.540]   What makes you smile?
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.540]   - Well, yeah, I guess your question just did, I don't know.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.700]   (both laughing)
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:25.740]   - I thought I tried that absurd one on you.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.580]   Well, it was a huge honor to talk to you.
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:30.740]   We'll probably talk to you for many more hours, Scott.
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.660]   Thank you so much.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.500]   - Well, thank you, thank you, it was great.

[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:03.860]   Now, let me leave you with some words
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:07.300]   from a funny and insightful blog post Scott wrote
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:10.980]   over 10 years ago on the ever-present Malthusianisms
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:12.980]   in our daily lives.
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.860]   Quote, "Again and again,
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:17.060]   I've undergone the humbling experience
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.780]   of first lamenting how badly something sucks,
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.500]   then only much later having the crucial insight
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.180]   that it's not sucking
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:28.100]   wouldn't have been a Nash equilibrium."
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:32.380]   Thank you for listening, I hope to see you next time.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:37.580]   (upbeat music)
