[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   How will I find my ministry calling?
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.040]   Will I find it internally, like some impulse
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.280]   that will lead me to start a new thing,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.240]   or will my ministry calling come from the outside?
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720]   Will it come from others telling me where I'm needed?
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.720]   This is a great question, and it comes in today
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.840]   from a listener named Caleb.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.880]   Caleb references a conference that you preached at
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.960]   years back, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.680]   Here's his email.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.620]   Hello, Pastor John, at a conference now many years ago,
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.160]   you went to Colossians 4.17 to argue that God
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.440]   gives ministries to his children.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.960]   We don't stumble upon our ministry.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.100]   Instead, he decisively throws us into them, so to speak.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.680]   Any chance you'd be willing to explain on how this works
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.520]   and how it has worked for you in church
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.680]   and para-church context?
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.440]   Thank you, Pastor John, what would you say to Caleb?
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.400]   First, let me share several passages of scripture
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   that caused me to say that we are not the decisive cause
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.340]   of being in any particular ministry.
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.580]   God is.
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.580]   And then I'll step back and ask how that divine work
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.060]   is experienced in our minds and in our hearts
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.860]   so that we can make it more practical for people
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.300]   as they find their way into ministry in church
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.480]   or para-church.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.160]   Number one, Paul says to the elders who were gathered
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   in Acts 20.28, "Pay careful attention to yourselves
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.400]   "and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.360]   "has made you overseers."
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.320]   Literally set you or put you, ethetah in Greek.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.280]   Put you as overseers to care for the church of God
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.840]   which he obtained with his own blood.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.040]   God put those elders there as elders.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.240]   They did not put themselves there.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.380]   God did decisively.
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.520]   Number two, Ephesians 4, 11 and 12.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   Paul says, "Christ gave, gave to the church,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.460]   "the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists,
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.060]   "the pastors and teachers to equip the saints
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.600]   "for the work of the ministry,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.480]   "for building up the body of Christ."
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.120]   These ministers of the church are the gift
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.760]   of the risen Christ to his body.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.600]   They're there.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.760]   They are where they are as a gift of Christ.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.060]   Three, Matthew 9.37 and 38.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.680]   Jesus says, "The harvest is plentiful.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.180]   "The laborers are few.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.120]   "Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.560]   "to send out."
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.880]   The word is ekballo, throw out.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's where he got the word throw.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.280]   Toss them into ministry.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160]   He threw them into ministry.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.960]   Send out, throw the laborers into the harvest.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.480]   So when the Lord answers this prayer,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.400]   he does the decisive work and makes sure
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.360]   that the workers are where he wants them to be.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.280]   Number four, Romans 10, 13.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.140]   "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved,
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.780]   "but how are they to call on him whom they've not believed?
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.300]   "And how are they to believe in him
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.560]   "whom they have never heard?
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.920]   "And how are they to hear without someone preaching?
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   "And how are they to preach unless they are sent?"
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.080]   As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.620]   "of those who preach good news."
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.760]   Now, it's possible for a rogue preacher
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.420]   to preach without being sent by a church or a mission agency.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.560]   I don't think that's what Paul's talking about here.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   I think Paul is saying nobody can preach authentically.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Nobody can preach with integrity for God,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.820]   with God's authority, unless he is sent by God.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.500]   If anyone is preaching the gospel the way he ought,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.680]   as a faithful spokesman of God,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.760]   he has been sent by God, not by himself.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.140]   God is the decisive actor in putting them
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.100]   in that gospel preaching ministry.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.880]   Number five, Luke 12, 41.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.160]   Jesus had just told a parable about being ready
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.920]   for the second coming, and Peter says,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.440]   And Jesus answers like this,
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.320]   "Who then is the faithful and wise manager
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.320]   "whom his master will set," or appoint,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.140]   "over his household to give them their portion of food
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.320]   "at the proper time?"
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.120]   So when Jesus thinks of pastors and teachers,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.880]   of his people, he thinks of them as stewards
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.400]   put over a household.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.780]   He has appointed them.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.080]   They are not there randomly.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.080]   He has set them there, and they are to feed
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.880]   and take care of his house.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.620]   Number six, and this is the last of the six
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.280]   that I'm gonna mention.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.800]   There's the text that Caleb referred to,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.960]   namely Colossians 4, 17.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.500]   "Say to Archippus, 'See that you fulfill the ministry
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.400]   "'that you received in the Lord.'"
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.160]   So Archippus did not put himself in his ministry.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.900]   He received the ministry from the Lord.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.980]   Now, those six passages are the reason
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.080]   that Caleb is right when he quotes me as saying,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.760]   "We don't stumble upon our ministry.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   "Instead, God decisively throws us into them."
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.520]   But now in practice, in the church,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.720]   in parachurch ministries, wherever,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.760]   we have to ask the question,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   how does God work inside of us, inside of people,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.400]   their mind and their heart,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   so that they find themselves in the ministry
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.600]   where he's putting them?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.760]   What's the conscious experience of God's work,
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.640]   of guidance, of leading,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.800]   in getting us to where he wants us to be?
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.880]   And I'll mention just four things briefly
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.520]   that are typically the way God does it.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.640]   And I say typically because he's God
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.440]   and he can make exceptions to these.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.440]   First, there is ordinarily the rising in our hearts
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.000]   of a relentless and abiding desire for the work.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.960]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 3, 1,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.520]   "If anyone aspires to the office of overseer,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.600]   "he desires a noble task."
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.640]   That certainly was true for me.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.000]   Wow.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   In the two stages of my calling into the ministry,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.440]   God exploded in the fall of 1966,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.800]   when I was 20 years old,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.280]   with a relentless and abiding desire
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.760]   for the ministry of the word.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.240]   And then he did the same thing in 1979,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.680]   the fall of '79,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.000]   with a relentless and abiding desire
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.800]   for the proclamation of the word in the pastoral role.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.960]   These desires were not flashes in the pan.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.040]   They were deep and unshakable
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.880]   and they overcame significant obstacles.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.640]   Second, there is ordinarily a God-given fitness
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.880]   or giftedness for the ministry,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.880]   which is shown both in a cluster of abilities that we have
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:49.060]   and in the fruit of people actually being helped spiritually
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.040]   by the use of those abilities.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.400]   And all of that confirmed,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.360]   not just by our own individual selves,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.560]   but rather by the community of believers
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.360]   and especially the most mature and discerning believers.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.840]   Paul didn't just say to the elder,
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.320]   "If you desire it, you've got it."
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.120]   He gave a long list of qualifications.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   My goodness.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.840]   So the person moves into a ministry role,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.760]   one, because of a perceived set of abilities
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.240]   and some manifest fruit in people
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.160]   that are really being spiritually helped by those abilities.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.120]   And then third, through the mature brothers and sisters
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.120]   recognizing and confirming that fruit and giftedness.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.680]   Third, there's often a specific encouragement
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.000]   from other people that you should do
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.640]   this particular ministry.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.840]   Paul said to Timothy, "I want you to go with me."
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.440]   And that was pretty, that's pretty direct.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.480]   This happens very often.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.960]   Someone says to another person,
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.920]   "I really think you should do this."
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.680]   And it proves to be a kind of providence from the Lord,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.660]   a kind of encouragement that gets them
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.020]   over the hump of hesitation.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.060]   And then finally, number four,
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.060]   there's a correlation between our most consecrated,
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.780]   spiritually intense, holy submitted moments
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.820]   on the one hand, and the sense of God's favor and guidance
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.300]   for the ministry in those very moments on the other hand.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.020]   In other words, when we feel most confident
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.580]   in God's favor and guidance,
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.280]   those are the moments when we are least worldly,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.660]   least unspiritual, least indifferent.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.220]   There's a correlation between those seasons of life
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   when God seems to blow the cobwebs of worldliness
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.500]   and selfishness and greed and pride out of our hearts.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.460]   And it's in those moments when we sense the leading
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.260]   toward this ministry most keenly and surely.
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.960]   God confirms them, not in the carnal, selfish moments,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.800]   but in the humble, brokenhearted,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.360]   sacrificial, loving moments.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.080]   So in summary then, there are practical, relational,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   subjective experiences that move us toward ministry.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.360]   But in the end, it is the hidden hand
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   of God's gracious providence
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   that puts us, throws us where he wants us to be.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.480]   - Throws us where he wants us to be, that's good.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.660]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.360]   And speaking of calling and discerning that calling,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.380]   there are two other really helpful episodes in the archive.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.860]   How Do I Know God's Calling for My Life?
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.700]   That's APJ 744.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.400]   And I'm Not Good at My Job, Is the Lord Telling Me to Quit?
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.580]   That's APJ 1405.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.020]   Both go into more detail on calling.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.260]   You can find them, APJ 744 and 1405 in the archive.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.260]   You can find that archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.540]   Well, we live in an age of hate.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.420]   One political party hates the other political party.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.340]   One nation hates another nation.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.140]   And we as Christians are ever tempted
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.300]   to fall in line with the world,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.180]   tempted to hate our human opponents.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.900]   But oh, what a very different calling God gives his church.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.820]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke,
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.460]   and we will see you back here on Wednesday
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.640]   for that calling as we press into it
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.660]   and what it looks like today.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.500]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.220]   with longtime author and pastor, John Piper.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.420]   We'll see you Wednesday.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:07.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
