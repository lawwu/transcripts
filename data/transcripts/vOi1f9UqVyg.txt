[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   Whenever people say I'm thinking about starting a company, my
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.480]   first response is no, don't you have to be told over and over
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.720]   again to not start a company to test if they actually have the
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.960]   resilience and grit necessary just to take the first step of
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.200]   starting the company. This notion that everyone should be
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.920]   encouraged to start a company and entrepreneurism is a career

[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.840]   There's a reason a lot of people that have had success in their
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.120]   career don't end up being great entrepreneurs. Because as soon
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.440]   as you're faced with failure for the first time, it doesn't
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.240]   pattern match to what's happened to you historically, you have to
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.320]   really find ways to sacrifice. I think it's a requisite to
