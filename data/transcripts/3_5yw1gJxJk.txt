[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   It's Cal Newport here. This is my weekly update video
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.660]   where I bring you up to speed on my own struggles as a professional writer, professor, and
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.860]   podcaster to work deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:34.020]   Now the plan for this week is I want to talk about the books I read in the month of October.
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.940]   I normally do this on my podcast.
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.700]   Usually the first podcast episode of each month I talk about what I read the month before.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.960]   This time I forgot. So I figured okay, we'll use the weekly update video to get into these books and as a
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.620]   silver lining because we're filming this instead of just recording audio, I can show you some of the markings
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.620]   I use in my books. I can give you a
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.100]   in-person preview or review I should say of my note-taking system in my books. So let's get into it.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.340]   I'm dividing the books I read this last month I should say into two piles. One pile is
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.900]   what I'm thinking of as craft building books.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.900]   I selected these specifically as part of just an ongoing effort to be a better nonfiction writer.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.100]   This pile is more functional books. They had information I needed
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.380]   for stuff I'm working on. In this case, they are both relevant to the book on slow productivity that I'm writing.
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.340]   So let's start with the craft pile over here.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.940]   I thought it would be interesting to take a common topic and then get two different
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.300]   Pulitzer Prize winning books on that topic.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.260]   So I'm using the Pulitzer Prize as a proxy for these are really well-written books
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.980]   and I wanted to have two different books on the same topic as just an exercise of looking at the
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.260]   different ways available to tackling
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.980]   nonfiction writing. So I chose nature as my topic and chose these two Pulitzer Prize winners separated by over 40 years.
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.820]   Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek and Elizabeth Colbert's The Sixth Extinction.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.380]   So we'll start with Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. This was written in the
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.620]   1970s. It is a first-person account of a year that Annie Dillard spent living at a small
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.860]   cabin. This was in Virginia
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.660]   near a creek named Tinker Creek.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.140]   One thing I did here is I wanted a old copy of this book because this came out in the 70s.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.380]   I wanted one of these classic Bantam
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.580]   1970s paperbacks. So I bought this from a used bookstore. Still has the old owner's name in it. So this is a
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.220]   1975 edition. It's the fifth printing of the Bantam paperback. For whatever reason, I thought I would just
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.500]   be more of the spirit of the book to have an old version.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.220]   Here's what's interesting. I had a hard time getting into this.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.700]   It starts off with a lot of a little bit over-the-top
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.380]   metaphysical fluff.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.620]   I'll read you a line from this. "I'm no scientist.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.100]   I explore the neighborhood. An infant who has just learned to hold his head up has a frank and forthright way of gazing about him in
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.980]   bewilderment. He has the faintest clue where he is and he aims to learn. In a couple of years,
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.900]   what we will have learned instead is how to fake it. He'll have the cocksure air of a squatter who has come to feel his
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.540]   own place." A lot of thinking like that. There's a whole bunch of early on
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.580]   metaphysics about the universe and their place in it. Once she gets going though, it gets more readable.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.540]   It's a Pulitzer caliber observational writing about the different seasons in this one place.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.020]   It basically reminded me of Thoreau's Walden, but if you stripped away all the more pragmatic
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.780]   philosophy, which I like out of Walden and just left the meditations on the ice at the pond, that's basically this book.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780]   But I learned something from it.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.300]   Then I jumped to Elizabeth Colbert's The Sixth Extinction.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.060]   All right, this is about
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.580]   man-made extinctions, the extinction crisis that's being caused by man-made topics. What I'm interested in though is less the topic and
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.900]   more the form.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.100]   So how did she write this in such a way that she won a Pulitzer Prize?
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.780]   And what I learned was there was a lot of mixing on the ground journalism
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.620]   with really solid science writing. That seemed to be the secret here.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.580]   So she would go to the research center in Chile where they're trying to save a
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.500]   particular breed of frog that was going extinct and from there
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:43.620]   diverge out to a well-written, lucid, New Yorker style science writing about the overall extinction issue with frogs.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.260]   She bounces back and forth between time.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.700]   So you'll get
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.100]   the discovery of
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.100]   dinosaur bones and how man first learned that huge species went extinct and something we didn't know was true and that you'll jump forward in
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.300]   time to things we're discovering today about climate change.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.300]   So I think really the impressive thing about this book is the science reporting.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.980]   The on-the-ground journalism, a lot of it felt unnecessary.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.300]   She would show up at a place,
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.540]   talk to a few people and then do really good science writing and I would almost feel bad for her that she had to fly
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.180]   all the way to Chile just to write two pages about what the tanks look like. But a good book,
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.500]   I see why it won the Pulitzer. Very different
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.340]   than what Annie's up to.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.900]   I also read John McPhee's
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.420]   "A Sense of Where You Are".
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:36.380]   Now this is based off of the very first nonfiction article he wrote for the New Yorker in the mid-1960s.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.780]   It's a profile of the then Princeton University
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.820]   basketball star Bill Bradley who then went on to be a Rhodes Scholar and then a senator from New Jersey.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.100]   McPhee lived near Princeton growing up, used to watch
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.700]   Bradley play
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.660]   basketball when he was at his heyday.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.100]   So he had a personal connection. His dad had a connection to the Princeton team and so he knew the team and he knew and
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.620]   watched the Bradley phenomenon a little bit later in his life. So he was writing about what he knew.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.140]   This takes that profile and expands it to book length. I just wanted to get a
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.100]   exposure to this McPhee style
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.300]   profile writing. I thought that might be useful craft for me to dissect and all I can say is
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.580]   McPhee knows what he's doing.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.420]   It's a quick read, it is a good profile.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.740]   It really kicks in that style of profile writing, that New Yorker style that McPhee is famous for where you can just
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.180]   tell he is drowning in information about this person and it's set piece followed by set piece followed by set piece
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.900]   connected by
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.260]   discursions or divergences throughout time and backstory and what he used to be like and what this is like and you come out of it
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.180]   really understanding the player.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.180]   Not surprisingly a good book.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.300]   All right, second pile. I have two books that were at least partially meant to be read for writing projects I'm working on.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.260]   This was a busy month. I mean, I typically have at least one or two fun books in my month.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.820]   I didn't actually finish a fun book in the month of October.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.860]   I did read 250 pages of Stephen King's new book Fairy Tale in honor of Halloween, but I lost steam on that.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.860]   So I don't have it here in my pile.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.300]   So let me talk first about
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.220]   Never Broken, the memoir of the musician Jewel.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.700]   I didn't intend to read this whole book.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:34.860]   I needed some details about Jewel's initial breakthrough in the music, which I had heard her talk about in an interview.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:42.220]   I needed details about that specific occurrence for use in the book I'm writing, but this was so fascinating I ended up reading the whole thing.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.540]   You don't know much about Jewel
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.620]   if you don't know much about Jewel. And what I mean about that is if all you know is her music,
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.540]   you will be shocked when you read a book like this. She comes out of a homestead in Alaska.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:02.340]   She was performing as a young girl in Inuit villages with her dad. She was yodeling.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.500]   It's a crazy backstory about how she ended up leaving Alaska,
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.020]   ending up as a breaking through as a musician at a time when she was homeless.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.820]   So it's a crazy story here.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.340]   So I didn't get it. I meant to read just one chapter, read the whole book.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.100]   Fascinating.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.100]   Final book of the month,
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.500]   Coppola
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   by Peter Cowie. It's a
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:31.700]   biography of Francis Ford Coppola, the movie director. This is not a particularly new book.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.300]   I think this is from, let me look it up here, I think the 90s.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.180]   1994, so it only captures him up through
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.820]   1994. It's a workman-like
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:48.140]   biography. It's one of the first to really capture. It's movie after movie, how that came together, what we know about it.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.420]   Okay, next movie. So it's one of these sort of secondary sources that's useful when you need research on a subject.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.380]   I initially was looking into this because I wanted some quotes about the movie brats.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:05.180]   So that first generation of directors that went to film school and took over Hollywood in the 70s.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:12.900]   Coppola was the, if you'll excuse the term, godfather of that group, but included Spielberg, it included Lucas, included Brian De Palma,
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.020]   included Martin Scorsese,
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.900]   included John Milius. The main thing I got out of this was
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.820]   what it was like to be a filmmaker, especially in the 70s. A really interesting time.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.820]   So I feel like I picked up some good tips out of that.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.620]   All right, what I want to show you briefly before we end today is how I take notes on books
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.180]   when I'm reading those books as research for a project I'm working on.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.420]   So I've talked about this in my podcast before, but I can show it to you in action.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.100]   My method is, if there's a page that has something
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.780]   important on it that I think I might need, I mark the corner.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.900]   That indicates that this page has
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.500]   content on it that's useful. And then I will use
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.540]   brackets or arrows or bullet points to pull out what are the actual sentences that I think are useful.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.540]   So here we can see,
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:11.860]   she said, "I was so proud when I moved into my little cabin." Why am I marking that? It's an important beat in her timeline.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:17.220]   Oh, she lives in a cabin now. Okay, if we're doing the timeline of her young adulthood, this would be an important beat.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.340]   Down here, she talked about working in town about 15 miles away. And this is an amazing thing.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.420]   She said, "I rode my horse two hours by beach to get to her job."
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.940]   That's a great tidbit, which I actually used in a draft of my book.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.820]   Flip to the next page. Okay, that's a marked page. There's two interesting things there.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.340]   I have an arrow, an arrow, some underline to point out what's important.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:44.420]   A bunch of pages won't be marked at all. Then I get to another page that's marked. Okay, bracket, checkmark.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.740]   This is how I mark up books.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.460]   Mark the corners or something on the page. Mark on the page what's important.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.100]   If I needed to go back and understand what happened in Jewel's life,
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.580]   let's say it's a year or two from now and I want to write about her,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.700]   all I would do is flip through this book looking for pages that are marked in the corner.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.100]   When I get to a page that's marked in the corner, only reading the lines that are marked.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.300]   It'll take me about five or ten minutes to do that for this book.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:19.060]   And I will have loaded back in 90% of what's probably useful out of this book for use in an article, for use in a book chapter.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:25.060]   So the key to that system for me is it's low friction. It doesn't slow down your writing. You mark, mark, mark.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.060]   You barely have to stop.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.980]   There's no pause from your chapter to go and put things on an index card or type them into a Zettelkasten system.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:38.340]   You're marking at the speed of writing and yet you can still very efficiently pull back out of that book
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.980]   what's important.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.940]   So you can tell if you look at my library which books I'm using for research and which books I'm just reading for my own purpose.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.140]   Coppola also has marks. I was doing this one with a pen.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.220]   But
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.600]   Annie Dillard does it because I was reading this for craft, not for information.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.980]   So that's what I read in October of 2022. That is how I mark up my books.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.200]   I'll be back next week with another weekly update.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   [Music]
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.700]   (upbeat music)
