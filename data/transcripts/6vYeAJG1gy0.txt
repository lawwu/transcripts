[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   People will talk about something for years. They will want something for years. They'll want it
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.140]   deep in their soul. And then when presented with the opportunity to get the very thing
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.900]   they have talked about, dreamed about, agonized about, they will become skeptical. I see it all
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.140]   the time. I have people in my community, they talk about starting a business. They've wanted
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.580]   to start a business for six years. They follow 13 people on social, three on newsletter, two on
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.800]   podcast. And they'll say, I don't have an idea. I don't have this. We have a program that does
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.180]   exactly that. And they'll get to the sales page. It has literally every single question they could
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.680]   ever conceivably come up with. And then suddenly they start going, will it do this? Will it help
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.260]   a left-handed person who lives south of the equator, but only between September and October?
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.740]   Even with me, when I first started trying to get fit, I had thought about it, talked about it,
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.320]   played around with weights. I didn't know what I was doing. Finally, when faced with the opportunity
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.900]   to actually get a personal trainer and learn how this worked, I started debating it. Oh,
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.960]   should I do this? Will it be hard? What about injuries? Blah, blah, blah. It's just a human
