[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   - Okay, mine is Psalms 37, four.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.960]   Delight thyself.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.800]   - Oh.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.080]   - I love the word delight, don't you?
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.920]   And I'm so--
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.120]   - Last fall, Oprah appeared on The Late Show
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.000]   with Stephen Colbert,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.320]   and they exchanged favorite Bible verses.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.960]   And Oprah chose Psalm 37, verse four,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.000]   prompting podcast listener, Gavin Thompson,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.920]   to write us this.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.480]   Hello, Pastor John, I'm a long-time listener,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.320]   and I've read many of your books, including Desiring God.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.920]   I know well that God is most glorified,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.320]   and us, when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.160]   I wanted to ask you about this interview in October,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.680]   where Oprah talks about Psalm 37, verse four,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.080]   and delighting in God.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.960]   I know her interpretation is not biblical,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.440]   but I was hoping you could teach us
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.320]   the true meaning of the verse.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.480]   When we delight ourselves in the Lord,
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.920]   what exactly does that mean?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.320]   - Well, I went and listened to the segment
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.040]   where she spoke on this,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.680]   and whenever I listen to Oprah,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.960]   which isn't very often,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.800]   I come away with amazement at how amazingly gifted she is.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   And I wish she would recover more of her gospel roots
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   and find her way back to the particularities
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.120]   of the Christian faith,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.280]   rather than distancing herself from them
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.120]   in order to pull all the religions into the same orbit,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.440]   which is what it seems to me she's regularly trying to do.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.920]   So Stephen Colbert asked her
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.880]   if she had a favorite Bible verse,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.040]   and she said, "Yes, Psalm 37, four.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620]   "Delight yourself in the Lord,
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.560]   "and He will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560]   So to get at the meaning,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.360]   let me describe four differences
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   between the way Oprah handled the verse
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.880]   and the way I handle the verse.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.700]   The first thing she did was to move
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.440]   from the specific person of Yahweh,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.400]   you know, whenever you see the all caps L-O-R-D
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.640]   in the English version,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.200]   that means it's a reference
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   to the particular personal name of the God of Israel,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.240]   not to a generic proper name
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.680]   or not to a generic name of God.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.360]   And that's what's here.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.160]   Delight yourself in Yahweh, the God of Israel,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.800]   the God and Father of the Messiah, Jesus Christ,
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.680]   who ascended into the world to die for sinners
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.640]   and rise again and establish an eternal kingdom.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.000]   That's the God that's being known and delighted in here.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.840]   But what Oprah does is to say that,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.740]   here's a direct quote,
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.880]   "Lord has a wide range,
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.840]   "compassion, love, forgiveness, kindness,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.100]   "so you delight yourself in those virtues
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.240]   "where the character of the Lord is revealed."
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.160]   So she's moving from specificity in a person
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.360]   to generic character traits
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.720]   that everybody can be happy about.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.000]   Now, my approach is to move in exactly
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.920]   the opposite direction when I read that verse
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.960]   or anywhere else in the Bible.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.440]   I think the emphasis here falls not on aspects
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.720]   of virtue or character,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.760]   but on the person of the Lord himself.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.840]   So my mind is always moving from the things we know
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.680]   about God toward the person of God himself.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.120]   So I'm always thinking that when God reveals
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.240]   a particular thing about himself,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.320]   he's helping me know him.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.520]   That's the point of saying things about himself
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.680]   or doing particular things in the world.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.400]   He's helping me know him, the true God, a person,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.000]   so that my delight can be in him
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.160]   and not in anything abstracted from him
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   that could somehow be united then to another religion.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.840]   So on this first point, our minds,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.960]   Oprah's mind and my mind,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.400]   are moving in two opposite directions as we read the text.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.280]   That's the first difference.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.600]   The second difference,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.280]   and it's the reason why the first one really matters,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   is because of what she does with her direction in this text.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.200]   She says that the point of the text is the principle,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   quote, "If you focus on being a force for good,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.360]   "then good will come," period.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.960]   Now, then she generalizes by saying this.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.240]   This is her real agenda.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.200]   She says, "That's the same as, one,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.800]   "the third law of motion, two, karma,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.320]   "three, the golden rule."
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.360]   And so you can see what moving away
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.200]   from the specificities of the name of the God of Israel
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.800]   to generalizations about compassion, love, forgiveness,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.340]   and kindness leads to.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.520]   It enables her to say what this text is really saying
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.080]   is really the same thing you find in high-level physics,
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.160]   Eastern religions, teachings of Jesus.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.760]   So by moving away from the specificity of Yahweh,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.200]   she's able to move toward the unification of all religions
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.960]   and all science as having the same basic message.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.120]   And of course, that's the opposite
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.720]   of what I think the Psalms are doing.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   I think the psalmist is intensifying
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.400]   the specificity of the unique name of God, namely Yahweh,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   and seeking to capture our affections, our delight,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.280]   for a very personal relationship
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.320]   to a specifically personal deity
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.520]   whose character is revealed in the way he works
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.840]   in history and in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.040]   That's the second difference.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.640]   The third difference is that Oprah does not connect
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.360]   this verse with Jesus Christ at all,
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.860]   except as Jesus lines up with the principles of physics
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.040]   and the Eastern religions.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.360]   And I would relate this to Jesus in another way.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.200]   I think delighting yourself in the Lord
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.000]   is another way of saying,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.040]   love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.920]   Jesus' words in Matthew 22, 36.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.780]   And then I would point out that Jesus taught
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.520]   that no one can truly love the Lord God.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.460]   No one can truly delight in the Lord God of Israel
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.200]   who does not receive Jesus himself as the Son of God
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.640]   and the Redeemer of the world,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.000]   sent into the world by Yahweh.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.320]   And the reason I say that is because Jesus says this,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.400]   I know, he says to the Jewish leaders,
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   I know that you do not have the love of God within you.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.160]   Now, how do I know that?
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.360]   Next verse, verse 43.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.440]   This is John 5, 42 and 43.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   I have come in my Father's name and you do not receive me.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.060]   So if you don't receive Jesus, you don't love God.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.900]   - Amen.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.720]   - That's what he's saying.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.620]   So receiving Jesus is, as he's presented,
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.540]   especially there in the Gospel of John
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.460]   and throughout that whole Gospel and the New Testament,
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.980]   receiving Jesus is the litmus test
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.900]   of whether anyone's claim to love God
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.500]   or delight in God is authentic.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.140]   Which means that Oprah's effort to make this text
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.420]   serve the unification of religions
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.260]   is the opposite of its biblical intent.
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.280]   And here's the last difference
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.980]   between her way of going at this text
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.580]   and my way of going at this text.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.800]   Her way of handling the relationship
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.540]   between the two halves of the verse
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.120]   is to simply say it's cause effect.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.060]   If you delight, then you get your desires.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.540]   Or if you devote yourself to good, then you get good.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.700]   Now I think the relationship is, yes, cause effect,
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.220]   but more than cause effect.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.500]   I think delighting yourself in the Lord
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.300]   is what shapes the desires of your heart
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.300]   so that it will be good for you for God to grant them.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.020]   In other words, there are a lot of desires in our hearts
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.900]   that are impure and unwise, and this is not a promise
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.100]   that if you delight in God,
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.680]   then you get all those evil desires in your heart.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.280]   And the best way to bring the desires of our hearts
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.860]   into conformity with God is to put all of our energy
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.540]   and all of our effort into enjoying God himself.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.980]   When we enjoy God, not just his gifts, but God himself,
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.060]   then the desires of our heart are shaped,
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.060]   are defined and created in accord with our delight in him.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.820]   So when he gives us our desires,
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.660]   he will not be contradicting his own supreme value
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.900]   in our lives as our supreme delight.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.500]   It's very similar to what Jesus said in John 15, 7.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.780]   He said, "If you abide in me and my words abide in you,
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.180]   ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you."
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.980]   So there's this condition of words abiding in you,
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.660]   presumably because when words of Jesus really abide
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.300]   and take root in our passion and our satisfaction,
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.140]   that shapes what we pray for
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.140]   so that the answers come more surely, more regularly.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.300]   So the reason those who delight themselves in the Lord
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.020]   receive the desires of their heart
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.140]   is not just because one causes the other,
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.340]   but because one shapes the other.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.620]   Delighting in God supremely determines, shapes,
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.460]   the kinds of desires that we have in our heart.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.300]   - Brilliant.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.740]   - So I think the root of the matter is
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.020]   that Oprah in general leans away
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.100]   from the specific, particular,
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.300]   distinct dimensions of biblical reality
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   and leans toward abstractions from those specific realities
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.940]   so that she can pursue her goal of finding unity
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.620]   among the religions and the sciences of the world.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.100]   Now, I think that's the opposite
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.260]   of what the Bible was written to do,
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.580]   and I think it's the opposite
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.860]   of why Jesus came into the world.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.020]   - It's hard to make it more clear than that.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.820]   Delighting in God is what we are all about
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.660]   at Desiring God, that God is most glorified in us
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.780]   when we are most satisfied in him,
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.860]   and that delight changes everything,
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.620]   and it shapes everything that we do.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.180]   For more information about John Piper and his writings
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.100]   and the writings of others who cherish this truth,
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.120]   you can find us online at desiringgod.org.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.380]   Well, Jesus is alive.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.580]   Amen, he is alive.
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.820]   He is not dead, he is not absent,
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.740]   he is not boring, and he is not predictable,
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.220]   and the book of Acts proves it,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.820]   as we'll see tomorrow.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.660]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
