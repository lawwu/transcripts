[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.220]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.000]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.740]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.120]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.520]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.580]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.020]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.500]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.720]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.920]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.240]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.580]   But don't forget,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.120]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.320]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.800]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.400]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to be back with you today.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.240]   We've had six weeks of summer book club and summer reading.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.640]   And while I have enjoyed sharing stories
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.400]   with you and your kids,
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.600]   I'm super excited to get back to interviewing people
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.800]   who can help us all grow in our understanding
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.940]   of classical education, yes,
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.940]   but also in ways of building a family culture of learning.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.220]   How can we do this big, audacious task
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.580]   of educating the next generation together?
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.140]   And how can our families learn to love one another more
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.140]   and see Jesus more every day by learning together?
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.740]   So today I have one of my dearest friends,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.520]   Heatherly, and she is gonna talk to us
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.860]   about building a family culture of learning
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.860]   around something that may either intimidate you
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.180]   or let's be real, not excite you very much.
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.820]   Heatherly Sylvia is the very one
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.360]   to get you more excited about Latin.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.460]   So Heatherly, thank you for coming on today.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.140]   - I am so excited to be here.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.620]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.300]   - I always love to talk to you
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.460]   because I always learn something from you.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.700]   You always have a nugget of wisdom
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.380]   that the Lord has shown you
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.100]   as you have walked this homeschooling journey
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.220]   with your children.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.220]   And so I wanna take you way back, maybe to the beginning,
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.580]   when you guys were looking into classical conversations,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.260]   what did you think when you discovered
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.220]   that your kids would be learning Latin
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.140]   in the challenge program?
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.300]   And when did you discover that?
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.460]   When you first found the program,
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.180]   when your kids first got into the challenge years,
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.020]   what did you think?
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.460]   - Well, I first discovered that we would be learning Latin
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.940]   when someone first handed me the foundation's guide
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.940]   in order to encourage me.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.820]   I've shared this story before,
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.700]   but I was actually brought into classical conversations
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.460]   by a friend who had started the year before me.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.740]   And she was able to show me
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.580]   how Cece could give me the tools I needed
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.780]   to be confident in homeschooling.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.580]   There were some things I was just lacking
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.900]   and Cece gave me those tools.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.060]   So when I first looked at the challenge guide,
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.500]   I saw that Latin was one of the pieces of new grammar.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.660]   And I thought it was great.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.180]   I'm a nerd.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.500]   I love learning new things.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.820]   The idea of learning Latin alongside of my kids
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.620]   at that point sounded just really fun
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.420]   because we were learning, I started in cycle three.
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.180]   So we were actually learning part of the Latin Vulgate.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.820]   We were learning John one, one through seven.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.060]   So I thought it was just fun.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.940]   And I thought it was a fun party trick.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.940]   It wasn't until the first time I looked at the Latin one,
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.420]   the Henley Latin one,
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.380]   that I started to get a little nervous.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.900]   And thankfully I had been in Cece for three years
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.260]   at that point when I stepped into challenge.
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.180]   So I knew that Cece was gonna give me
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.700]   the tools I needed to learn
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.060]   and the tools I needed in order to teach my children.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.060]   So it was sort of a mixture of excitement,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.420]   enjoyment, intimidation.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.460]   And please don't misunderstand me.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.820]   I'm a passionate Latin student now.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.940]   I was not a passionate Latin student
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.060]   when I first started challenge.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.140]   It was not one of the strands I was most excited about.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.180]   So I truly was won over.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.260]   - I think that's awesome.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.340]   And I love that you brought out the fact
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.820]   that your first exposure to Latin
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.340]   was not in the challenge program,
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.260]   but in the foundation years.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.300]   That's really cool.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.100]   So let me ask you this.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.620]   If you were talking to a first time Cece family,
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.180]   would you be able to say that the Latin memory work
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.020]   that you did with your children in foundations
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.060]   helped you get ready for deeper Latin studies later?
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.500]   - My favorite thing is when the kids come into challenge
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.900]   and they realize that they already know
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.420]   so much of the Latin because they've memorized it
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.420]   in the form of noun declension and verb conjugations.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.100]   And it's such a gift.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.580]   And do they come in knowing all the details
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.180]   or understanding how it works?
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.140]   No, but when you turn in,
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.340]   I think it's week one or week two of challenge A
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.580]   and they have to memorize
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.260]   the first declension noun endings
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.180]   and anyone who's been in foundations already knows them.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.180]   Don't let that discourage you if you come in challenge
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.820]   and you're not a foundations parent
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.700]   because you can just borrow the CD or download the app
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.660]   and quickly learn the same songs the other kids did.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.660]   Very, very quickly.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.100]   But I found it helpful.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.340]   I found it really helpful to just have that
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.660]   and for my kids to very quickly be able to connect
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.620]   the foundations work.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.260]   I think a lot of times our parents don't understand
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.420]   how carefully the foundations memory work was curated
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.740]   and that every bit of it is used in some way
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.100]   in one of the challenge levels, if not many of them.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.020]   - That's really true.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.940]   And I believe that you're right.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.540]   I know that when our family got involved
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.700]   and it was a long time ago, admittedly,
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.620]   I did not realize how much my children would carry forward
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.980]   into the challenge program.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.540]   And sometimes, like you were implying,
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.620]   sometimes the carry over was slight.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.460]   But for instance, in Latin,
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.380]   it was nice for my children to go into challenge
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.700]   looking at this foreign language.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.500]   And it was actually not completely foreign to them
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.980]   because they had been looking at these words
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.420]   and thinking about words having endings for years.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.700]   And so that was a blessing.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.820]   So let me ask you this.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.740]   Did you have a Latin background?
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.540]   Did you take Latin in high school or junior high or anything?
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.940]   Did you have any kind of Latin background
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.700]   before you dipped into Latin with your kids?
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.700]   - When I was in sixth grade,
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.180]   we had a sixth grade event called Rome Day
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.140]   where we all dressed in togas
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.140]   and did the approximation of ancient Roman activities.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:18.900]   And our assistant principal had either been
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.540]   in a Catholic school growing up
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.700]   or had worked at a Catholic school
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.180]   and taught us the Old Grey Mare in Latin.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.020]   - Oh, how fun.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.660]   - Which I remembered very badly when I actually went,
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.300]   became someone that actually cared and thought about Latin.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.300]   And I thought about what I was singing.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.940]   I realized I had really--
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.780]   - Butchered that.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.780]   - Really butchered it over the years.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.860]   I mean, sixth grade was a long time ago now,
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.740]   but that was my only exposure to Latin
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.740]   other than just as a student coming across expressions
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.380]   and realizing that they were Latin.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.500]   But other than the fact that it sprinkled
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.420]   throughout our English writing
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.340]   and in our United States history
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.940]   and United States documents,
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.180]   I didn't have any exposure to Latin at all.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.220]   And it actually was very exciting for me
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.780]   that I was going to learn Latin
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.180]   because I really loved the idea
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.900]   of being able to eventually read
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.500]   the original Latin documents like the Aeneid,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.340]   being able to read that in Latin.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.500]   I knew, and I was right, years later,
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.380]   to be able to start piecing together my own translation
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.060]   and read it for understanding.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.900]   And I was really excited about that.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.620]   I love that idea.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.140]   - That is so cool.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.580]   I will say that to some of our listeners
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.260]   that may come out as super nerdy.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.260]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.300]   I own it, I own it.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.020]   - I appreciate that.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.060]   I appreciate that.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.900]   Okay.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:57.500]   So I know that we are talking to a lot of listeners
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.540]   who maybe aren't as nerdy as you or nerdy as me even.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.300]   And so they may be sitting here thinking,
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.980]   well, great, you wanted to learn this hard thing
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.620]   and you were looking forward to, for some reason,
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.020]   translating original Latin documents.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.780]   But I am just trying to survive homeschooling with my kids.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.700]   And so I know we're talking to a lot of parents
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.700]   who don't have a Latin background.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.860]   And so I'm easing us into thinking about this.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.020]   And I want to say to parents,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.020]   if you're listening and that's you,
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.620]   you don't have a background
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.540]   and you never really thought about wanting to do this
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.860]   and now yet here you are.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.660]   And we feel your pain
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.820]   and there are other people who have felt your pain.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.820]   Heatherly, what initially intimidated you
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.100]   about learning a language as an adult?
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.020]   - The first thing that intimidated me
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   was the fact that I had so little of a base
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.340]   of understanding it.
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.940]   I had studied foreign language in high school,
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.100]   but not successfully.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.380]   I didn't have to take foreign language in college
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.180]   for my degree because my degree was a Bachelor of Science
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.260]   and my university didn't require it.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.660]   So I didn't really know how to learn a foreign language.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.740]   I didn't know how to approach it.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.500]   The book looked boring, everything looked scary.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.580]   Why are there two books?
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.660]   Why are we doing the same book for three years?
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.500]   So there were a lot of things that I looked at it
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.820]   and I just got very overwhelmed, very overwhelmed.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.380]   - Yeah, that is good.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.580]   So-
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.300]   - It's normal, it's very normal.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.340]   - I was gonna say, that is good to hear you say that
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.620]   because a lot of us, you get these fat books
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.620]   and you open them up and 90% of the words you can't read
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.460]   and you're supposed to figure out the language
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.940]   and the system for learning the language.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.460]   And like you said, if you don't have any experience at all
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.060]   with learning a foreign language,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.140]   you think I don't even know how to do this.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.700]   It's not that I don't know this,
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.140]   I don't know how to learn this.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.620]   Had other people made Latin seem like a hard,
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.700]   scary mountain to climb?
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.460]   - I have to think about that.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.620]   I don't think so.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.580]   Our community was pretty young when I stepped into Latin.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.020]   And so there had been a few people that had gone before me.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.420]   I am a support representative,
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.580]   which means that I support challenge tutors
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.420]   and I was supporting challenge tutors before I became one.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.740]   And they were not overwhelmed by it.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.780]   They talked about how it was hard work in the beginning
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.380]   just to get into a rhythm and into a routine
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.300]   and for them to remember how to memorize vocabulary
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.140]   and things like that.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.540]   But no, I actually had a lot of encouragement.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.540]   I also had a, I assigned myself as an SR,
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.020]   I assigned myself a challenge mentor.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.700]   And that is my good friend, Jennifer Deverex,
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.700]   who now is a certified Latin apprentice through Circe.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.980]   So I had a good mentor to just go ahead of me and say,
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.580]   read the book, like actually read the Henley One book,
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.780]   because if you try to skip and just do the exercises,
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.540]   but you haven't read what Father Henley is saying,
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.300]   it doesn't make any sense.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.140]   - Right, right.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.540]   - But actually just take a few minutes
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.420]   and read what he's saying.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.980]   It's actually very logical.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.820]   - Oh, that's good.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.180]   - And so that was the best piece of encouragement,
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.140]   the best piece of advice I was given.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.340]   Just read the book.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.420]   - I love that.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.660]   You know, here's the thing, parents,
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.940]   your students are not inclined to read the book.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.660]   You know, you're teenagers,
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.340]   they are inclined to find the exercises
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.620]   and do the best they can with what they saw in class.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.460]   They don't want to read the book.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.380]   So don't be like your students, read the book.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.700]   That's really, that's really,
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.500]   and then you'll be able to help them
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.380]   because you will have read the book.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.860]   - So it sounds like what you're saying, Heather Lee,
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.860]   is that we as parents really need to become
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.940]   the lead learner in our home for Latin studies.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.620]   I mean, I know that there are probably
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.180]   lots of parents out there who were hoping
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.740]   that we were going to say,
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.820]   "Oh, you don't really need to be the,
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.860]   you don't need to learn it along with your kids.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.300]   You just help them read the syllabus, read the guide,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.980]   make a plan, crack the whip over their flashcards
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.260]   and their exercise production, and it'll all be fine."
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.940]   But it sounds like you were saying,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.140]   "Mm, the better way is to be the lead learner."
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.140]   - I tell my parents in my area frequently
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.020]   that the classical education does not happen
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.300]   instantaneously, it's not guaranteed
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.860]   just by checking the boxes in the challenge guide
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.220]   and getting the work done.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.180]   If you're handing your children the work to do
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.740]   and they're doing it, even if they're doing it really well,
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.660]   that's not where the classical education is happening.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.300]   That's where the good content is happening.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.220]   But the classical education,
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.220]   the idea of the mentor leading the student,
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.860]   the practicing of the tools, the Socratic dialogues,
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.780]   the mimetic lessons, all of those classical tools
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.260]   that make this a classical education
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.260]   as opposed to just really well-curated good content,
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.780]   that happens at the table, shoulder to shoulder.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:07.780]   And if you are not, at least in some capacity,
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.660]   sitting shoulder to shoulder with your students,
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.100]   then you are missing out on the best parts
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.500]   of having a classical education.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.100]   - Oh my goodness, I feel like, okay, all you listeners,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.980]   you need to stop the tape and roll it back just a minute
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.780]   and listen to all of that again.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.780]   That is, I suspect that will be the gem from this podcast
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:40.260]   that you can give your student the content
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.460]   of a classical education if you turn them loose
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.140]   with the guide and all of the resources.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.420]   You cannot give them a classical education
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.300]   if you don't sit and learn together,
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.180]   if you don't mentor them, if there's no relationship.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.180]   A classical education is a relationship education.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.140]   That's so good, Heather Lee.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.980]   Okay, so let's do it this way.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.660]   Lots of our parents who are listening
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.660]   have been through IEW with their children
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.740]   with their essentials kids,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.580]   and some of them have been through lost tools of writing.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.500]   And more of us know how to write an essay
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.020]   than know how to speak Latin.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.260]   So let's do this.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.260]   Pretend that I ask you to write a persuasive essay
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.900]   about learning Latin with your kids.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.340]   What would your exhortium be?
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.860]   I mean, how are you gonna go about
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.100]   grabbing a hold of parents
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.900]   so that they listen to what you have to say?
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.260]   - So one of the types of exhortia that we learn about
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260]   in lost tools of writing is a quote.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.300]   And I actually have two quotes that I would use.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.180]   So my first would be from Deuteronomy six,
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.140]   and it would be verse seven, which is right in the middle.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.580]   So please go read Deuteronomy six for the context.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.180]   It says, you shall teach them diligently to your children,
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.860]   meaning the words of God,
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.700]   and shall talk of them when you sit in your house
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.540]   and when you walk by the way,
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.540]   when you lie down and when you rise.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.500]   And we know that that doesn't mean
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.980]   just in those four times.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.780]   We know that that encompasses,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.780]   that means everything that happens in between
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.180]   sitting in your house and walking by the way
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.660]   and lying down and rising.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.140]   So you're supposed to teach them diligently always.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.540]   So I would use that quote.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.460]   We need to teach the things of God.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.180]   And of course the refutation of that people would say,
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.460]   well, Latin isn't the things of God.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.220]   Latin is created by man.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.220]   And as I'll talk about later in C,
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.220]   when I'm giving my proofs,
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.940]   I believe that studying Latin
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.860]   will help us to think thoughts after God.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.340]   - Lovely.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.460]   That's really good.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.900]   That's a great exhortium.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.100]   Who among us as parents
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.180]   don't want to have more conversations
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.460]   with our children about the Lord?
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.580]   And there are probably few of us
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.820]   who automatically associate studying Latin
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.460]   with talking about Jesus.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.180]   So that's really cool.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.580]   I like that.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.140]   All right, what would your thesis be?
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.100]   What's your thesis?
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.100]   Why is it so important to learn Latin alongside our kids?
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.620]   - My thesis, so for three reasons,
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.780]   a parent should learn Latin alongside of their child
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.340]   for three reasons.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.460]   First, if a parent does it,
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.220]   it shows the student that you believe it's valuable.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.940]   Second, studying Latin improves the way you think.
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.220]   And third, studying hard things is a natural way
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.660]   to build a relationship with your child
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.540]   and to increase your discipleship opportunities.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.620]   - Ooh, I love that.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.620]   So I mean, I could definitely pontificate on each of those.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.340]   So the first, if a parent does it,
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.020]   it shows that you think it's valuable.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.540]   I grew up in a home, and I think I'm Gen X,
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.020]   I'm a little bit older now,
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.780]   but I definitely grew up in a time
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.260]   when parents said, I say jump, you say how high, right?
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:00.260]   It was do what I say and not necessarily what I do.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:06.140]   And the way our culture often says is do what I say,
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.260]   but not what I'm not willing to do.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.620]   You do it because it's good for you,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.060]   but I'm not gonna do it because I don't want to.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.060]   And the other piece of that is that our culture says,
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:25.300]   you do you, you do what makes you happy, find your identity.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   And when you are doing this alongside of your children,
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.100]   when you are learning, even if you only learn 10%
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.580]   of what they end up learning over their six years of Latin,
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.980]   what you're doing in that shoulder-to-shoulder time
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.860]   learning Latin together is you are adding
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.380]   to your family culture.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.620]   There are things that you are learning
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.780]   that are going to become inside jokes.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.500]   They're gonna become things that you can refer back to.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.180]   It just, and you are showing them by doing that,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.900]   you're showing them this is important.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.660]   It's valuable to me.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.220]   My friend Naomi used to say her daughter
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.220]   would sometimes maybe not have all of the Latin done
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.940]   that she was expected to do.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.940]   And Naomi would say, I know that you had the time
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.700]   because I made the time for you.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.020]   So that's something that we need to do,
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.300]   that Latin cannot be the thing that just gets shoved
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.980]   at the end of the day and the kids do if they have time.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.340]   We need to show them that it is valuable.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.860]   We're gonna make time.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.420]   We're gonna carve time out of our schedule.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.740]   And don't misunderstand me.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.700]   I am not saying that four days a week for an hour
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.660]   that you're sitting and doing Latin shoulder-to-shoulder.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.180]   I understand that many of us,
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.620]   our schedules don't allow for that,
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.540]   or just the makeup of our family,
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.260]   the age of our other children,
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.420]   how many children we have doesn't always allow for that.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.100]   But if you are carving out some time regularly,
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:06.140]   that is going to show more than you telling them,
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.020]   it's gonna show them that this is something
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.300]   that I see as valuable.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.580]   And honestly, if you are a parent listening
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.060]   and you're like, but Heather Lee,
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.980]   I don't think Latin is valuable.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.460]   I don't understand.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.620]   I don't agree.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.980]   I think we should be doing something different.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.740]   That's okay.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.860]   But would you pray to have an open mind about it?
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.460]   Because there is a reason that Latin has been studied
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.860]   since the medieval time.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.740]   There is a reason that this was one
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.340]   of the classical languages that was carried forth.
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.700]   There's a reason why it's important
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.980]   and that so many classical curricula
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.380]   use Latin as their language.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.900]   Ask God to show you, pray with your student
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.740]   and say, show us why this is valuable.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.820]   Show us why this is important.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.300]   And then have a teachable spirit.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.580]   Be willing to have your mind changed
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.300]   because when you do that,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.700]   God will show you his purpose for you in this.
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.380]   And there are plenty of articles out there
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.060]   on the reasons that we should study Latin.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.580]   And I know that this is not an apology
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.740]   for why we study Latin.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.340]   We're not giving you our reasons
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.660]   why we should study Latin.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.380]   We're gonna assume you know that.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.660]   But if you don't know that, if you're not convinced,
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.900]   pray and ask God to show you 'cause he will.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.300]   There's some cool nuggets in there.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.540]   - That's really good.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.980]   I love your first reason.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.420]   And you're right.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.420]   If a parent makes time to do this shoulder to shoulder
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:53.220]   with their student, the parent is illustrating,
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.260]   not just saying, but illustrating
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.940]   that this is a valuable study endeavor.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.460]   And it might be valuable for a lot of reasons.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.460]   It might be valuable because we'll all have Latin mastered
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.260]   in six years.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.260]   It might be valuable because we will spend hours
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.220]   and hours and hours, shoulder to shoulder,
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.220]   studying and excelling together over six years.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:29.580]   But the nugget for me is that great truth
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.940]   that we make time for what is important.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.740]   And if we carve out time with our student,
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.580]   for Latin, we are illustrating to them this,
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.020]   this is one of the important things
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.460]   that our family will stand on together.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.540]   And I like that.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.100]   Very good, very good.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.860]   All right, so talk to us about that second reason
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.060]   that studying Latin actually improves our thinking.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   - So Latin is a very methodical, logical language.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.780]   It is very precise.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.500]   And I think better
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.300]   because I have learned to be more careful
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.740]   in the things that I write because of my study of Latin.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:27.100]   English is just such a difficult language
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.060]   because it is such a mixture of so many languages.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.060]   But in Latin, you learn precision, you learn conciseness.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.580]   And it is more precise than English
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.060]   in almost every situation.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.820]   Also, and this is something that I've talked about a lot
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.580]   with Jennifer who started out as my Latin mentor
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.940]   and now is my Latin teacher.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.620]   I actually have, I'm taking a class with her
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.220]   'cause I wanna be a better Latin student.
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.980]   But she has emphasized that language is tied
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.980]   to the worldview of the native speaker.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.900]   So it gives us a different perspective.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.980]   When you read Latin, and we start in challenge two,
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.940]   we start reading original writings.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.980]   We read Caesar, we read Cicero, we read Virgil.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.140]   And you learn so much about their culture
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.140]   and their worldview and where they were coming from
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.500]   when you read the way that they wrote.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.860]   Learning about the way that the Latins talked about time.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.180]   They spoke of time so differently than we do in America.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.500]   And even that alone just helps you to just think differently
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.940]   to expand your understanding, to think about other cultures
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.940]   and the fact that the way that you or your family
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.500]   or your region or your country does things
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.580]   is not the only way.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.180]   And also we're improving our thinking
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.980]   because so much of America is a result
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.060]   of how the Romans thought.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.260]   So you will better understand American politics,
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.820]   American history, if you understand the Romans.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.420]   And the best way to study the Romans
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.940]   is to read what the Romans wrote
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.460]   and to understand what the Romans wrote.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.580]   If you wanna know why we are a republic
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:25.100]   and not a democracy, then you need to read
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:30.140]   the writings of the Romans as they talk about the republic.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:36.020]   So if you wanna avoid having a dictator, read the Romans
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.820]   and see what happens when they had emperors.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.140]   So it's a really important piece.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.420]   So it both helps you with your thinking with content,
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.060]   like it's actually filling you with this content
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:53.060]   that helps you to just think through a broader lens,
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.180]   but it also just because it is such a methodical,
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.540]   precise language, it just makes you a better thinker,
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.460]   a better speaker, a better writer, a better communicator.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.820]   - I like that.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.660]   I like that.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.460]   I don't know if I've ever heard anyone articulate
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.620]   that Latin will help us to be better communicators,
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.500]   both better writers and better speakers
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:21.500]   because it encourages us to use precise language
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:27.300]   and concise language so that we can say exactly
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.620]   what we mean and not too much of it
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:37.340]   so that we leave people with our exact thoughts
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:43.020]   and reasons and space to think about it.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.100]   I like that.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.100]   It's really good.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.100]   So the third reason that Latin with our children
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.740]   is that it's a discipleship opportunity.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.860]   - It is.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.100]   I believe that every piece of homeschooling
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.940]   is a discipleship opportunity.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.860]   I take discipleship and mentorship very seriously.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.660]   In my life, Titus 2 is one of the most important sections
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.660]   of scripture for me as a leader, as a parent, as a friend.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:24.300]   And in Titus 2, they talk about how the older women
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.860]   should train the younger women and the older men
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.940]   should teach the younger men.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.780]   And it talks about loving your husbands,
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.620]   for the women specifically,
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.500]   it talks about training the young women
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.540]   to love their husbands and children,
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.700]   to be self-controlled and pure, working at home,
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.220]   being kind and submissive to their own husbands,
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.060]   that the word of God may not be reviled.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:52.060]   That's Titus 2, verses four and five.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.060]   I believe that a lot of times, the background work,
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:03.380]   the hard things that we do outside of loving our husbands
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.380]   and loving our children and following God,
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.540]   I believe that the hard things that we do,
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.460]   even if we cannot see them as connected
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.740]   to those bigger picture callings that we all have,
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.100]   I see that all as developing piety.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.260]   So in the classical tradition,
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.140]   piety is having your loves properly ordered.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.420]   It's knowing that it's loving God,
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.940]   then loving others, and then loving yourself.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.580]   It's knowing that we have a responsibility
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.220]   to be faithful spouses and to be parents
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.060]   that train our children in the fear and admonition
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:46.260]   of the Lord and give them all that they need
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.860]   and all the instruction and wisdom of the Lord
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.100]   without driving them to exasperation.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.580]   And that's Ephesians six.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.140]   And I believe that when we sit shoulder to shoulder
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.700]   and we look at our student
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.740]   and they're frustrated with Latin or they don't understand,
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.980]   I believe we can model the fruit of the spirit.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.020]   I believe we can model doing hard things,
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.140]   that we can build resilience in them, perseverance,
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.900]   that we can teach them to do the things
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.380]   that they don't want to do on a small scale,
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.100]   because a lot of the Christian life is sacrifice.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.540]   A lot of the Christian life is doing the right thing,
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.540]   even when it's not the thing that you want to be doing.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.020]   We have to die to self all the time.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.900]   And I know that it sounds dramatic
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.900]   to say that studying Latin is dying to self, but isn't it?
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.540]   When you're taking a half an hour
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.860]   and sitting with your child shoulder to shoulder
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.380]   and reading through these exercises,
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.580]   or studying the vocabulary,
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.180]   when we're setting aside our own desires
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.580]   in order to show our kids that this is important,
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.940]   and it's not just important
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.420]   because someday you'll get to read the Aeneid,
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:02.420]   it's important because when we have self-control
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.540]   over our bodies, when we are able to train ourselves
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.740]   to do the things that we're asked to do,
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.100]   even when we don't like them,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.420]   especially when we don't like them,
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.740]   that that's honoring to God.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.260]   It's honoring to our neighbor.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.580]   We're honoring our classmates.
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.980]   We're honoring our tutor.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.380]   We're honoring each other in this.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.220]   And it's okay to say this is hard,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:29.820]   but the joy when it starts to click,
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.060]   either for you or for your student,
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.980]   the excitement that comes from that.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.500]   When my daughter was in challenge B,
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.300]   she suddenly realized that she actually liked Latin.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:48.020]   And we came to a passage that Father Henley included
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.820]   in the Henley One textbook on Pearl Harbor,
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.460]   remembering that Father Henley wrote this textbook
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.380]   right at World War II hadn't yet ended
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.740]   when it was published.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.420]   And so it was talking in past tense
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.100]   about what the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor,
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.940]   which she knew about from foundation's memory work.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.940]   And then suddenly it turns to the present tense
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.260]   and it's talking about our sailors and our soldiers
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.780]   and how brave they are.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.100]   And what a joy it was to just sit and talk about that
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.940]   and talk about what it must have felt like
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.260]   to be a student reading about Pearl Harbor
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.620]   and knowing that your neighbors or your family members
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.740]   might be overseas fighting in that war.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.100]   It was a joy.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.260]   It was an absolute joy.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.260]   And so that began her kind of taking her Latin
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.260]   to the next level and her taking ownership of it
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.100]   and actually enjoying it because it had meaning.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.420]   For me, that meaning came the first time
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.860]   that I walked through Henley One
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.500]   with a Challenge One class.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.980]   And we came to this reading on the Trinity.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.540]   And I did not grow up in a Christian home.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.180]   All of the Christian teachings are things that I learned
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.980]   between the ages of 15 and now at 46.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:18.380]   And I had never heard the Trinity explained
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.380]   the way Father Henley explains it in Latin.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.380]   And the joy of hearing that there are not three gods,
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.620]   there is one God.
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:34.060]   And there is one Father and one Son and one Holy Spirit.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.100]   But for some reason, reading it in Latin
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.220]   and understanding it from the Latin
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.140]   just brought a new depth to my understanding of the Trinity
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.980]   that didn't come from reading theology textbooks
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.900]   or from debating the Trinity
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.140]   from my non-Trinitarian friends.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.580]   Just reading it in Latin made me stop
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.060]   and think about it differently.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.500]   It got into my bones in a different way.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.660]   And I will always love it.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.220]   And for those of you that have your Henley One book
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.340]   sitting on the shelf, it's reading number 28.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.180]   I encourage you to go read it.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.700]   Most of it, if you have any understanding of Christianity,
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.220]   even with no understanding of Latin,
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.340]   you'll be able to figure out most of it.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.740]   And it's just a beautiful, soothing reading.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.940]   - That's lovely.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.940]   What a great testimony.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.900]   And I love that you and your daughter
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.740]   were drawn in to conversation
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.540]   about something that was not Latin
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:48.380]   because you were studying how to read this passage in Latin.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.380]   I love it that your Latin studies gave you opportunity
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:58.820]   to discuss something deeply meaningful to Americans.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.180]   That's really neat.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.020]   I love that.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.020]   I know in a persuasive essay,
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:08.020]   we always have to acknowledge the real objections
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.100]   that someone might have to our position
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.340]   and your position that we should study Latin
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.500]   alongside our students.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.940]   What objections have you heard?
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.460]   And how would you,
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.060]   I want you to offer your refutations too, of course,
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.940]   but what objections have you heard
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.780]   that we can sympathize with
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.340]   and yet urge people to overcome?
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.940]   - The most common objection that I hear
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.060]   is from parents that maybe didn't get this message
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.140]   into them before they started Challenge A
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.340]   with their student.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   So now their student has done some Latin independently.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.300]   And the biggest objection I hear from those parents
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.580]   is they are doing just fine without me.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.860]   And this is a perfect time for us to remember
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.860]   that we do not put our kids in CC only
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:14.860]   for an academically excellent education.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.380]   We do not classically educate our kids
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.300]   for an academically excellent education.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.020]   We put them in a classical program
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.660]   because it is a virtuous education.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:32.660]   It makes us more like the man, capital M, Jesus.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:37.980]   It makes us more like the ideal
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.420]   of who we were meant to be before the fall.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.060]   And we do that through obedience
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.500]   and through working out our sanctification.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.340]   So patience, love, joy, peace,
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.380]   kindness, goodness, self-control, right?
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:58.380]   And C.S. Lewis says that when we put the first things first,
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.500]   meaning a virtuous education,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.020]   we want our kids to have an education
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:07.660]   filled with the fruit of the spirit and moral excellence.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.740]   And in our family, that includes having a strong work ethic
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.180]   and being resilient.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.780]   When we put those first things first,
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.180]   the second things get thrown in automatically, right?
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:25.180]   So we aim for virtue and academic excellence gets thrown in
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.500]   because when you have a student that is working diligently
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.540]   and being obedient and self-controlled
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.060]   and finding joy and love
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.420]   and pondering God's thoughts after him,
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:44.220]   you end up with an academically excellent education.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.740]   So your student may be getting all the vocabulary right.
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.020]   Your student may be doing all of the exercises,
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.060]   getting them 100%,
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.580]   and they may still not understand the value
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:03.580]   of the virtue that can be developed in studying Latin.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.140]   They maybe have checked the boxes,
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:12.140]   but they haven't become classically educated.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:17.180]   They haven't become virtuously educated in the process.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.180]   And so I would say you can have an A student
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.140]   and that A student still would benefit
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.300]   from sitting shoulder to shoulder with their parent
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.660]   and building that relationship
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.380]   and building that discipleship and learning together.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.940]   Because even an A student still has areas
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.020]   where they can improve.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.020]   And you, as the person with more life experience is going,
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.740]   that person, that parent is going to pull out nuggets
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.740]   from the text or have a perspective
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.660]   that that 14, 15, 16 year old
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.100]   just has not come across in their young life.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.180]   - Right.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.020]   - So that's my first.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.420]   My first is it doesn't matter
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.380]   if your child is doing really well without you.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.740]   We still want better for you and for them.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.780]   And of course, the second is I just don't have time.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.700]   Well, I would encourage you to figure out
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.500]   where you can find time.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.340]   I have one acquaintance that she and her daughter,
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.740]   her daughter was really not enjoying Latin.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.020]   So once a week, they would go to Starbucks.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.660]   She would buy her like the treatiest treat
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.860]   that the daughter wanted from the drink menu.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.820]   And then they would study Latin together.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.220]   And even though the daughter didn't necessarily
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.860]   fall in love with Latin,
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.820]   she fell in love with that time that they had together.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.900]   And it was an hour and a half out of the mom's week.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.980]   They got quality time together.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.340]   They had that time together in the car there and back.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.420]   And it was just uninterrupted time.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.180]   You can find ways creatively.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.700]   And if you truly don't think that you have time,
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.140]   I have friends with many children
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.300]   that are working jobs that have busy schedules.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.220]   It is legitimately difficult to find that time.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.580]   Again, I'm gonna encourage you, pray and ask God,
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.020]   what should this time look like?
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.660]   Is it 15 minutes where you just sit down
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.820]   and maybe you don't work on the vocab
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.460]   or the exercises together.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.100]   Maybe you just do the reading for that week together
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.660]   and you read about Jesus or you read about American history.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.500]   'Cause those are the two things covered in Henley One.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.260]   Maybe you don't learn a lot of Latin,
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.420]   but you learn enough to be able to have that conversation
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.860]   alongside of your student.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.380]   Maybe you're sitting there with your answer key open
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.500]   and you're letting your student teach you.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:00.900]   Either way, what beautiful humility that shows,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.180]   what diligence that shows,
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.300]   what that shows your child in just,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.740]   mom only has 20 minutes,
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.660]   but she's making that 20 minute count.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.500]   - She's giving it to me.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.660]   - Yeah, and she's giving it to me
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.180]   and she's giving it to me with Latin.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.460]   And I understand,
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.620]   I truly understand some of my closest friends,
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.420]   I've had this conversation with them
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.940]   and they're like, I don't want to, I don't want to.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.060]   And what I honestly have said is,
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.180]   for me, it's not Latin.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.020]   For me, Latin has not been the strand that I don't want to.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.580]   I will not tell you what they are
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.180]   because my people will come at me,
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:43.060]   but there are sections of the challenge curriculum
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.740]   that are very difficult for me and I don't want to.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:50.740]   And I recognize that it's not about me.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:55.420]   It is about me doing what's best for my student,
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.380]   doing what's best for our family,
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.100]   doing what's best for our community and our class,
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.140]   honoring my kid's tutor
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.700]   by helping my student to be as prepared
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.900]   for class as possible.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.580]   And so I understand that you might not want to
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.140]   because I feel that way about other areas.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:20.860]   But as members of a classical Christian community,
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:25.180]   let's endeavor for those things we don't want to do,
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.500]   for those things that are hard,
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.740]   for those things that we just don't see the value in,
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.060]   can you commit to praying and asking God
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.860]   to show you where the value is,
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.100]   to show you where the discipleship is,
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   to show you where the benefit is in you doing this?
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.020]   He will.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:50.140]   He may not make you fall in love with Latin,
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.580]   but he might have you fall in love
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.500]   with your time with your student.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.420]   He may not make you fall in love with Latin,
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.940]   but he is going to show you
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.180]   why he's called you to do this.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.700]   Because he's a good God
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.460]   and he gives wisdom without finding fault, James 1.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:11.460]   So even I'm not going to try to convince you,
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.300]   hopefully a few people will hear some of the things
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.260]   that I've shared and they'll be like,
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.940]   "Okay, you've convinced me."
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.140]   But if I haven't convinced you, that's okay.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.420]   The only thing I really want to convince you of
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.460]   is that it is there for a reason.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:31.820]   Classical educators have put Latin
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.100]   as one of the central pieces of what they do,
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.900]   of what makes it classical, as opposed to just good.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.740]   And I'm asking you to ask God to show you,
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.780]   you the value for you, for your family.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.220]   - That is so awesome.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:55.220]   I feel like we have not so much had a treatise
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:00.340]   on why study Latin as it is what God wants to do.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.100]   And it is get ahold of your heart
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:08.100]   and give you his heart for your children,
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.940]   your family, your community, your world.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.860]   I love all of this, Heatherly.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.860]   And I appreciate you prayerfully offering to us
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:26.700]   these great reasons to study Latin alongside our children.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.380]   Not to agree that Latin is good
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.140]   for our classically educated family,
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.180]   but to study shoulder to shoulder,
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:40.180]   to mentor your student and to love them
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:45.740]   as you lovingly study a subject together.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.660]   Thank you so much for your insights.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.620]   I really appreciate your time.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.900]   - You are so welcome.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.060]   - This has been great.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.960]   And you know, I suspect, parents,
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.300]   that you will find a lot of blessing
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:06.460]   from spending that time with your student.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:11.460]   You may never love Latin any more than you do now,
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.580]   but I bet you will love your student
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.900]   more than you ever have
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.780]   when you spend that discipling time with them.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:26.660]   You know, we wanna know what your communities are doing
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.300]   and we wanna know what you and your family
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.980]   have to celebrate together.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.420]   We really wanna know when your student
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:40.220]   or your community has done something noteworthy.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:45.220]   We are collecting stories of accomplishments and events
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.220]   so that we can celebrate together
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.140]   and share the excitement of homeschooling.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:56.300]   So if you want to share a success story,
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.540]   if you want somebody to celebrate with,
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.940]   we want you to provide us as much information as possible
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.140]   so that you completely tell the story.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:12.140]   If you want to share, go to classicalconversations.com/celebrate-together.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:20.540]   So that last part is all one word
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.740]   just with a dash in the middle.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:27.740]   Classicalconversations.com/celebrate-together.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:35.780]   And we want to hear some stories
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:40.780]   of families celebrating togetherness as they study Latin
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.900]   and as they experience the Lord's love
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.500]   in their learning culture together.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.660]   So thanks again, Heather Lee.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.700]   I appreciate you, friend.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.260]   And listeners, I'll see you next time.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.100]   Thanks.
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.980]   (gentle music)
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.040]   you
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.100]   you
