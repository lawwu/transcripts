[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   I was invited to give you a taste of a typical law school classroom experience here today,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.800]   and I thought I would take advantage of this opportunity to do something that's been on
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.320]   my mind for a while.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   To stand up and to proudly say, "God bless America.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.840]   God bless the Bill of Rights, and thank God for the Fifth Amendment."
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.240]   I'm not ashamed to say I'm proud of the Fifth Amendment, and I'm proud to admit on camera
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.000]   and on the Internet that I will never talk to any police officer under any circumstances,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.120]   with all due respect, sir.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.480]   I'm doing something really extraordinary here today, something you'll almost never see another
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.480]   law professor do as long as you live.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.880]   I'm really putting myself on the spot here.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880]   This was my idea.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.800]   By my invitation, I have given up half of my time, approximately.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.560]   I'm giving equal time and the last word to an expert who really knows something about
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.560]   what I'll be talking about.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.000]   So I'm opening myself up to the possibility that he will contradict me.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.280]   I was a criminal defense attorney when I was in private practice, so I want to make sure,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480]   in fairness to you, if I'm misleading you or giving you a slanted or one-sided presentation,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720]   you'll be able to get the last word from somebody else.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.840]   I'm sure he'll have a lot to teach all of us, including myself.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.840]   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, "No person shall be compelled in
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200]   any criminal case to be a witness against himself."
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.280]   And this unfortunate amendment has gotten a bad rap in recent times, much of it tragically
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   and unnecessarily through, as you may have heard, the headlines.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.360]   Let me read to you something that was taken out of the newspaper this morning, and I want
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360]   you to listen to it closely.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360]   And I'm giving you a heads up.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.000]   I'm warning you in advance, which is not fair to you.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600]   Not fair to me, but I'm giving you a warning that I'll be quizzing you on this in just
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.160]   a few minutes.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.720]   This will test your aptitude for legal study and legal practice.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   Listen closely.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.920]   It won't take long.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.120]   Last night, agents of the Norfolk Police Department found three victims of an apparent murder
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.360]   dead in an apartment in the East Ocean View area, the apparent victims of a gangland-style
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.960]   slaying and possibly the victims of gang-related violence.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   The police are investigating this as a possible murder and suicide, but right now suspect
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   that the three were all killed by the same individual.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.080]   No suspects have yet been identified in the slaying, but veteran police detective George
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.520]   Brooke has confirmed that police are following up on evidence pointing to the possible involvement
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.480]   of an off-duty naval officer as the perpetrator.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.960]   The bodies, which were found by the apartment manager at about 8 o'clock in the morning,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.560]   appear to have been slain sometime earlier in the same evening, probably sometime between
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.520]   midnight and 2 o'clock in the morning.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.360]   That's it.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320]   Those are all the facts I'll ask you to remember, and it won't be for very long either.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   Let's see how well you do.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'll be quizzing you in just a few minutes.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.420]   Now, here's the easiest question.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.160]   You'll ever get from a client in all the days of your life.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   Question, "Hey, the police are here.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.680]   They want to talk to me.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680]   What should I do?"
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.720]   Well, I could give you my answer to that question in case you haven't already guessed it, but
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.920]   why don't we go to a real expert, Justice Robert Jackson, a prosecutor's prosecutor.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.520]   Like me, he began his private practice in Buffalo, New York years before I did, and
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.200]   after that he served as general counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the U.S. Department
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.040]   of Treasury, the Security and Exchange Commission, assistant U.S. attorney general for the tax
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.660]   division, later the solicitor general and the attorney general of the United States,
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.740]   and then the chief U.S. prosecutor for the Nuremberg trials.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.600]   That's an impressive resume.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.740]   Years later, when he was a justice on the Supreme Court, Justice Jackson stated, "Any
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.900]   lawyer worth his salt," today we would say his or her, "will tell the suspect, his client,
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.260]   in no uncertain terms to make no statement to the police under any circumstances."
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.420]   There's the title of my talk.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.140]   I'm here to explain to you the surprising and somewhat counterintuitive and admittedly
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.020]   unlikely reasons why Justice Jackson was right.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.620]   I'm reminded of this because I'm amazed, we're all amazed, by the frequency with which we
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.320]   see newspaper articles coming out all the time from people who really ought to know
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.220]   better who say, "Well, I'll talk to the police.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.500]   I mean, after all, I'm a senator.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.100]   I'm O.J. Simpson.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.940]   I'm an experienced, highly polished individual.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.260]   I've got a lot of experience with public relations, even criminal defense attorneys."
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.020]   There was a local news story here in the Virginia Pilot just a couple of months ago about an
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.380]   experienced criminal defense lawyer who ended up getting convicted of criminal assault because
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.880]   he talked to the police.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.060]   He was accused of having assaulted another attorney in the hallway.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.140]   There were no other witnesses to this.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.460]   A woman said that he grabbed her by the throat during an argument over a case.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.460]   He denied it.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.420]   At trial, it was his word against hers.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.920]   He said, "I did not even touch her."
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.620]   But unfortunately for him, when the police had approached him earlier and said, "Would
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.020]   you be willing to answer some questions?"
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.700]   He said, "Sure, why not?
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   I'm an attorney.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.700]   I'm a criminal defense attorney.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   I'm savvy.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   I'm sophisticated.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.700]   I've got oratorical prowess.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.060]   I'm accustomed to dealing with the police by all means."
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.200]   And then there was a conversation that was not recorded.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.020]   When the case went to trial, it was no longer his word against hers because when he testified
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.540]   at trial, "I never touched her," the officer took to the stand and testified, "Well, when
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.500]   I met with him, he said he did put his hand on her throat, but just as a joke."
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.300]   Then he had to take the stand again and say, "That's not true.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   I never said that.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.300]   I never admitted to you that I..."
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.740]   Now it's his word against two people.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.740]   Who's telling the truth?
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.900]   We'll never know for sure, but he was found guilty.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.800]   Now here's part of the problem.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.580]   The heart of the problem, as Justice Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court explained in 1998,
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.160]   is, "The complexity of modern federal criminal law codified in several thousand sections
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.400]   of the United States Code and the virtually infinite variety of factual circumstances
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.180]   that might trigger an investigation into a possible violation of the law make it difficult
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.660]   for anyone to know in advance just when a particular set of statements might later appear
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.920]   to a prosecutor to be relevant to some investigation."
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.540]   One expert on criminal law recently noted that estimates of the current size of the
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.980]   body of federal criminal law vary, although it has been reported that the Congressional
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.940]   Research Service can no longer even count the current number of federal crimes.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.940]   That's right.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.280]   Even the federal government has lost count.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.580]   These laws are scattered over all 50 pages of the U.S. Code, encompassing roughly 27,000
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.580]   pages.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.820]   Worse yet, these statutes often incorporate by reference the provisions of administrative
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.060]   regulations.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.180]   Estimates of how many such regulations exist are even less well settled, although the ABA
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.340]   thinks there may be nearly 10,000.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.140]   Here's one of those 10,000 federal criminal statutes on the book that you probably never
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.140]   heard about.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.900]   It's called the Lacey Act, 16 U.S.C. section 3370.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.540]   Says it's a federal offense for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive,
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.380]   acquire, or purchase any fish or wildlife or plant taken, possessed, transported, or
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.740]   sold in the violation of any law, treaty, or regulation of the United States or any
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.700]   Indian tribal law or any state or any foreign law.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.300]   People have been convicted in federal court for violating this statute because they brought
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.340]   back a bony fish from Honduras, not knowing that Honduran law, not American, but Honduran
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.620]   law forbade the possession of the bony fish.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.180]   People have been convicted under the List Law because they were found in possession
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.940]   of what's called a short lobster, a lobster that's under a certain size.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.780]   Some states forbid you from possessing a lobster if he's under a certain length.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.080]   It doesn't matter if he's dead or alive.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.360]   It doesn't matter if you killed it or if he died of natural causes.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.780]   It doesn't even matter if you acted in self-defense.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.780]   Did you know that?
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.540]   Did you know it can be a federal offense to be in possession of a lobster?
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.540]   Admit it.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.740]   You did not know that.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.740]   There's the problem.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.620]   And that's only one of 10,000 different ways.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.780]   You know, the government gets pretty upset when people like me instructs the client,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.580]   people like me and Justice Jackson, "Don't talk to the police.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.580]   Don't answer any questions."
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.980]   But you know, they can't have it both ways.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.500]   You people, you've got 10,000 different ways of convicting us.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.580]   Good for you, but you know, where the bitter comes to the sweet, where the good comes to
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.980]   the bad, that's 10,000 different ways my client might unknowingly implicate himself in some
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.700]   sort of a criminal transaction.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.340]   One of the reasons I decided to give this talk, I recently received a phone call from
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.140]   a former student of mine, a regional law school graduate, who may be watching this online.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.600]   We're putting it on the internet.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.220]   And he told me, "Hey, I've been approached by the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.500]   They want to ask me a couple of questions.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.560]   They ask if I'd be willing to.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.700]   But they say that I'm not a suspect.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.700]   And I know in my heart I don't think I've done anything wrong in violation of the Internal
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   Revenue Service provisions."
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.940]   Lord have mercy.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.980]   There's no man on earth, there's no woman in this country who can honestly say with
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.820]   complete confidence, "I know I have never violated any provision of the Internal Revenue
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.820]   Code."
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.380]   He said, "But they say I'm not a suspect and I know I've done nothing wrong.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.660]   Is it okay if I talk to him?"
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.800]   I said, "No, no.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.100]   You tell them you will not talk to them without immunity."
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.860]   I explained to him why that was true and he never heard from them again.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.060]   Okay, why you should never talk to the police.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.060]   Let me just spell it out for you.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.420]   Let me make it plain to all of you.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.980]   These are the top ten reasons.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.180]   I don't want to actually really lie to you.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.180]   I don't really have ten.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.180]   I don't have time for ten.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.900]   But I've got time for eight and that'll be close enough.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.980]   Number one, and this really ought to be good enough.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.840]   Contrary to what you laymen instinctively and naturally suppose, it cannot help.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.300]   There is no way it can help you.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.700]   Plenty of folks think that it can and they're always wrong.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.660]   You cannot talk your way out of getting arrested.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.380]   Officer Brooke, you've interviewed thousands of criminal suspects.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.460]   Have you ever, how many times in your experience have you approached someone, asked if you
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.660]   could ask them some questions because prior to the interview you had some evidence pointing
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.660]   to his possible guilt?
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.740]   And because of the extraordinary persuasiveness and eloquence with which he articulated his
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.460]   innocence, you said, "Oh, sorry.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.460]   Never mind.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.460]   Bad call.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.460]   My bad.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.460]   I won't."
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.460]   And he talked you out of arresting him.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.460]   >>How do you know the answer to that?
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.460]   >>Never.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.460]   Never.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.460]   Never.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.460]   Never.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.460]   You know, all of you criminal defense attorneys, in all of your experience, have you ever once
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.060]   hit a case where you looked back in hindsight and said, "Thank God my client talked to the
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.060]   police.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.060]   They laugh at me.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.060]   They laugh at me.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.060]   They say, 'You've got to be kidding me.'"
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.060]   It cannot help you.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.060]   You can't talk your way out of getting arrested.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.060]   And contrary to what you might suppose if you never studied the rules of evidence, what
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.580]   you tell the police, even if it's exculpatory, cannot be used to help you at trial because
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.980]   it's what we call hearsay.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.560]   Under the rules of evidence, specifically Rule 801(d)(2)(A) if you want to look it
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.740]   up, everything you tell the police, as the saying goes, can and will be used against
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.340]   you, but it cannot be used for you.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.220]   From time to time, I've known attorneys who tried to call to the stand of police officers
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.420]   and say, "Officer, would you tell the jury what my client told you because what my client
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.100]   told him is actually good for my case?"
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.060]   If you tried that at trial, the prosecutor will object to that as hearsay, and the judge
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.060]   will agree.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.020]   The police will not be allowed, at your request, to tell the jury what your client told him,
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.700]   no matter how good it may be for your case.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.580]   It cannot help.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.580]   And that ought to be good enough reason.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.380]   That ought to be reason enough to keep your mouth shut.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.580]   But if you're not persuaded, let me go talk about a couple of others.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   Number two, obviously one of the most obvious, if your client is guilty, as many of them
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.500]   are, but even if he's not, even if he's innocent, he may well admit his guilt with
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.980]   no benefit in return.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.660]   Now, of course, many of you are thinking to yourself, "Well, what's so wrong about
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.660]   that?
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.340]   I mean, shouldn't guilty people be confessing?
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.620]   Confession's good for the soul.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.700]   It's good for law enforcement.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.700]   It's good for the prisons."
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.840]   Yes, yes, sure, all those things are true.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.260]   And like the rest of you, if I or anyone close to me is ever the victim of some sort of a
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.140]   serious crime, I hope they get the right guy.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.140]   I hope they convict him.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.140]   I hope they put him away.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.140]   We all feel that way.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.020]   Hey, but what's for the rush, friends?
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.820]   You don't got to admit your guilt the first time they come by to meet with you.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.780]   In federal court, 86% of all defendants plead guilty at some point before trial.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.280]   If your client is guilty and really ought to punish and really ought to go through some
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.140]   sort of a cleansing act of contrition and fess up and admit his guilt, there'll be plenty
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.140]   of time to do that.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.180]   They almost always do.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.180]   No need to rush.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.980]   No need to tell the police something.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.220]   Wait and see if perhaps your client can work out some sort of an arrangement where maybe
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.100]   he'll make some sort of compensation to the alleged victim or maybe he'll be able to get
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.180]   some sort of a discount in his sentence.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.060]   And he'll be treated fairly then like everybody else who had the benefit of a good lawyer
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.460]   who said, "Please do not talk to the police."
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:43.420]   And don't forget, by the way, even if your client only admits things that the police
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.780]   already knew, you might think, "Well, what harm can it do?
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.100]   He says he wants to talk to the police.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.620]   All he wants to do is admit that he was there, but the cops know that he was there.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.620]   All right, go ahead and tell them.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.620]   Well, how can it hurt?"
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.420]   It might hurt if the police officer becomes transferred to Minnesota or deceased or injured
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.740]   or comatose or cannot be located by the time of trial.
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.780]   The case will be dismissed if there's no confession.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.820]   But if your client admits two things, that confession is freely admissible against him
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.060]   and can be a basis for getting him convicted all by himself.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.420]   Senator Larry Craig can explain all this to you.
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:17.300]   The Innocence Project of the United States has confirmed that in more than 25% of all
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.180]   the cases where an innocent man was convicted and then later released from prison after
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.860]   he was exonerated by DNA evidence, in more than a quarter of those cases, these innocent
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.500]   people, people we know to be innocent, made incriminating statements, delivered outright
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.900]   confessions or pled guilty.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.900]   How do they do that?
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.700]   He'll tell us all about it, I trust.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.940]   Here's a couple of famous examples.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.940]   You can just ask them.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.180]   You don't have to take my word for it.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.100]   There on the left is Eddie Joe Lloyd.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.440]   He was convicted in 1984 of the murder of a 16-year-old girl in Detroit after he wrote
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.540]   to police with suggestions on how to solve various recent crimes.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.140]   During several interviews, police fed details of the crime to Mr. Lloyd, who was mentally
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.420]   ill, and they lied to him and convinced this mentally ill man that by confessing, he might
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   help them smoke out the real killer.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.420]   He later signed a confession.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.280]   He gave a tape-recorded statement.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.840]   The jury delivered it less than one hour before convicting him on the basis of this confession.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.740]   There was no other substantial evidence against him.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.180]   The judge said, "I'd hang you if I could," but the death penalty was not available in
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.340]   Michigan at the time.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.220]   But after almost two decades in prison, he was released after DNA evidence proved that
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.780]   this man was innocent and had falsely confessed to a crime that he did not commit.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.740]   On the right is Earl Washington, who was released from prison just a few years ago here in Virginia
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.340]   after spending 18 years behind bars after being committed of a rape and a murder that
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.900]   we now know he did not commit after having been exonerated by DNA evidence.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.820]   But this man, Mr. Washington, who was in fact confirmed to be mentally retarded, was able
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.580]   to confess to several crimes at the request of the police, some of which we know he could
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.660]   not have committed.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.780]   That's the problem.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.740]   Some of you are thinking to yourself, "Well, none of this concerns me because I'm not guilty
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.140]   of anything and I never will be and I will never represent people who do."
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.140]   Okay.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.860]   Let's talk to you people, you innocent folks, those of you who have never committed a crime
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.060]   and never will and none of your clients will either and you wouldn't go out with a girl
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.060]   who did.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.060]   Fine.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.260]   You better not talk to the police either, okay?
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.220]   Because number three, we'll put the guilty behind us.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.220]   Forget about them.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.540]   Let's talk about innocent people.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.920]   Number three, even if your client is innocent and he denies his guilt and almost entirely
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.980]   tells the truth, odds are good he will easily get carried away and tell some little lie
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.340]   or make some little mistake that will hang him.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.340]   This is human nature.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.340]   He gets in there.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.340]   It's a stressful situation.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.500]   Imagine a perfectly innocent client.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.020]   The police say he's been guilty of a murder.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.020]   He's totally innocent, as innocent as any one of us.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.420]   So he goes in there and he meets with the police.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.140]   He says, "I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.540]   I was nowhere near there.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.540]   I didn't kill him.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.540]   I've never killed anybody.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540]   I don't have a gun.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.540]   I've never had a gun.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.540]   I've never touched a gun in my life.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.540]   I was nowhere near Virginia Beach that night."
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   That last line was a lie.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.540]   He went over the top.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.540]   He was getting carried away.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.540]   He got into this groove.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.860]   He started saying all kinds of things, almost all of them true that he knew would tend to
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.980]   exculpate himself.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.740]   Then he got carried away and just said one thing that wasn't true.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.860]   And unfortunately for him, they can prove that it wasn't true.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.140]   He may be convicted on that basis alone.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.060]   But let's say, "Oh, that's not a problem.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.620]   I'll tell my client only to tell the truth.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.620]   I've met with him.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.620]   I know he won't lie to the police.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.620]   He won't make any mistakes."
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.740]   Okay, that's still no guarantee you won't be getting into trouble.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.180]   Because even if your client is innocent and only tells the truth and doesn't say anything
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.180]   that is false.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.460]   Now, already mind you were pretty well nigh into fantasy land.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.220]   The odds of this being anybody being able to pull this off are really quite slim no
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.180]   matter how innocent they may be, but just for the same, let's pretend.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.040]   Let's assume he gives the police nothing but the truth and he is totally innocent.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.740]   He will always give the police some information that can be used to help convict him, always.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.540]   For example, suppose you tell this to the police.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.860]   Here's what your client tells the police in his denial of guilt.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.340]   "I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.340]   I didn't kill Jones.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.340]   I don't know who did.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.340]   I wasn't anywhere near that place.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.340]   I don't have a gun.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.340]   I've never owned a gun in my life.
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.340]   I don't even know how to use a gun.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.540]   Yeah, sure, I never liked the guy, but who did?
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.540]   I wouldn't kill him.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.260]   I've never hurt anybody in my life and I would never do such a thing."
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.580]   Let's suppose every word of that is true.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.700]   100% of it is true.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.700]   What will the jury hear at trial?
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.140]   Officer Brooke, was there anything about this, your interrogation, your interview with the
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.620]   suspect that made you concerned that he might be the right one?
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.620]   Yes, there was.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.140]   He confessed to me that he never liked the guy.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.980]   And then the prosecutor will put that up in big letters and he'll say, "Ladies and gentlemen
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.260]   of the jury, it's pretty clear that we've got the right guy here.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.420]   We've proven that he was in Virginia Beach that night.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.420]   That's opportunity."
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.340]   And remember, Officer Brooke admitted that after extended questioning, he was finally
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.980]   able to get the defendant to admit that he never liked the guy.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.980]   There's your motive.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980]   Motive plus opportunity.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.980]   Wham, bam.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.980]   Please.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.700]   But juries eat it up and innocent people get convicted this way sometimes.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.700]   How often?
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.620]   Hopefully not too often, but we know what happens.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.420]   The United States Supreme Court, don't take my word for this, in Ohio versus Ryan, the
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.860]   Supreme Court of the United States said, "One of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions is
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.860]   to protect innocent men who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.820]   Truthful responses of an innocent witness as well as those of a wrongdoer may provide
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.260]   the government with incriminating evidence from the speaker's own mouth."
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.580]   See, it's not just some criminal defense attorney telling you this.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.460]   Even the Supreme Court says I'm right.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.780]   Under the facts of that case, by the way, in Ohio versus Ryan, a child tragically was
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.580]   died, apparently the result of shaken baby syndrome.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.860]   Question was who had shaken this baby to death.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.300]   And one of the possible suspects was a babysitter who had spent some time with the child that
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.300]   week.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.660]   The babysitter's story was, "I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.660]   I did not kill the child.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.980]   I did not see it happen.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.140]   I don't know who shook the baby.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.140]   It was never me.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.540]   I never did anything of any violent nature to the child."
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.300]   The Ohio State Court said, "Well, you've got no Fifth Amendment privilege.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.380]   You, by your own admission, told the investigators that you've done nothing wrong, that you were
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.380]   not involved.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.980]   So, obviously, your answers can't incriminate you."
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.780]   The United States Supreme Court reversed and said, "Well, that's not true.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.700]   Even though this babysitter denies shaking the child, denies seeing the child die, denies
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:29.340]   knowing how the child died, this babysitter, by her own admission, apparently was being
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.380]   -- the government wanted to ask whether the babysitter might have been with the child
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.780]   at some point that week, during the week prior to the death.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.020]   And that answer, although by itself not sufficient to convict anybody, could help convict her.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.860]   That means she's got a Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer to the question the court
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.180]   held, because it could be used to help convict."
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:53.300]   Allman v. United States, the Supreme Court said more than 50 years ago, eerily prophetic,
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.260]   they said, "Too many Americans, even those who should be better advised, view this privilege
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.900]   as a shelter for wrongdoers.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.240]   They too readily assume that those who invoke it are either guilty of crime or commit perjury
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.620]   in claiming the privilege."
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.980]   That's not true, and it never has been.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.980]   But it gets worse.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.980]   Can it get worse?
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.980]   It can.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.220]   Number five, even if your client is innocent and only tells you the truth, and does not
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.940]   tell the police anything incriminating -- which, by the way, is almost impossible to pull this
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.940]   off.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.940]   I mean, imagine talking to the police for two, three, four hours, and somebody like
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.420]   him can't somehow manage to extract from you something that could be used to help convict
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.420]   you.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.420]   That'd be extraordinary.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   I don't think anybody's pulled it off.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.260]   But even if you could pull it off, there's still a grave chance that his answers can
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.900]   and will be used to crucify you in a court of law if the police -- no offense -- don't
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.980]   recall his testimony with 100 percent accuracy.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.660]   All right, now this brings us back to that pop quiz I warned you about.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.620]   I told you earlier, remember, it's only been a few minutes, and you weren't up all night,
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.340]   and you weren't the subject of physical duress.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.380]   You were in the relaxed setting of a classroom here.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.220]   You were given heads-up, advance notice that you would be quizzed on this.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.220]   Question.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.700]   We'll start with a couple of easy ones.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.820]   Remember that article I read to you about that -- how many people did the police find
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.340]   shot to death last night at that Ocean View apartment that I told you about?
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.340]   A?
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.020]   One, B, two, C, three, D, four.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.060]   Who says A?
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.780]   B?
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.780]   C?
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.780]   Get this.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.780]   Get that with a camera.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.780]   Move that camera around.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.300]   Look how many hands we've got there for C. Okay, D?
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   You're all wrong.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.540]   Everybody who raised their hand, everybody who raised their hand, you are the kind of
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.380]   people who should never talk to the police under any circumstances for as long as you
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.380]   live.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.380]   That's not the right answer, by the way.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.380]   If you know, raise your hand.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.380]   Yes.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.020]   >> Because he didn't state the cause of death.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.020]   >> Excellent.
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.140]   I didn't say anybody was shot.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.060]   I didn't say gun, bullet, shooting, firearms.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.220]   Didn't use any of those words.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.380]   But I don't blame you if you thought that I did.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.060]   This is the way the human mind works.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.060]   We hear things.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.060]   We fill in details.
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.980]   I said gangland-style slaying.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.300]   That may or may not imply something, but it doesn't mean that anybody was shot.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.700]   And that's the problem.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.700]   You see, even if your client is innocent and only tells the truth and doesn't tell them
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.940]   anything incriminating and his statement is videotaped, his answers can be used to crucify
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.940]   him.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.220]   You might say, "Wait, how can that happen?"
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.220]   I insisted.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.940]   In my insistence, I called the police and I said, "Look, if you want to talk to my client,
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.220]   you can talk to him, but only if you videotape the whole thing.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.340]   I don't want there to be any debate between the two of you over what happened."
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.260]   Okay, we'll videotape the whole thing.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.740]   If the police don't recall their questions with 100% accuracy, he'll be convicted on
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.740]   that statement alone.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.160]   For example, suppose a man goes to the police.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.020]   They say, "We're investigating a possible murder, a shooting."
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.580]   And the guy says, "I don't know who killed Jones, Officer Brooke, with all due respect.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.580]   It wasn't me.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.660]   I've never touched or fired a gun in my life."
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.300]   How can that help incriminate this man?
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.420]   How can that possibly be used against this man to help convict him?
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.100]   You would think it's inconceivable, but it's as easy as pie.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.500]   All the officer has to do is read the statement to the jury and then the prosecutor says,
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.180]   "Officer Brooke, was there anything about that statement that confused you or surprised
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.180]   you?"
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.340]   "Yes, there was," he says in a moment of sinister high drama in the courtroom.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.340]   And what was that?
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.680]   Officer Brooke turns to the jurors and he says, "I never said anything about a shooting.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.200]   I said we were investigating a murder.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.840]   He was the one who brought up a gun."
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   Then you turn to your client and your client says, "That's not true.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.840]   That's not true.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.920]   I remember he was the one or one of the cops.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920]   I was with them for three hours.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.400]   One of them in the car said something about they said they had a witness that I was the
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   shooter."
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   "Okay, I'll put you on the stand."
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.320]   And then your client testifies, "No, no, no.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   They did tell me shooting.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   I mentioned, they mentioned it before I said anything about a gun.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.320]   They brought it up first."
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.520]   And then the police said, "That's not true."
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520]   And now what?
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   It's your word against theirs?
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   For what?
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.980]   It's your client's life.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.660]   And police officers can very easily make a mistake like that, just as so many of you
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.200]   did just a few minutes ago about whether you recall having heard me say something about
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.020]   somebody actually being shot.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.660]   Police make mistakes, innocently, inadvertently, unintentionally, any statement, no matter
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.660]   how exculpatory it may seem on its face, can be used to crucify you all by itself if the
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.740]   police are either willing to lie, not likely, or if they just have an innocent misrecollection
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.620]   of the details as to what they did and did not tell you before you told them what you
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.780]   said.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.060]   All of these, by the way, all of these problems disappear if you take Justice Jackson's advice
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.180]   and say, "Thank you very much, officer, but no thanks."
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.700]   How about this one?
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.700]   Here we go.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.700]   Now, here's the most surprising of all.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.020]   I've saved the most surprising one for last.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.860]   Let's suppose you've got the following scenario.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.700]   Your client's thinking about talking to the police.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.880]   He acts like he says, "I've got nothing to hide.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.340]   They think that I killed somebody in Virginia Beach last night."
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.620]   And this is what your client tells you in confidence.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.580]   "I don't know who robbed that store.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.580]   It wasn't me.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.260]   In fact, I've got a pretty good alibi.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.620]   I wasn't even in Virginia Beach that night, last night.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.420]   I was four hours away visiting my mother in the Outer Banks.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.060]   Unfortunately, no, I did not pay for gas with a credit card.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.700]   I used cash, and so I've got no witnesses that can prove I was there except my word,
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.620]   and of course, mama, for what that's worth, which is nothing."
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.800]   So your client says, "So the police want to talk to me, and I want to seem cooperative,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.620]   so what I'll do is I'll tell them that I was in the Outer Banks last night."
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.600]   Now, there's nothing on its face incriminating about any of that.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.940]   Just assume, by the way, that you believe with all your doubt.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.720]   You've given your client a polygraph exam.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   You've known him for years.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   You've been going to the same Bible study for 30 years.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.740]   You know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's telling you the truth.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.740]   And he's not admitting anything.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.740]   He's not admitting motive.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.740]   He's not admitting opportunity.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.660]   He's not admitting that he was there.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.700]   How on earth could this come back to haunt us?
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.300]   How on earth could this come back to be used against us?
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   Be honest.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.340]   Raise your hand if you really think the answer to that question is, "I can't see how it could
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.340]   possibly be used against me."
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.380]   You're afraid I'll call on you, right?
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.380]   I won't call on you.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.380]   Well, you're wrong.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.380]   You're dead wrong.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.380]   You're always wrong.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.260]   Everything you say, every time you talk to the police, you will regret it.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.780]   You see, the problem is, here it is.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.500]   This is the last point.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.660]   I think it's almost over.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.660]   Even if your client is innocent and only tells the truth and doesn't tell the police anything
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.660]   incriminating and the entire interview, questions and answers are videotaped, even his truthful
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.580]   answers can be helped to use, crucify even an innocent man.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.260]   If the police, through no fault of theirs, end up in the possession of any evidence,
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.500]   even mistaken and unreliable evidence, that anything your client told them was false,
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.780]   even if in fact it was true.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.420]   Again, going back to this example from a moment ago.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.500]   Let's suppose I go ahead and I meet with the police.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.580]   I think I've got nothing to hide.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.780]   I tell them, "I was in the Outer Banks last night, officer.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.020]   How can that be used to convict me?"
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.020]   By itself, it cannot.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.060]   It cannot help at all by itself.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.900]   What if I later find out, to my horror, after I put my cards on the table, that they've
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.660]   got a witness, a girl that I went to high school with, an unimpeachable witness.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.660]   We've never been enemies.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.940]   She'd have no reason to lie.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.380]   She swears she thinks she saw me in Virginia Beach last night, a couple of blocks away
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.780]   from that store, about an hour before I was robbed.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.860]   Now, her testimony by itself isn't going to help the prosecutor.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.580]   Hell, if she's all they've got, I'll get this case thrown out before trial.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.980]   But if like an idiot, I talk to the police and I told them the truth, I told them I was
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.620]   in the Outer Banks, and now lo and behold, tragically, it turns out they've got a witness,
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.420]   a false, mistaken, confused, but sincere, incredible witness, who can testify that I
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.780]   was here in Virginia Beach, now they're likely to get a conviction.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.740]   Because what they'll do, I've just turned this cop and this woman into the government's
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.740]   star witnesses.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.460]   They'll put her, hell, they'll put Officer Bruca on to testify about how my client lied
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.260]   to him about being in the Outer Banks, and then they'll put on this girl, this girl who
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.900]   otherwise would have not even helped with their case at all, who will testify, "No,
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.900]   that's not true.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:53.900]   That was a lie.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.340]   I saw Mr. Duane's client here in Virginia, an hour before the robbery, not so far from
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.340]   the store."
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.860]   By herself, she would not have helped the government in any significant way.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.600]   But what I have just done, you see, is given them the other part of the puzzle, and now
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.700]   I'm doomed.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.740]   Don't ask them.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.080]   I close with this example.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.980]   Here we have a couple of recent celebrity examples of why it is that even people who
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.420]   admit nothing always end up denying it.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.020]   I mean, sorry, they always end up regretting it.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.420]   On the left, we have Martha Stewart.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.940]   She was the victim, the subject, of an extensive government investigation that was looking
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.100]   into the possibility that she was guilty of violations of certain federal laws, securities
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.700]   laws, fraud kinds of things.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.340]   They couldn't pin that on her, but they were able to get a conviction because she denied
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.340]   it.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.780]   She went to the police, and later, to someone at the shareholders, she said, "No, it's not
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.780]   true.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.780]   I was not guilty."
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.580]   So they charged her with lying to federal investigators, and they got a conviction,
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.900]   and she was sentenced to five months in prison.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.900]   Marion Jones, on the right side, another person who would still be out today if she had always
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.940]   taken the advice that I'm giving you now, she was asked if she had ever used steroids,
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.420]   a controlled substance.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.420]   And instead of taking the fifth, she said, "No, I never took steroids when I won those
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.420]   Olympic gold medals."
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.700]   Later on, it turned out that she was lying.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.700]   She worked out a deal.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.700]   She pled guilty.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.700]   She admitted that she was lying.
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.580]   She pleaded guilty over her strenuous, tear-filled objection, even though she has two young children,
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.580]   was just recently sentenced to prison for six months.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.740]   The guy who sold her the steroids, the pusher, he got only four months, but she got six months
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.700]   because she lied to the police and said that she did not do it.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.700]   You see the problem.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.060]   Michael Vick, who originally pled guilty, as you know, to these charges with respect
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:26.420]   to the operation of this dog combat sort of operation at his home.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.900]   At sentencing, like many other criminal defendants, even though he eventually pled guilty at sentencing,
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.140]   one of the reasons his sentence was a little harder than it might have otherwise been,
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.460]   the judge said, was because when he initially met with the police, he lied to them and said,
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.460]   "I didn't do anything.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.460]   I didn't do it.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.300]   I don't know what you're talking about."
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.420]   Even guilty people, but not only guilty people, will always end up regretting talking to the
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.300]   police.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.460]   So my advice to you, Justice Jackson was right.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.180]   Any sane, competent lawyer in his right mind will always tell every client under all circumstances,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.380]   "I don't care if you're innocent.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.540]   I don't care if it's the truth.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.100]   If it's the truth, great.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.100]   We'll tell the jury all about it.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.020]   There'll be time enough to put our cards on the table.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.420]   But before we get there, I haven't seen yet what the police got.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.860]   They may have mistaken and confused witnesses who will contradict even the truthful stuff
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.860]   that you say.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.740]   We have no way to know, no way to predict whether the information that you give them,
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.300]   even if truthful and reliable, will end up unwittingly dispelling our demise.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.960]   So keep your mouth shut.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.060]   Don't answer any questions.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.060]   Let's take the fifth.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   You'll be glad that you did.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   God bless America.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.100]   God bless the Bill of Rights and the geniuses who bequeathed it to us.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:31.540]   But now in fairness, I give equal time, or what's left of equal time, to a police officer
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.100]   who will explain to the extent to which, if any, he agrees or disagrees with anything
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.100]   I've got to say.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.620]   I have no idea to know what he's going to say, but it'll be interesting.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.500]   Here, let me give him the microphone.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.500]   Let's give him a hand.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   [applause]
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:51.780]   Officer George Brooke, the Virginia Beach Police Department.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.860]   I cannot talk that fast.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.860]   Not even interviewing.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.860]   I'm going to take the podium here, Professor.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.060]   I took notes on some of the things you said.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.620]   And everything he said was true.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.340]   And it was right, and it was correct.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.580]   And I'm just going to give you a few ideas.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:15.300]   I'm going to tell you a few examples, but first I'm going to give you a little information.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.260]   As was said earlier, I've interviewed thousands of people.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.340]   I've interviewed people with foreign police departments.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.140]   When I was in the Navy, I was in law enforcement, and I was a criminal investigator.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:28.140]   Thank God we're in the United States, because most interviews in Italy, Spain, and so forth
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.580]   start out physically.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.780]   There's no police abuse over there.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.460]   They can do pretty much what they want, any time they want, any how they want.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:40.420]   So just be aware of that and be thankful for that.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.260]   Biggest question I was asked when I first -- I am a 3L, and there's some of my classmates
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.260]   in here.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.620]   The best day is coming up, May 10th, when we get to leave.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.700]   So those of you that are applying, and I told a couple of people this, you think it's hard
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.500]   getting into law school, try getting out.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.900]   A couple of things I was asked.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.500]   How do I quit from getting speeding tickets?
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.500]   Very easy question.
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   Quit speeding.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.380]   But something Professor Duane brought up.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.060]   Are any of you guilty of anything?
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.060]   How many of you drove here today?
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.220]   Anybody go above 55 on the interstate?
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.340]   Anybody drive at home and go above 55 on the interstate?
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.740]   Because if you stay --
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:34.180]   [laughter]
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.180]   And there you go.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.740]   And people aren't inherently honest, and that's their biggest downfall.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.740]   They really are.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.460]   Or they want to tell their story.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.820]   And if you drive 55 on the interstate where it's 55, the only thing you're going to do
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.140]   is meet the person behind you because they're going to rear-end you and you're going to
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.140]   get run over.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.580]   So that's a fact.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.620]   But everybody does something that they can get in trouble for.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.580]   I can follow as a police officer when I was in uniform.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.780]   I could follow a car however long I needed to, and eventually they're going to do something
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.300]   illegal and I can pull them over.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.740]   And justifiably illegal to pull them over with.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.660]   So just be aware of that.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.980]   Don't think you're so innocent in such a thing.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.300]   When you get stopped for a traffic ticket, everyone likes to be somewhat honest.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.820]   And what's the first thing the police officer asks you?
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.300]   Do you know how fast you were going?
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.940]   If the speed limit's 35, you'll say, "Oh, 38, 40."
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.660]   Because you want to be kind of honest even though you're doing 50.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.780]   You just said 38, 40.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.500]   You just admitted to breaking the law.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.340]   You just confessed.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.620]   So they can go to court with that, with a confession that you were exceeding the speed
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.620]   limit.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.220]   Okay, so you need to think about those things.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   And when you do become defense attorneys, which I may, who knows, you need to think
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.100]   about those things for your clients.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.540]   The other thing you need to think about your clients, and this is going to seem very terse,
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.180]   people are stupid.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.060]   Your clients are stupid.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.700]   And I've had defense attorneys come up to me.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.620]   As a matter of fact, one on a motion to suppress just Tuesday, come up to me and tell me his
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.620]   client was stupid.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.980]   Okay?
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.940]   They're very straightforward.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.380]   They do foolish things.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.140]   They talk to the police.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.620]   You guys need to be aware of that.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:16.020]   Now in my past, and it wasn't exaggerated, I have interviewed thousands of people.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:22.300]   I have arrested and dealt with over 1,000 felonies, well actually more than 1,000 felonies,
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:28.020]   probably about 20, no, about 1,000 felonies, 2,500 misdemeanors, 98% of them conviction
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.700]   rate, 80% of them I don't even have to go to court.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   Why?
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.900]   Because there's confessions.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.020]   Because they confess.
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.540]   So these people have no problem.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.820]   And hardened criminals have no problem talking to the police.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.540]   People like to tell their story.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.180]   And they'll sit in that room and think about it.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180]   You're picked up by the police.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.820]   You're in a little room.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.700]   There's one chair here, there's a desk, there's another chair.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.180]   What's the thing you want the most right at that point?
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.180]   To get out of that room.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.900]   To be out of that room.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.500]   Think the police officer's shift is ending in 15 minutes.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.180]   Does the police officer want to get out of that room?
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.620]   My overtime rate's $58 an hour.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.980]   Do I want to get out of that room?
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.220]   I have no problem.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.340]   I'll stay there for 10 hours.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.620]   I'll take that $600.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.660]   So I have no motivation to want to leave.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.660]   You do.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.020]   And that's how we get you to try to talk.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.020]   I have my job.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:28.620]   My job is to develop probable cause, develop a good case, a great case is a case with a
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.820]   confession, get it to the Commonwealth's attorney so that they can prosecute the case with little
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.820]   if any effort.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.540]   And the Commonwealth attorneys love those cases, the little if any effort, because they
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.740]   come with a stack of files that high in court every day.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.000]   So they love those cases.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   That's my job.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.100]   The defense attorney's job is to hope they get to their client before I do and make sure
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.700]   they don't talk to me, no matter what.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.420]   I'll give you an example, and this will go right along with what Professor Duane was
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   putting up his examples.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.220]   I had an interview that went something like this.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.220]   Were you involved in the burglaries?
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.500]   No, I had nothing to do with them.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.500]   You didn't have anything to do with them?
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.500]   No.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   You were in a car with all this stolen stuff in it?
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.900]   You had nothing to do with it?
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.900]   No.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.900]   You knew it was there?
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.180]   Okay, now we've got possession of stolen property, felony.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.900]   But you had nothing to do with it?
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.900]   No.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.900]   So what did you need the money for?
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.740]   I had to pay some of my court costs from another thing I got in trouble for.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.940]   Oh, so he took the money from stealing the stuff.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.180]   I have enough to charge him now with burglary.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.180]   Simple as that.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:34.340]   Would you see the picture on that camera of the house with the Christmas decorations?
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.620]   This is a real case scenario.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.140]   Yeah, did you go in that house?
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:43.060]   No, I didn't go into that one.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.260]   So there's ways around it.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.740]   There's ways to get around people who try not to talk to you.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.260]   And again, as Professor Duane said, if you wanted to go and say you wanted to go into
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.420]   a boxing match, $100 if you win.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.320]   You've never boxed before.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.860]   You have to face somebody who's an Olympic boxer.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.220]   You're going to lose.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:10.340]   You're going to face somebody who's been interviewing people for, in my case, 28 years.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.980]   You're going to lose, unless you're purely innocent.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.940]   Now on the other side of it, I don't want to put anyone that's innocent in jail.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.780]   But I try not to bring anyone into the interview room that's innocent.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.180]   And there are a couple that I have let walk away because they were innocent.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.500]   Okay, the interviews.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.940]   How do we approach the interviews?
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.300]   There's a number of ways to approach interviews.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.100]   There's a number of types of people that I deal with.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.340]   First thing I do, anyone know what they get told first when they're in an interview?
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.820]   Miranda.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.820]   Miranda warning.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.500]   Okay, it's not a right.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.740]   You don't have a right to Miranda.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.740]   Those rights have always been there.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   It's called the Constitution.
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.740]   You're just teaching.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.180]   You're doing a real quick class on the Constitution for these people.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.740]   Usually they don't listen to it.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.700]   And this is the way I give my Miranda warning.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.660]   Look, I have to tell you this.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.660]   Pay attention.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.220]   Okay, they're usually sitting back or they're very attentive.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.660]   You have the right to remain silent.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.660]   You understand that?
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.660]   Yes.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.620]   Anything you say may be used against you in a court.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.940]   I don't have to say it will be.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.940]   I say it may be.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.860]   Okay, and they get that.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.660]   You have a right to an attorney.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.300]   And if you can't afford one, one may be appointed to represent you.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   Got that?
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.140]   You can decide not to talk, quit talking to me at any time and exercise these rights.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.580]   You understand that?
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.580]   Sure.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.580]   Now, before I do the primary thing that's needed with those rights, and that's to get
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:37.720]   a waiver, I say, "Now, before you say anything, let me tell you what I know."
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.420]   And over all the time I've had to put together what this individual was supposedly involved
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:46.860]   in, and I only say supposedly because Professor Duane's sitting over there, that this individual
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:52.100]   was involved in, I will tell the story that I put together and it'll be pretty close to
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.580]   what happened.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.520]   And I can see that it's pretty close to what happened, because that individual starts slumping
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:03.140]   down in their chair, they'll put their hand to their face, doing this in their mind, "Oh
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.580]   my God, I'm going to jail forever."
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.920]   Okay?
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   And I can see it.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.660]   I said, "Now that you know what I know, do you want to talk to me?"
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.200]   And why do I do that?
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.100]   Because if I didn't do that, if I said, "Do you want to talk to me?"
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.040]   They'll say no.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.540]   So I give them the time to think about, and then comes the next phrase.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.380]   "Now, before you start talking to me, let me tell you the difference between a lie and
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.180]   a truth.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.600]   If you lie to me, and I get before the judge, and I tell the judge that you were dishonest
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.460]   with me, that's just not going to make him happy.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.860]   But if I get before the judge and tell him you're honest, straightforward, willing to
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.960]   take responsibility for your actions, that is going to help you.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   That's not a lie, though.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.500]   That is true in Virginia Beach courts, it will help them.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.340]   They may not get five years, they may get three years, they're still going to prison,
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.900]   or they're still going to have a felony, but it will help them.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.100]   And then I have to determine what kind of person I have.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.660]   And there's two types.
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:05.380]   There's the one like I mentioned to you earlier, where I have to talk to them, talk to them
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:14.100]   about different things, get into their own skin, as the word is, and try and get them
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.960]   to talk to me and discuss things.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.740]   I had a sexual assault case.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.020]   I had to talk to the guy, how hot the woman was, and I understand where he was coming
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.020]   from.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.700]   And when I said that, we were buds.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.860]   And he started talking to me.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.820]   And he's still sitting in prison.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.260]   So you've got to get in there and you've got to go places.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:39.100]   The other side is, I can't try and act like that individual acts.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:45.820]   I can't try and act like what we call lovingly a hood rat.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.580]   I can't try and act and talk like him.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.940]   Because I'm an older white guy.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.900]   We don't talk like that, and that would be an insult.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.100]   And you can't insult people.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.300]   It doesn't matter who they are.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.580]   It doesn't matter where they grew up.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.460]   It doesn't matter where they're from.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.220]   You can't insult people like that.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.740]   You have to be yourself.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.980]   So you have to get into their mindset and the way they're thinking and have a discussion
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.040]   with them.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.140]   The other type of person is the one that likes to tell a story.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.500]   This young man, great man, I love him to death.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.180]   He didn't go to jail because I went to bat for him, because I felt sorry for him.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.180]   He was newlywed.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.860]   He was having money problems.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.860]   Former Marine.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.660]   I said, "Tell me what happened."
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.660]   And he told me this beautiful story about what happened.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.740]   What he had done is he had sold a piece of equipment that his ex-employer had had that
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   he had stolen.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.340]   He told me the beautiful story of what happened about him finding it on the side of the road
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.340]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.500]   And I didn't even question about him.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.260]   After he finished his whole story, very unplausible, but very beautiful story, I sat there and
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.540]   listened to it for 15 minutes.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.460]   I looked at him and I said, "You stole the stuff from your boss, didn't you?"
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.900]   "Yes, sir, I did."
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   I had nothing.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.700]   I really had nothing except the fact that he had sold it.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.780]   So there's those types of people.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.860]   And then the third type, the one who tries to be the hood, who tries to be the criminal,
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.580]   who cries like a baby when they walk into jail, but when they're on the street, they're
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.180]   as tough as rocks.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.060]   You go in there with your paperwork, you sit down, and you just start doing paperwork.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.100]   And usually I have a videotape sitting on top of it, just for measure, so they think
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.340]   I have a videotape.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.500]   And you just sit there.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.060]   Don't tell 'em, "Miranda."
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.220]   Just sit there and wait for 'em to start talking, because they will.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.220]   They want to talk.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.220]   People want to communicate.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.940]   They hate silence.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.580]   That's why when people speak, you hear, "Uh, hmm," when they're talking, because they
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.700]   need to fill that void with something.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.580]   People hate silence.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.340]   So that's the other one.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.380]   So that's another way.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.180]   So you see how there's an unlevel playing field here.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.000]   Even with the most educated individual, there's an unlevel playing field.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.500]   If you talk to the police, everything's gonna be written down.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:02.140]   If you get pulled over for a ticket, they give you the ticket, and you pull off.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.100]   Do you ever see the cop pull off right after you?
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.340]   Usually not.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:11.940]   That's because on the back of their ticket, they're writing down everything you said.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.260]   And it's gonna come into court if you go to court.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.980]   Everything that's said, I write down.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.980]   Every phone call I make has to have a listening device on it.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   Is that illegal?
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:29.380]   How many parties need to know that a phone conversation in Virginia is being recorded?
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.380]   One.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.380]   Me.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.660]   I knew it was recorded.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.300]   I get many, many confessions over the phone.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.300]   Okay, back to the people.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.300]   Yes, they're stupid.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.660]   Okay, people are stupid.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:49.460]   I had a young man who told me straight up, "I'm going to college.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.540]   I'm going to law school.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.620]   I'm too smart.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:58.940]   You'll never find out what happened."
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.100]   He was going to Tidewater Community College.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.420]   The law school love, I suppose.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:07.100]   Tidewater Community College.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.620]   He was the partner to the one who I told you the interview about just a little while ago
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.940]   where I would ask him what he needed the money for.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.940]   He was his partner.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.060]   And he was very smart.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.500]   So he thought.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.740]   He thought he was a very intelligent individual.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.100]   I ended up arresting him five times out of his house.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.780]   His mother hated me.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.780]   She liked me the first time.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.780]   She apologized.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.620]   She didn't really like me much the second time.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.580]   It got to the point where she really hated me after that.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.820]   He's doing eight years upstate.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:40.100]   He's very smart because he decided to tell me how smart he was.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.780]   And in telling me how smart he was, he let it slip that he doesn't sell stolen stuff
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.820]   to pawn shops.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:51.020]   He sells it to flea markets because they do not have to report to the state.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:55.540]   I know how to drive to a flea market just as good as anyone else and go look for stuff
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.340]   that I'm looking for.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:04.500]   So he was trying to impress me with his ability to be smarter than I was.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.740]   And he confessed.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:12.100]   So people are inherently stupid, especially criminals.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.100]   And don't get me wrong.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.020]   There are some very intelligent criminals out there.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.740]   And most of them work in really big office buildings and wear suits.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.540]   Yep.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.540]   She went to jail.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.540]   Is she hurting?
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.720]   No.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.700]   But there are some very intelligent street criminals out there as well that get other
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.860]   people to do their bidding and so forth and so on.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.460]   And people are afraid to turn on them.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.940]   But there are some very foolish people.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.300]   Just a couple other things.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:44.620]   I do a thing usually with younger people, usually between the age of -- I try not to
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:50.780]   deal too much with juveniles -- but between the age of 16 and 25 is once they've talked
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.660]   to me -- now, let's back up a little bit.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.540]   You don't need a recording in court for a statement.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:03.820]   Like Professor Duane said, it's his word against my word if he was a defendant.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.780]   Number one -- and this is the way it works.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.660]   And this is the way the real world works.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.040]   In case you guys haven't been out there, that's outside the windows out there.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:18.140]   The jury looks at a defendant sitting next to a defense attorney.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.820]   That's strike one.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.780]   Because the jury's already looking at that as that being someone who did something that
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.020]   put them in that chair.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.140]   Number two, they get a uniformed police officer up there.
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:35.060]   They get someone wearing a suit as a detective up there that is a professional witness.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.940]   That's strike two.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:40.200]   So now they have a professional witness against them.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.500]   And then if they've confessed, and that professional witness is going to sit there and read from
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.820]   his or her notes the confession, that's strike three.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.700]   Go get your orange jumpsuit.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.700]   Do not pass go.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.380]   Do not collect $200.
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.780]   So they have all those strikes against them.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:58.500]   I know you're innocent until proven guilty, but it's a jury of your peers.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.900]   And the perception is if you're sitting next to a defense attorney, you have to prove you're
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.300]   innocent.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.940]   And that's just the perception of a lot of the jury.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.900]   No matter how many jury instructions they get, they still perceive that person is a
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.740]   hoodlum, is a criminal.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.740]   And no matter how hard some defense attorneys try to put their clients in suits and have
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:23.540]   them sit up at the table, if the trial's a long trial, they fall back to their old ways.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:29.740]   And they start acting and speaking in a way that's not very good for their case.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.540]   So saying that, you don't have to have a recording.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:38.580]   My suppression hearing, a statement was trying to be suppressed because when I record a confession
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:44.180]   or an interview, because we don't do interrogations, the police, we do not do interrogations.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.060]   That's a bad, mean, Nazi kind of word, okay?
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.180]   We do interviews, okay?
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:57.020]   And you'd be amazed how much difference it makes when you use that one word versus interrogation.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:02.300]   I'll take it off the tape and I'll have my secretary put it to paper.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.220]   Immediately afterwards, I'll take that tape and I'll scan it over my magnet, throw it
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.260]   in my box so I can use it again.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.260]   I do not keep the tape.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.400]   It is not evidence.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.700]   It's not required to be evidence.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.040]   It is there.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.220]   If it's there for the court, it's just extra.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.780]   You don't have to have that, but it's really good to have.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.660]   The suppression hearing, he tried to suppress that.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.780]   After I testified, the defense counsel stood up and says, "Well, Judge, I really don't
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.780]   have anything to say."
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:32.700]   And the judge, Judge Canada, said, "Motion denied, and let's move on and go to court."
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.820]   So you don't have to have recordings.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.020]   You don't have to have videotapes.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.260]   The police videotapes, that's just extra.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.180]   If you got that police officer sitting there testifying, you don't have to have that videotape.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.780]   You got the guy that was right there to tell you what happened.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.820]   But it's always nice to have those extra things.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:51.620]   And what I do for these young people is I'll say, "Look, the person who you broke into
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.380]   their house are very upset.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.860]   They're very angry because you sold their stuff to the pawn shop.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.420]   Pawn shop stuff, sold them.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.180]   They don't get their stuff back.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.540]   They're very angry.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.780]   They want you to go to prison.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.580]   They may be very angry.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.000]   They want you to go to prison.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.460]   They may want to.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:14.460]   To lessen that, that's the start of what's commonly known as a lie because we are allowed
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.100]   to lie in interviews.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.700]   To lessen that, you might want to make them happy.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.780]   And the reason that's a lie is because when it is a felony in the Commonwealth of Virginia,
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.860]   the victim has nothing to do with the prosecution or how long the people go to prison or any
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.820]   of that kind of stuff.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.740]   We're prosecuting them, not the victim.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:36.220]   But to lessen that, what I'd like you to do is write an apology letter to the person whose
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.140]   house you broke into.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.140]   Just write it out.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.140]   Well, how do I write it?
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:45.860]   In your own words, just write, "I'm sorry for what I did," then say that, "When I broke
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.580]   into your house the other night," whatever.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.880]   They write it out.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.940]   They sign it.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.940]   I sign it as a witness.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.140]   I put the date and the time that it was written.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.500]   I give it to the Commonwealth's attorney.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:02.700]   It's entered as evidence as a written confession in the person's own handwriting.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.100]   I don't type it up again and have them sign it.
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.460]   In their handwriting, a written confession.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.780]   Is that person going to get convicted?
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:15.340]   I have never seen them not get convicted on that, on an apology letter.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.820]   So in support of Professor Duane, everything he says is right.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.460]   That's what I do.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:27.420]   Now, to take away the support, I don't try and send innocent people to jail.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.420]   That's it.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.420]   That's all I have.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   Any questions or anything like that?
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   Sir?
