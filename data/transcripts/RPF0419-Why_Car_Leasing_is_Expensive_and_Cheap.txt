[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.880]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk about car leasing.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.960]   Some people think that leasing a car is a very expensive way to operate a vehicle.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.320]   Some people think that leasing a car is a very inexpensive way to operate a vehicle.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.040]   And today I explain to you why they're both right.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.240]   And also, who is leasing the best for?
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.200]   And then perhaps most importantly, if you're in a lease and you're trying to get out of
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.840]   the lease, how do you do that in an intelligent way?
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:18.560]   What are your options?
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.440]   skills, background, education, and daily encouragement that you need to live a rich and meaningful
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.680]   life now while working on your plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.940]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.940]   This will be a fun one.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.480]   I'm going to explain to you car leasing in a very factual and straightforward way.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.520]   And I think after this show, you'll be able to understand which decision would be right
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   for you.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.120]   If you want to get personal finance people hot under the collar, just bring up the subject
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.000]   of car leasing and start arguing about it.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.040]   It seems like it's one of those things that's an elementary doctrine in the world of personal
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.080]   finance that people feel very strongly about.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.800]   But today I haven't really talked much about it on the show.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.960]   And so it's time to tackle the subject with a clear and straightforward explanation of
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   it.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.160]   And then again, as I said, all those options.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.240]   Before we do that, I want to mention one thing and then also thank many of you for something
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   very important.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.840]   Sponsor of the day today, number one, is Joshua Sheets, your host, indeed me.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.920]   And specifically what I want to make you aware of is the fact that – are you aware that
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   if you'd like to do a phone consulting call with me, that I offer that service?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.720]   I guess I'm not very good at advertising that because I get emails from time to time,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.960]   people saying, "Joshua, I didn't realize you were doing that."
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.480]   So stay right up front.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.160]   If you would like to talk to me privately, personally about your specific situation,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920]   you can book a phone call with me.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.400]   The way that works is you go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.280]   That will forward you through to a website that I use to manage those transactions.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.720]   It's a website called Clarity.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   You'll book a call with me.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.840]   We'll go back and forth and schedule it.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.880]   And the way the actual transaction will work, it's super simple.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.400]   On the site, you'll be able to book time with me.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.800]   You can select that call.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.960]   You'll put in your credit card information and you'll guess how long that you – you'll
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.920]   guess how long you're going to spend speaking to me.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.080]   Let's say that you're going to speak to me at 30 minutes.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.880]   My current billable rate is $300 an hour.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.640]   So if you do 30 minutes, your card will be charged for $150.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.900]   Then you'll be provided at the time of the call with a custom conference line.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.080]   We both get a custom conference line.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.020]   Once we dial into the call, the computer starts counting the minutes.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.360]   If our call is shorter than the 30 minutes that you guessed it would take, you'll wind
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   up with a refund.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.040]   If it's longer, you'll be charged more.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.600]   So it's a really great, really simple system.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.560]   The technology has worked flawlessly for me.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.200]   But that's – I've done dozens and dozens of these calls.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.740]   Go by RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.740]   Check out the reviews.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.520]   Many, many people have been very satisfied.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.200]   We've talked about all kinds of issues in a consulting basis.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.120]   We've talked about leasing versus buying.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.200]   We've talked about what type of car to buy.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.560]   I've had 100 percent satisfaction thus far.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.200]   We've come up with some really good solutions for people in a private format.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.480]   So if you'd like to talk to me about your personal situation, book a phone call with
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.680]   me at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.080]   Secondly today, I want to thank those of you who are supporting the show as patrons.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.240]   About 300, just under 300 of you support the show as patrons and there have been a few
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.240]   more over the weekend.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.960]   I just want to say thank you for that.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.280]   That is hugely important.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.720]   The patron program is a program that allows you to simply say, "Joshua, I appreciate
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   what you're doing.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.160]   I want to send you some money.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.320]   I believe that a worker is worthy of his wages and I also believe that a worker should always
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.880]   work before receiving his wages."
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.120]   And so that's basically the way that I approach the show here.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.920]   I try to provide this for you.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.480]   I try to give you as much information as I'm able to do it.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.440]   I do it to the very best of my ability to give you useful information and I do it all
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   for free.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.960]   It shows up for you as free and the podcast, the free format, is my primary focus.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.480]   Now if you value that and you'd like to say, "Hey, let's voluntarily engage in a transaction
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.600]   together," you can take some percentage of what I've saved you or what I've helped you
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.240]   and send it to me as a patron.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.200]   You could do as little as a buck a month, five bucks a month, ten bucks a month.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.120]   Some people do 20, 30, 50, any number that you choose.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.560]   You can do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.960]   Thank you very much for your patronage.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.040]   Now leasing.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.760]   I personally am of the opinion that there's nothing inherently wrong with leasing.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:40.320]   I get really frustrated when people use personal finance advice and they make what is subjectively
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.960]   true objectively true.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.120]   I get annoyed when people try to say, "Well, this is what you always do," when it's something
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.560]   that is clearly relative to the person.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.160]   I'm convinced there are many things in life that are absolutely objectively true.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.040]   Truth is not relative.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.520]   But most personal finance decisions are not absolutely objectively true.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.720]   That's why I steer away from things like never lease a car or always lease a car.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.000]   Rather, I look at it and say, "Let's dig it out a little bit and let's talk about why."
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.800]   Now with regard to car leasing, there's a paradox.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   The paradox is this.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.760]   Leasing a car is the most expensive way to operate a vehicle.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.600]   Leasing a car is the cheapest way to operate a vehicle.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.760]   Both of those things are true depending on your perspective.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.780]   Let me expand.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.200]   If you are going to drive a car and own a car and you're going to continually drive
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.280]   and own a car over a very long period of time, leasing a car and swapping out your leased
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.200]   car every three years or whenever your lease comes up will be the most expensive way for
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.520]   you to operate a vehicle.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:04.840]   However, if you're comparing going and buying a new car versus going and leasing a new car,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.360]   your monthly payment for the lease will be substantially less than your monthly payment
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.600]   to purchase the car.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.360]   These are both true for exactly the same reason.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.560]   When people are looking at leasing, it's important to understand are they trying to operate a
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.960]   vehicle at the lowest cost over their lifetime or are they trying to operate a vehicle at
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.720]   the lowest monthly cost for a temporary period of time?
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.880]   Now obviously, in general, to build wealth, you should be concerned with lifetime costs.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.920]   So therefore, generally, I would advise against leasing.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.520]   But there are times and situations in which somebody has to be concerned with monthly
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.840]   cost and in these cases, leasing might be an ideal solution.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.680]   I want to explain to you two basic concepts here about leasing.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.680]   First, I want to talk about depreciation as a concept and then I want to explain to you
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.620]   how leasing actually works under the terms of the contract.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.040]   Then we'll talk about the differences.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.160]   Depreciation is a word that I use a lot here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.840]   All it means is the steady loss of value over time.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.720]   In the car world, this is simple to see.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:40.280]   If I put a brand new car next to a car that's three years old and I ask you to pay the same
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:48.140]   price for both of them, you'd be a fool if you took the car that was three years old.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:55.880]   Same car, same price, you'd choose the new one for its inherent characteristics.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   Those characteristics may be things like, "Hey, it's mechanically sound because it's
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   brand new."
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.320]   It may be things like, "It smells good," or, "It's shiny."
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.600]   The point is you'd always take the new one.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:13.440]   If I put those cars on an open market, which is what we have in a car marketplace, you're
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.600]   going to pay less for the one that's been used.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:26.720]   Many people neglect to look at the severity of depreciation on cars.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.080]   It's really substantial.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.760]   We often talk about 15% a year, but it's important that you recognize that 15% a year is not
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   constant.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   It depends on the car.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.040]   Some cars depreciate more quickly.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.400]   Some cars depreciate more slowly.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.080]   I pulled up here in preparation for this show just some data, and I found this neat infographic
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.600]   from Edmunds that I'll link to in the blog post for today's show at RadicalPersonalFinance.com
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.480]   or in the notes page right up there on your mobile phone, which is how most of you are
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.200]   listening to me.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.040]   On this Edmunds page, it says that during the first five years, a car depreciates by
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.120]   15% to 25% each year.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.920]   Let's talk about what that actually means in numbers.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.480]   In this infographic, Edmunds is from 2010.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.720]   Edmunds uses the idea of a brand new Nissan 370Z.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.400]   The sticker price on that car that you would actually pay at the dealership, the true market
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.760]   value under their calculations, their data, was $29,873.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.280]   Let's call that $30,000 among friends who are trying to track numbers while they drive
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.280]   down the road.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   $30,000 car.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:42.240]   That is the actual true market value that you would pay for that brand new Nissan 370Z.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.860]   The first depreciation that you experience is the first minute that you drive it off
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.440]   the lot.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:57.820]   As soon as you buy the car and leave the car dealership, the car goes down in value immediately.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:05.740]   In this case, the Edmunds data indicates that the car goes down in value by $2,500.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:13.540]   $2,500 in the first minute after you drive it off the lot.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.860]   You lose about 11% of the car's value the moment you drive it off the lot.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:24.380]   If you're ever buying a new car, enjoy that first minute because it's a very expensive
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.500]   minute in the new car.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.940]   That means that your $30,000 car is now worth $27,000.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.540]   Now that immediate decrease in value is just simply due to the fact that the car is no
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.820]   longer new and it's no longer going to come from the new car dealership under all the
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.220]   terms of the new car.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.460]   That's unavoidable.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.620]   There's an immediate depreciation there.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:54.140]   In the first year, you have the highest amount of depreciation.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.620]   This is largely because the car is still so close to new that when somebody's considering
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.500]   buying a one-year-old car or a brand new car, they're probably going to be swayed over in
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.740]   the direction of the brand new car because the prices are going to be very similar.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.460]   But it's also due to the fact that in that first year, the car is worth the highest amount.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.060]   It drops percentage-wise substantially.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.260]   The Edmunds data indicates that at the end of one year of ownership, your car has depreciated
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.300]   in value by $5,600.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:32.420]   So it's gone from being worth $30,000 to $24,000.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:39.740]   If you add up that in here, that's down $6,000.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.180]   So at the end of one year, you've lost $6,000 of value.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.380]   In the second year, you lose another $3,600 of value.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.980]   If you own your $30,000 car for two years and you go and sell it, you can sell it for
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.180]   $20,000.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.100]   You've lost 10 grand in the first two years.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.180]   And then it continues from there.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:05.220]   In three years, in the third year, your car depreciates by $3,100.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.900]   Now let me just read you these numbers here so you can understand how depreciation works.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.380]   In the first year, you lose $5,600 of value.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.140]   In the second year, you lose $3,600 of value.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.540]   In the third year, you lose $3,100 of value.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.660]   In the fourth year, you lose $2,800 of value.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.080]   And in the fifth year, you lose $2,500 of value.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.500]   After five years, your car has gone from being worth $30,000, which is what you paid for
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.140]   it, to being worth $12,000.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.320]   You've lost 60% of the value in the first five years.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.620]   And this is normal no matter what kind of car.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.780]   Some cars depreciate a little bit less.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.940]   Some cars depreciate a lot more.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.900]   But this is a good average to look at.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:02.300]   That's a very important concept for you to grasp.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.820]   It's important to recognize that as you drive the car, as this car sits there, in addition
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.020]   to all of its normal costs, it's going down in value.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.500]   Now let's bring this back to leasing.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.220]   How does leasing fundamentally work?
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.580]   Well, let's pretend that you were going to lease a car from me.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.340]   The first thing that I have to do is go and buy the $30,000 car.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.580]   So I go and take my $30,000 and I bring it to you.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.860]   Excuse me, I go and take my $30,000 and I buy the car.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:35.820]   Now you say, "Joshua, I want to rent the car from you for..."
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.260]   Let's stick with my math because I just did this five years.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.340]   I want to rent the car from you for five years.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.760]   Pretend you were going to do a five-year lease.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.780]   Most leases are shorter in term than five years, but for the sake of my illustration,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:47.780]   let's stick with five years.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.180]   Joshua, I'm going to rent the car from you for five years.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:56.820]   Well, in this context, I know that at the end of five years, the car is going to be
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.380]   worth $12,000.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.540]   So in order to figure out how much to charge you, I know that I'm going to buy the car
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.520]   for 30 and I'm going to sell it in five years for 12, so I know I need to get $18,000 from
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.020]   you at least.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:22.060]   So I could take $18,000, divide that by 60 months and I could charge you $300 a month.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.820]   I also, however, need to recognize the fact that I'm losing the use of my money and I'm
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.140]   a businessman, so I need to make sure that I'm getting a return on my money.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.860]   So I take an interest rate.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.420]   I decide how much I'm going to charge for this, for the loss of the use of my money,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.300]   and I add that to the $300.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:52.580]   Those two things put together form the basis of our lease contract.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:58.400]   The technical term would be the principle and the interest on the depreciation.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.020]   That's the technical term for the actual transaction.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.500]   But then I've also got to recognize the fact that I'm out the additional $12,000, so then
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.940]   you had on the interest and the residual value.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.180]   How much interest am I going to earn from my $12,000?
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.740]   And then of course you would add in local sales tax and there's some additional costs
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.980]   as well, some fees such as an acquisition fee or a disposition fee at the end of the
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.940]   lease.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:31.700]   Now these things put together total the lease payment.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:39.500]   The reason leases are cheaper than buying a car is you never actually pay for the full
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.980]   price of the car under a lease.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.060]   You only pay for the cost of the depreciation.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.260]   Thus if we were to do a five-year lease on this car or if you were to do a five-year
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:58.100]   purchase plan, you would be paying a higher price per month on the five-year purchase
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:05.820]   plan because each month you have to make up a little bit more to cover that residual value.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:11.020]   You're only getting charged $20,000 under the lease whereas you're going to pay the
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.860]   full $30,000 under the purchase plan.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:21.060]   That's why leasing cars is cheaper on a monthly basis.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:26.820]   The reason it's more expensive to lease a car though on the long term is that at the
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.540]   end of the lease you don't own anything.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.940]   You can't keep driving the car.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.340]   Now back to the depreciation cost.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:41.140]   The major problem with leasing is that you're always buying brand – you're always leasing
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:47.900]   brand new cars and you're paying for the depreciation when that payment is the highest,
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.580]   when that depreciation cost is the highest.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:57.940]   For in the example here, on the first year, the car goes down in value by $5,600 in the
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.260]   first year.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:07.460]   That's a huge cost, $5,600 of depreciation in the first year.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.300]   In the second year, it's $3,600.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.840]   So all of your depreciation is front-loaded.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:20.180]   When you're leasing a car, you're operating a vehicle under the most expensive terms.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.620]   Every time you re-up your lease and go lease another one, you're constantly taking that
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.980]   depreciation at its most expensive place.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.900]   You never get to the bottom of the depreciation curve where you own the car but it only loses,
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   say, $400 of value this year.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.300]   This is a big deal, especially in our modern world when cars are generally manufactured
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.300]   with such high quality because not only are you using the depreciation at – you're
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:54.660]   paying for the depreciation when it's at its most expensive, you're also going – you
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.940]   never get anywhere near the useful life of a car.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:03.400]   If you lease a car, three-year lease, 12,000 miles a year, you're using the first most
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:10.820]   expensive 36,000 miles when a modern automobile can easily have an expected duty cycle of
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.380]   200,000 miles without even trying.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.920]   Maybe much longer if you want to keep it.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:24.300]   So you're always operating in this very expensive place.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:31.460]   That's why it's generally such a bad move to operate a car using a lease.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.300]   Now are there people for whom leasing is really great for?
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.200]   I think so.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.100]   The very best person for whom leasing is great is somebody who has lots of money, wants to
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.720]   always be driving a new or practically new vehicle and never wants to deal with the hassle
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.700]   of buying and selling their own vehicle.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.660]   They just simply – the loss of value under the terms of their car lease is insignificant
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.320]   in their financial life.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.540]   They can lose six grand in that first year or 16 grand depending on the car and it doesn't
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.820]   matter to them at all because they have so much money in other places.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.980]   I think leasing makes a lot of sense there.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.780]   It works well.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:19.900]   I also think leasing might make sense in some circumstances where it's important for the
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:25.060]   image of the person, let's say the image of their business, their image as a professional,
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:32.140]   to be able to drive a fancy enough car to fit in in their profession when they don't
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:36.180]   have enough money to actually be able to afford it.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.540]   The key is to recognize that this had better be a temporary situation.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.500]   It's also important to recognize that most people who tell themselves that they need
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.740]   a nice car for their profession are fooling themselves.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.620]   Image does matter.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.720]   Presentation does matter.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.820]   But the vast majority of people who tell themselves, "Oh, I need a nice car for my image,"
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.980]   don't.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.460]   But there are a few people who do.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:08.740]   Well, in that case, if you need the lowest monthly payment, okay.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.220]   It can work.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.860]   But hopefully it's temporary.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.940]   There are a few other things.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.180]   Hopefully you drive very small amounts.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.660]   You need to drive less than 15,000 miles a year.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.500]   There's possibly a small business arbitrage opportunity where if you're paying out of
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.900]   a business, perhaps you can consider the lease.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.740]   You can speak to your tax advisor for that.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.100]   I don't want to get into the details of that at the moment.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.900]   But that's who leasing is good for.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.460]   But if you're somebody who's looking to actually get the most value for your money, somebody
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:49.660]   who's actually looking to build wealth, in order to do that, you've got to stop stupid
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:55.580]   outflows of money and hemorrhaging money on depreciation on new vehicles when there's
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:02.540]   no practical value to them as a good place to start.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.820]   Don't start hemorrhaging.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.300]   Start by stopping the hemorrhaging.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.460]   Hopefully I got that right.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.220]   One of the simplest ways to lower the cost of transportation is to keep vehicles for
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.740]   a long time.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:22.300]   And operating a car in this very high expensive bracket is a bad idea.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.180]   It's a bad idea until you're rich.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:30.700]   Here's what's the worst thing about leasing.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.460]   Because the lease payment, saying this was the worst thing was too strong.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.860]   Here's another bad thing about leasing.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.940]   Because the lease payment is less than the purchase payment, it's very easy to fool yourself
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:49.820]   into upgrading your choice of vehicle when you're standing there in the car dealership.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.780]   Yes, you can go and lease the Toyota Corolla for $130 a month.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.500]   But you know what?
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.140]   If you move up to the Camry, it's only $155.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.820]   If you move up to the 4Runner, it's only $280.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.160]   I can afford $280.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.700]   After all, the 4Runner is a lot better, and I might need four-wheel drive this winter.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.500]   And you can just go marching right up from there.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.100]   Because the lease payment is smaller, you wind up in too much car, too expensive of
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:26.180]   a car, where it's simply unnecessary.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.940]   If you're interested in being wealthy, if you're interested in making good financial
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:40.300]   decision, if you are not yet rich, don't lease cars.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.300]   Buy them.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.220]   Now, in this case, if you're in that category, meaning you're interested in becoming wealthy,
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:52.860]   you want to make good financial decisions, and you're not yet rich, under this calculation,
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.660]   you shouldn't even be considering a new vehicle.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:01.740]   You should be spending the absolute minimum to get the transportation that you need, and
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.260]   then funneling a maximum of your money into investments.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.100]   That is an unbreakable mathematical law.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:18.060]   If you're losing $5,000 per year, because you're always leasing a car at its most expensive
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.900]   point of operation, but yet you're over here funding an investment account at $5,000 a
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:32.140]   year, you're spinning your wheels.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.160]   You could dramatically improve the trajectory of your wealth building if you simply stop
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:43.300]   the $5,000 hemorrhage and increase the investments.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.780]   If you're not, most people aren't investing.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.380]   If you can do both, double it up.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:53.980]   Save 10 grand, you'll get financially free twice as fast.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.980]   That's it.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.300]   That's as simple as it gets with regard to leasing.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:03.660]   Now, let's talk about how to get out of a lease.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.940]   If you're stuck in a lease and you're trying to get out, you have very few options, and
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.240]   none of them are great.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:18.120]   The first thing to recognize is that you're stuck because you moved too fast, or you wound
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.420]   up in a situation, or your circumstances may have changed.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.900]   I don't want to be too harsh.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.900]   There could be reasons why you did this.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.100]   But if you want to get out of a lease, it's very difficult.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.580]   There are a few basic options that you can do.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.500]   Let's go from the worst to the best.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.020]   The worst thing to do, I guess, is just to stop paying for it, in which case it'll be
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.020]   repossessed.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.340]   Your lease will be repossessed.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.540]   You'll be sued for the difference.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.020]   Your credit will be affected deeply.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.560]   That's not a good plan.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.580]   You could do what they call a voluntary repossession, which means drive it to the lot and leave it
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.580]   there.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:55.140]   In that case, the same basically thing happens where you get marked with a repossession.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.900]   One of the things that you want to do if you find yourself in this situation is you want
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.020]   to investigate the possibility of taking the car back.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.660]   The way that you do that is you call the leasing company and find out what the early return
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.580]   payoff amount is.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.460]   You might be able to look and scratch around and find enough money to put with it in order
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.100]   to return the car.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.860]   Sometimes you can maybe negotiate where they'll sell the vehicle and then you'll be able to
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.860]   put up the difference with it.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.940]   But basically, you're trying to figure out how much money you're going to owe to get
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.700]   out of this.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.900]   If you return the car, they'll often allow you to do that if you roll the payments over
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.180]   into a new lease.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.740]   This is a bad thing to do if you're trying to get out of a lease.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.260]   It's only in an emergency situation where you have a financing emergency that you would
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.260]   consider this.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.780]   The reason it's bad because you're constantly rolling all those payments over and you're
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.300]   building up worse and worse, it's called negative equity, which means you owe way more than
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.700]   a vehicle is worth.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.700]   Sometimes you can return the vehicle if you read your contract.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.100]   You can always return the vehicle and pay all the penalties, but you're going to wind
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.260]   up paying a big termination fee, an early termination fee, and you're going to pay
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.580]   out the remaining depreciation of the vehicle, which you no longer have the opportunity to
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.580]   use.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.380]   The leasing company turns around.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.540]   They sell the car at auction and they'll reduce the money that you owe them based upon
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.220]   the money that they received at auction.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:29.820]   That's a bad thing to do because the car is going to sell at auction lower than what you
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.580]   could get in the private market most likely.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.620]   It's almost always better to try to sell the car yourself.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:40.660]   This is another good option, just to simply sell the car.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.900]   You can always buy the vehicle that you're driving from the leasing company anytime you
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   want.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.140]   Again, that's called an early buyout.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.860]   In your leasing contract, there's a buyout at the end of the lease term, but you can
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.700]   get the number for the early buyout.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.000]   Call the leasing company.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.260]   Find out what the early buyout or the payoff amount is of the vehicle.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.620]   Call the lease company directly.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.500]   The lease company is the one that owns it, not a dealer.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.980]   That's why I don't call the dealer.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.840]   Just call the leasing company.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.220]   That amount will include some fees.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.820]   It'll have an early termination fee.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.500]   It's usually $200 to $500.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.620]   It'll also include in it all of the remaining depreciation cost for the lease payments that
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.740]   you haven't made so far.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:29.700]   Usually, the value of the car will be less than the early payoff amount.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:37.800]   So perhaps the early payoff amount is $20,000, but your car is only worth $16,000.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.780]   So in that case, probably your best thing to do, you're going to have to figure out
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.400]   how to come up with a difference.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.960]   If you paid a lot of money down on the car in the beginning or if this is a car that
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:53.020]   has a strong secondary market, perhaps the damage won't be so bad.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.080]   You won't know until you shop the market, find out what the secondary market, find out
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.880]   what you could sell it for in the used market, and find out what the payout amount is.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.800]   Remember, in a lease, there's always going to be a down payment.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.040]   And if there's a down payment, not always, often there's a down payment.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.600]   All that down payment does is it lowers the monthly payments.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.160]   If you don't have the down payment, the monthly payments are higher.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.340]   It's just a little accounting trick.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.780]   So in terms of where you are right now, it will depend on how much of a down payment,
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.320]   what the actual value is of the car.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:35.180]   If you can sell the car in the secondary market and come up with enough money from the sale
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:43.220]   and/or from your pocket to pay off the early payoff amount, you can get out of the lease.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:48.420]   That's going to be one of your best options to do.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.860]   Big challenge here in the private market is generally where you're going to be able to
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.960]   get a higher amount.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.620]   You could also do the same thing, of course, trade it into a dealer.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.980]   You could ask different dealers for trade-in amounts and you could use those figures as
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.700]   well, and that's good.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.100]   At least you can go to just about any dealer and get a firm offer on a firm price, whereas
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.280]   in the secondary market, you're putting it on Craigslist, putting out ads, putting it
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.620]   on AutoTrader, et cetera.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.660]   You don't know until the actual sale is consummated.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.020]   One of the problems with selling these leased cars in the secondary market would be the
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:25.260]   age of the vehicle, which might lead to a thin market.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:30.340]   If you're selling a leased car private party, you're usually selling a leased car that is
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.340]   pretty new.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.100]   It's maybe a year old, two years old, three years old.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.780]   Now, what's the demand for this type of vehicle?
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.660]   Most people that are shopping in the used market are probably shopping for vehicles
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.500]   that are a lower price point than one that's almost new.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.740]   A couple of reasons.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.620]   If you're going to go and spend, let's say you bought a car for $30,000, if you're going
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:31:01.180]   to spend $24,000 and get a car that someone else has had, or spend $30,000 for a brand
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.460]   new car, it's only a very small percentage of the population that's going to make that
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.900]   financially wise decision.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.940]   Most people are going to say, "Let me just go ahead and buy it new."
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:19.840]   Not a lot of people come up with cash payments for almost new cars.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.840]   Most people need financing.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.940]   Of course, any buyer could arrange their own financing.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.620]   They could arrange their own financing with their bank, but most people don't do that.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:34.060]   Most people go and they get financing from the car dealership.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.600]   The type of person that you'd like to sell the car to, there aren't many of them in that
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.500]   secondary market at that level.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:48.620]   Craigslist is not crawling with people who are ready to plunk down $30,000 cash for a
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.620]   one or two year old car.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.660]   It's a real challenge.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.660]   The people who do have the cash to buy the car from you on Craigslist are going to want
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.820]   a deal.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.820]   That's why they're there.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.820]   They're smart people.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.420]   That's who you should be, is going and buying those cars at a discount and just offering
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.940]   cash to move quickly.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.940]   The resale market in the private market for this type of car that's a year, two years,
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.380]   three years old can be very thin, especially if you can't provide financing.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.380]   Is it possible?
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.340]   It's possible, but the market is thin.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.020]   It's a real challenge.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.340]   That is a really good option.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:29.060]   Sell the car and you got to get enough money from the sale of the car plus the money that
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.920]   you may have to put with it and buy the car out from the lease company.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.700]   That will get you out under the terms of the contract and you can be out from under the
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.260]   lease.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.940]   Finally, there is another good option that has come out.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.860]   This is called lease trading or lease transferring.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.660]   There are three websites, at least three.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.260]   I'm sure there are more too, but the three websites.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.900]   One is SwapALease.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:57.360]   One is Leastrading.com and another is Leastrade.com.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.140]   These websites exist to help people just simply swap leases.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.480]   You get the SwapALease idea.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.780]   These work pretty well from all of my research.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.340]   I haven't engaged in one of these transactions personally, but I have looked at them.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:17.220]   If you're looking to pick up a lease of a car or if you're looking to get out from underneath
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.700]   your own lease, you should really consider this.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:26.620]   If I were stuck in that position where I said earlier, one of the places of leasing a car,
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.100]   if I were in a position where I just wanted to drive a fancy car, trade it out for a few
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.420]   years, I'd just go to the dealership and do it there.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.500]   But if I were in that position where I had a cash flow problem and I'm trying to figure
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:43.300]   out how can I lease a car as cheaply as possible in order to give the transportation that I
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:49.380]   need, I would go to SwapALease and I would try to get it from there.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:56.440]   Because here, I may be able to get into somebody else's lease at a cheaper price and still
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.540]   diminish the amount of money that I have to come out of pocket with.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.860]   One of the big benefits of doing something on, again, a lease swapping or lease trading
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:13.740]   side, is that the buyer of the lease doesn't have to pay a lot of the upfront expenses
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.740]   that you, if you're selling your lease, that you had to pay.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.420]   They don't have to pay the down payment.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.940]   That can be a big benefit.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.140]   So if you're looking to buy a lease, get into one, this can work really well.
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:32.660]   Now you, of course, need to check your contract to see if this is permitted.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.940]   Most leasing companies will allow you to transfer the lease to another person.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:41.020]   You have to be careful because in many cases or most cases, you're still going to be on
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.980]   the contract and liable if the other person stops making payments and then you're going
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.540]   to have to pay a transfer fee to transfer the lease.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:54.300]   But this is a really good market that has emerged to solve the problem.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:59.180]   There are other interesting things about this market where buyers and sellers of leases
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:05.540]   are exploiting the terms of the contract in order to get the lease gone or to get a lease.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.940]   So for example, if you really want to get out of the lease, depending on the amount
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.740]   of miles remaining that you have and the money that you actually put down, you might find
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:19.180]   yourself in a position where you want to offer an incentive and you want to offer an incentive
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.860]   where you'll be able to pay the person, where they'll be able to get the lease for less
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:28.380]   than you have to pay for it so that you can get rid of it.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.300]   Let's say that you owe $500 a month on the lease and you just can't make that.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.980]   Well, somebody might be willing to come up and you can put an incentive on there of $100
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.820]   a month and somebody will pick that lease up for 400 bucks.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.340]   It's not perfect for you.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.260]   Of course, you'd like to get out of it completely, but it might solve the financial problem.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.180]   It gets you out from underneath the $500 payment.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:52.020]   You can make the $100 payment, but it gets you out from underneath the $500 payment.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.940]   So this can be something that you should really investigate.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.940]   Forgive me, I made a mistake.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:57.980]   I misread my notes.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.380]   The two websites that I've looked at, I think there are more too, but I think these are
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.980]   two of the big ones, are leasetrader.com and swapalease.com.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:12.560]   So those are the two that you want to check out, leasetrader.com and swapalease.com.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.300]   Those are the basic options for getting out of the lease.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.340]   You always have to weigh, is this the best thing to do or is this not the best thing
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.340]   to do?
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.940]   There's going to be a cost involved anyway and you have to run the actual numbers of
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.980]   your circumstance as always.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.420]   Read your contract, call the dealer, get the information and then sit down and do some
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.060]   calculations and see if some of these options.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.260]   If you can sell the car in the secondary market, come up with the cash.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.060]   If you have the cash and you come up with it, that can work out well.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:49.200]   If you don't have the cash, you'll end up trading the lease out or you might just wind
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.540]   up in this position where you've got to pay it out.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.860]   But while you're paying it out, as you get to the end of the lease term, make sure that
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:37:02.980]   you're saving the money in order to be able to buy your next car, hopefully for cash.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:07.340]   That way you don't have to deal with this challenge of payments.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.460]   In the meantime, you can help educate other people so they don't get stuck in car leases
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.940]   unless they're getting rich and they just want to swap their cars out all the time.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.940]   That's it for the show.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.020]   I hope this has been helpful to you.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.980]   It's a hot topic in the world of personal finance.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.300]   Hope these advice is useful.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.300]   It's really simple concepts.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:30.540]   It often frustrates me when I hear people say it is to say you've got to take it on
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:38.660]   some sort of blind faith where it's don't lease vehicles instead of explaining how it
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.660]   actually works.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.460]   So hopefully now that I've explained how it actually works that you find that a little
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.020]   bit useful and more helpful.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.020]   That's it for today's show.

[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.060]   And so as I work on that, I need some good demographic data.

[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.020]   I don't care.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.020]   It doesn't matter to me.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.020]   I'm not doing anything with the list.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.020]   It's just there in the survey software.
