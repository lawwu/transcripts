[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   When you're an American Express Platinum Card member, the trip starts in the Centurion lounge.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.840]   And as you enjoy the chef's local dish, you think what will be on the menu for your layover?
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.080]   See how to elevate your travel at AmericanExpress.com/with-amex.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.220]   Don't live life without it.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.980]   Terms apply.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.480]   It's Friday and today that means live Q&A.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:38.100]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.740]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.460]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.820]   My name is Joshua, I am your host, and I welcome you to today's Friday Q&A call.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.420]   These Q&A calls work just like Call & Talk Radio does.
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.240]   I post a link to the recording software for patrons of the show.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.900]   Those who sign up to support the show on Patreon.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.460]   They call in and we talk about whatever is on their minds.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.620]   If you would like to join me on one of these Friday Q&A calls, the best way to do it is
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.060]   go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.180]   Sign up to support the show there.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.940]   And then whenever I do one of these, which is any Friday that I can be in front of a
[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.460]   computer and in front of an internet connection, whenever I do one of these, you'll get
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.540]   notifications about the Q&A call and you can sign in and join.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.100]   So I'd love to have you join me for the next Q&A call.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.460]   Hope you will consider doing that.
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.580]   Quick note, this is probably one of your easiest and cheapest ways to ask me any
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.020]   questions that you want to talk about.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140]   Certainly it's not entirely anonymous.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.020]   You give me a name and there's a voice, I guess, of you on the show.
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.540]   But beyond that, I don't give me any name you want and use any voice that you want.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.500]   But if you want to talk about something, it's probably one of your least expensive ways
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.780]   to engage in consulting calls with me.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.700]   So I just encourage you, if you're a money saving person, you want to talk with me, go
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.020]   to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.500]   I really think that's one of your best options.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.580]   We begin with Jeff in North Carolina.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.380]   Jeff, welcome to the show.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.380]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740]   Thanks, Josh.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.220]   Just a couple of quick questions for you, mostly related to my current housing
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.180]   situation.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.620]   But first of all, just appreciate everything you do.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.100]   Been listening to you for a couple of years and definitely got a lot of value out of
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.860]   everything you're teaching, especially from the podcast, but also through some of the
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.380]   courses. So definitely appreciate everything that you do.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.300]   Thank you. My pleasure.
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.780]   Sure. So first question related to my current housing situation, I'm in sort of a
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.900]   traditional lease.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.540]   However, I did leave a kind of cushy corporate job about three weeks ago, but kind of
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.420]   within that time, but also previously been pretty inspired by some of the things from
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.860]   like early retirement extreme and also kind of some of the freedom things that you've
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.700]   been espousing on the show lately.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.100]   And basically where I'm at is I have a buyout clause in my lease for my apartment.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.740]   And basically what that means is with basically 60 days notice and two months rent, I'd
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.980]   be able to get out of the lease contract.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.780]   And kind of on the extreme end of things, I was entertaining the idea of moving into my
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.460]   Prius, doing a little bit of stealth camping in the time being till I find the next best
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.860]   thing.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.380]   I like it.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.180]   Very nice.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.860]   Absolutely.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.860]   So kind of wanted to get your thoughts on obviously, and I know you've kind of mentioned
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.940]   previously, you know, doing, you know, sort of whether it be van life, life on the road.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.780]   And also I know you've mentioned that Prius is for camping previously.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.540]   So any cool advice you may have, just especially since you spent a lot of last year on
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.780]   the road, would appreciate any advice you have.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.900]   So any additional details I can give you around the lease piece for your thoughts?
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.780]   Yes.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.580]   But I would say I don't imagine that there's another financial planner in the world who
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.740]   has spent, let's see, I've probably spent between two to three weeks.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.820]   So 14, somewhere between 14 and 21 days camping in a Prius on the road, stealth camping,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.980]   camping all over the place.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.420]   So I cannot imagine that there's another financial advisor in the world, or at least a
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.660]   credentialed financial advisor in the world who can say that.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.420]   If there is, you write to me and let me know.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.820]   But I got to imagine I'm the only person in the world that would have any insight
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.380]   whatsoever on this question from a personal experience.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.420]   Tell me more about kind of what you envision with your trip and what you envision doing.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.620]   A little bit about the dream or the plan.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.180]   Sure.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.260]   I mean, I don't, I mean, I'm not in a great financial situation at the moment.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.300]   I have, I did have about, I was able to muster together about 10 grand after I left
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.900]   that job.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.500]   So I have a decent cushion.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   So you have 10 grand in the bank right now?
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.740]   Correct.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.940]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.820]   And I have about, about 60 grand in consumer debt.
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.020]   I have been able to kind of, you know, control that a little bit.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.740]   I put one of the larger personal loans on like a forbearance or whatever they call it.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.740]   So it's not like a huge issue for, till I find, you know, some better income.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.820]   So I guess what I'm getting at is the goal isn't necessarily so much to kind of get out
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.460]   and see the world as opposed to just kind of have a, a practical way of cutting my
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.900]   housing costs pretty significantly, just based on the fact that I already have the
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.540]   Prius.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.340]   And I mean, but I would also love to do, you know, some of those things if there is
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.540]   an excuse to do so.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.620]   So that's, I just wanted to say that that's not really the main focus, but it would be
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.140]   cool to do it as well.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.260]   Do you have an idea of a job that you'd like to take or, or a business you'd like to
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.220]   start or some way to generate income at the moment?
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.020]   My background is in kind of like sharing economy.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.300]   I've done some work.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.660]   I worked for a company that got acquired by Grubhub.
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.980]   You know, so sort of the management of independent contractors is sort of my, my
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.620]   background.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.420]   And I would, you know, definitely be open to keeping up with that space just because
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.540]   it is pretty interesting.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.420]   But, you know, definitely leery of, would prefer something that's as remote as
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.700]   possible, maybe a little travel required.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.740]   But, you know, trying to stay out of the office sort of nine to five type environment
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.620]   where I came from, cause that was not great just because with a lot of my other
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.940]   previous roles, I had been pretty flexible with remote or travel type of
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.620]   arrangements.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.540]   So you got 10 grand in the bank, about $60,000 of debt.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.660]   Do you have any other, other than I guess the car, do you have any other really
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.780]   significant assets that they're investment assets, other real estate that you own?
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.940]   Nope.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.540]   Okay.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.500]   And what were you earning before you left the job?
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.420]   A hundred K.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.980]   Okay.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.980]   Do you think that it's realistic that you could get another position in short order
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.540]   earning six figures?
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:31.700]   I think short order, no, but definitely potentially, you know, 90 days maybe.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.420]   But, you know, I mean, if I were to cut my housing costs basically to the bone, I
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.180]   could definitely, you know, you know, look for something, you know, 60 to 75 K would
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.860]   certainly be very doable for a solid lifestyle.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.780]   And how much is your monthly rent currently?
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.140]   $1,100.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.420]   So to break the lease, you'd be on the hook for about $2,200.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.020]   Correct.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.300]   However, just to kind of make that a little bit more clear, there would be 60 days
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:10.260]   notice, so it would be sort of like paying almost four months, but it would be sort of
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.500]   that 22 stroke after the 60 days.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.380]   Okay.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.420]   So, all right.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.340]   So what you're saying is you would give them 60 days notice today, and then you
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.460]   would pay $1,100, $1,100, and then at the end of 60 days, then you owe $2,200.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.380]   So basically it's about $4,400 that you're on the hook for right now.
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.580]   Right.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.100]   Okay.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.340]   How much time is left on the lease if you see it to fruition?
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.980]   December.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.940]   So a while.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.660]   Okay.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.260]   Well, obviously that's a big chunk of money.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:48.260]   And so before you do that, do you, have you read your contract to see if you have a
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.900]   clause against subletting?
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:56.060]   I'm not allowed to sublet, but the other sort of easier option that I had entertained
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.740]   was you can do like a lease takeover.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.420]   So, you know, just go on Craigslist and, you know, see if somebody would, you know,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.580]   we'll be looking for that sort of duration and, you know, that price range kind of
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:09.900]   thing.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.940]   So that's something else I had thought about, but the Maya would be the worst case
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.340]   scenario.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.220]   So let's talk about living in your car.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.340]   It ain't great.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.100]   And I think that's the first place to start with.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.340]   It's great if you're doing something that you're excited about.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.940]   So it's great if you're traveling, in my opinion.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.620]   It's great if you're engaging in some adventure that you want to do.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.580]   But if you're just staying in your hometown and you happen to be sleeping in your car
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   at the local Walmart, that's not great.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.660]   And it starts to wear on you over time.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.420]   You start to feel a little bit like you're kind of on the edge of society just because
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.300]   of, and it's not necessarily due to anyone else's perspective.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.820]   You know, does anybody know if you're even staying in your car?
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.580]   Well, of course, if they see you when you're parking at night, if you're, we're
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.380]   depending on where you're actually parking, certainly.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:11.260]   But it's more a matter of, it's not normal to be out and about in society at all hours
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.740]   of the day.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:18.460]   The normal situation is you're either in an office or you're at home working or you're
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.420]   at home in the privacy of your own walls.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.420]   And so what wears on you over time is the feeling of, well, I'm kind of just always
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.980]   visible.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.500]   You're never not visible to other people.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.220]   And so you can never really relax.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.780]   Now, that didn't come out right.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.140]   You can relax, but it's just kind of weird.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.180]   When you've been accustomed to the normal lifestyle, it's a little bit weird to be all
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.580]   of a sudden living in a car.
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.540]   Because what you'll find is, yes, can you sit in your car?
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.020]   Yes.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.980]   And what you would do is you would get a comfortable chair and you would, you know,
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.060]   go to the local park and you would find some spots to hang out in.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:57.060]   You would find some cafes to work in.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.860]   You might go and start working at the local library with your laptop.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:06.700]   But at the end of the day, it's still easy to feel this sense of unrootedness, this sense
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.740]   of just disconnectedness.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:17.780]   And so the first thing that I would say is that I think it's better to, if you're going
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.380]   to live in your car, it's better to have a purpose that's beyond just simply, well, I'm
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.620]   doing this to save money.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.060]   In a dire circumstance, can you do it?
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.900]   Yes, you can.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.540]   But the reality is I don't think you're in a dire circumstance.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.100]   You could, you have $10,000 in the bank, you could pay your rent and cover your
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.420]   expenses for a few months and then get another job and then pick back up where
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.060]   things were.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.860]   And since you could do that, I think that you should consider doing that and have the
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.700]   living in your car thing as almost a thing of last resort rather than going ahead with
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.860]   a plan right away.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:59.140]   Now, where I would change on that is if living in the car would allow you to do
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.140]   something that you were truly excited about.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.180]   And by the way, let me ask, what part of the country are you living in?
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.060]   I'm in the Southeast.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.660]   In the Southeast, OK.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.860]   So it just, it depends.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.260]   There's a big difference between the Southeast versus the West versus the
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.460]   Northeast in terms of how easy it is to do it.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:25.700]   I camped in my car in the Northeast where I was hiding in a local park, sleeping at
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:25.980]   night.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.500]   And it's just, it's hard because there's not nearly as many places to go and things
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:29.900]   to do.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.860]   Now, if you're in a place where there's abundant government land, BLM land, things
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.860]   like that, where you can park and camp for free.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.740]   If you're in a place where it's easy to do it at Walmarts and things like that, it's
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.980]   a lot easier than if you're in the middle of a big city in the Northeast.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.140]   So that needs to come into play as well.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.940]   So what I would say is the first thing you should do is if you're going to do it,
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.540]   think about doing it at least in the context of a trip.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.940]   Because if you just decide today I'm going to go and camp in my car in your
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.660]   hometown, I think that by the end of the week you'll be back home.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.140]   Whereas if you're on a trip, okay, well, now there's something you're seeing
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.340]   something new, you're doing something new, you're meeting interesting new people.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.260]   And it's a little bit more, you have more of a reason for doing it.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.740]   That's just my experience.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.100]   If I were going to live in a car, if I were going to travel, traveling in a Prius
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   is adequate and you get great benefit of being, having such great gas mileage that
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:30.180]   you can travel very comfortably and travel long distances as a single man.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.340]   But if I were going to live in a car, I would not choose a Prius to live in
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.060]   because you just don't have anywhere to really relax.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.700]   And so at the very least, if I were in a situation at the very least, I would buy,
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.020]   you know, a pickup and a truck camper or at least a van, something like that,
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.140]   where you can be in the vehicle and you can do things like cook in the vehicle,
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.340]   et cetera, without it being so weird and strange as a Prius.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.900]   So that would be, that would be the first thought.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.700]   Now, second thing would be if you have a clear goal of what you're going to, yes,
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.300]   the least comes into account.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.340]   And so the first thing I would do today is I would start, if you're allowed to
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.980]   advertise for somebody to take over the lease, the first thing I would do today
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.340]   is I would start advertising for someone to take over the lease.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.300]   There's no reason why you can't advertise for that.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.660]   And you might find somebody willing, willing to do that.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.780]   Even if you have to pay a little bit of money, let's say that your lease is
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:26.420]   1100 and you tell someone I'll lease it to you for 900 and I'll make up $200.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.700]   That of course would save you a lot of money as opposed to the $4,400.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.660]   I would also look around my network and see, do I have any, you know, homeless
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.580]   friends or, you know, a brother or someone like that who could just come
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.860]   and crash with me on the couch?
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.700]   Is it technically subletting?
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.020]   It's kind of one of those gray areas, maybe technically, but if they, if you
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.940]   found someone that was willing to pay you $500 a month to stay in your place,
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:55.500]   then I think that you would find, you would find time, you would find it worth
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.580]   the effort to, you would find it worth the effort to stay in the apartment.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:06.060]   Um, and then as far as the next step, I think the biggest thing is going to be,
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.020]   what are you going to do?
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.180]   Um, and that's, and going back to the car thing to try and answer your question.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.300]   If you're going to get a job, I recommend you don't do the car thing.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.380]   I recommend you go ahead and get a job because when you do the car thing, you'll,
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.980]   you'll feel like you're a little bit on the edge of society.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.460]   It's very hard to stay feeling normal.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.580]   Even if you get a gym membership and you shower at the gym and you get dressed,
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.300]   it just causes you to feel a little bit weird and it weighs on you and you're
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.500]   not at your best.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.660]   Uh, and I've even learned this myself with regard to staying in places like
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.500]   cheap hotels.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.580]   When I was younger and broker, I was always staying at whatever place was the
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.420]   cheapest.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.380]   And I didn't understand why people would pay lots of money for a night in a hotel
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.020]   in order to, um, when they could buy something cheaper.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.860]   Yeah, I got that.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.660]   It was nicer, but I, I'm, I'm not to me.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.820]   Niceness is, is not that big of a deal.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.740]   I just don't have to have fancy luxury all the time.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.380]   And I figured, well, the cheap places is, uh, is as good as anything.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.460]   So why not save the money?
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.940]   Uh, and then what I learned is how I started to measure my productivity and my
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.940]   ability to actually get results.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.380]   And I discovered that I really needed, uh,
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.820]   that I wasn't as productive in the cheap place that if I didn't have a good table
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.940]   and a good chair in my room, I couldn't get as much work done.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.940]   And I remember distinctly, I was in, I was in Canada on a business trip and I was,
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.900]   uh, this was a few years ago and I was staying at a, I'd gotten a cheap hotel,
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.620]   but I didn't have, the desk was tiny and I didn't really have a place to set up
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.180]   and work and I lost a day of work.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.260]   And I just said, that's it.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.220]   I'm never doing this again from now on.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.900]   Uh, if I'm going to travel, I'm going to stay in a proper business class hotel
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.180]   where I have a proper desk to work at because I'm just not as productive
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.340]   when I go to a coffee shop.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.820]   I'm not as productive when I don't have a desk and a chair and an outlet and
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.140]   kind of the simple things.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.820]   And the key is for me to be able to produce and to work.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:07.780]   And so over the years I've stopped my, you know, extremely frugal ways just
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.540]   because I've recognized that if I, if I indulge those extremely frugal ways,
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.580]   yeah, I don't spend much, but I also don't produce anything and I don't make much.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:22.100]   And so it's more important for me to be productive and my ability to produce
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.380]   value in the marketplace is far, far higher than what it costs me to stay at
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.540]   a business class hotel at, you know, $150 a night or whatever.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.580]   And so it's basically that same concept.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:40.060]   Um, but to the extreme, to the max with regard to staying in your car, is it a
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.980]   good way to go on an adventure on the cheap?
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.780]   Yes.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.980]   But not if you're expecting anything out of yourself as far as to produce
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.660]   anything, not if you're expecting yourself to feel motivated every day to get out
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.140]   there and send out, um, you know, making calls and working on something and
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.980]   building a career website and, uh, uh, you know, it's not, it's not in that
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.100]   situation, it doesn't work in that situation.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.820]   And so if you're going to use it for an adventure, then I say, go for it.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.420]   If you're not going to use it for an adventure, I would say, stay in your
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.780]   apartment, um, where you, you already have the lease, try to find somebody who can
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:19.660]   come and stay with you for a time and use your ability to be in your, your
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.340]   apartment, to be productive and get yourself productive, whether that's to
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.540]   get another job, to do freelance work, to start a business, to do something.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.620]   I don't think it's really possible for most people to, to be very productive
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.180]   when living in their car, uh, not at the level that you're accustomed to being
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:36.780]   productive at.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.540]   Got it.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.020]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.900]   I definitely appreciate that insight.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:48.580]   I think the, the one thing that kind of stuck out at me was, you know, the, you
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.860]   know, just having kind of a plan and frankly, I just hadn't really thought
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:58.020]   about it maybe that much, just due to the fact that if I probably were to do a
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.780]   trip, it would probably necessitate having to, um, you know, have the lease
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.460]   taken care of just because it wouldn't be kind of a, an unnecessary burden to
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.020]   have going if I was going to be gone for a couple of months, um, to kind of have
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.900]   that, you know, that expense still there.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.220]   Right.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.700]   Um, however, you know, with the, the potential of getting that taken care of,
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.940]   you know, I definitely could see a trip, um, and, you know, getting excited about
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:26.420]   that trip.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.700]   Um, and, but one other thing I would throw out there is having kind of been
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.380]   chained to an office for a couple of years, frankly, the, the excitement of
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.980]   some freedom, um, is sort of the exciting thing in itself for me at the moment
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.300]   that can sort of be the, the honey, the honeymoon phase, so to say at the moment.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:53.220]   But, um, it's just sort of, you know, embracing the fact that, uh, you know, I
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.780]   can, um, you know, sleep in a little bit and, um, do things at my own pace and,
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.460]   you know, really just sort of explore, you know, what's, uh, what's on my mind
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.020]   that day.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.740]   And, um, you know, that's been a very illuminating experience that was
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.900]   obviously sort of put to bed, you know, with, uh, corporate life.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.740]   So what I, so to kind of compliment that, what I would say, what I would
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.260]   encourage you is consider using a trip, but then just be open to working on the
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:22.540]   road.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.100]   And just to clarify you're single, not married, no children, no girlfriend, you
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.260]   know, romantic relationships.
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.700]   Correct.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:29.980]   Okay.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.380]   So good.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.660]   So then that allows you to come and go as you like.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.700]   And so what I would say is that consider using a trip, but head for a place where
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.500]   there's easy work, uh, and even work that may not be exactly what you're accustomed
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.700]   to, uh, you know, think about going to Texas and getting a job in the Texas oil
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.180]   fields or, or, or think about heading North and seeing what emerges along the
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.580]   way, because I, I resonate with that.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.420]   Lack of wanting to be in the office.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.420]   And I understand that.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.340]   And so if you're at a point in your life where you've done that for a while, and
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:08.820]   now you're ready for something else, then just use a trip as a, as a, as a way to
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.300]   explore, um, you know, use a trip as a way to explore some other opportunities.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.420]   What are the minimum payments, the minimum monthly payments
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.820]   on your debt at the moment?
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:24.340]   Right now we're looking at about, um, if I were to include that loan that I
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.620]   mentioned earlier, it would be about 1600 bucks, but without it, it's about 800.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.820]   The loan would be for, uh, a refinance.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.820]   I, um, tell me the details of the loan again.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.100]   I missed that when you said it first time.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.300]   Yeah, I'd say it's a personal loan.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.140]   Um, it had been a refinance on some former credit card debt.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.140]   Um, but I had put it into forbearance for about 90 days through April.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.320]   Well,
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:01.380]   if you, if you feel a sense of frustration with the corporate world and
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.780]   you're not, and I, and I say to you, listen, Jeff, just go get another job.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.380]   And you say, I don't want to do it.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.420]   Then I would say that the Prius plan might be a good transition plan.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.820]   If you have the ability to get rid of most of your stuff, uh, except, you
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.700]   know, the basics that you need, pack them in the car.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.180]   Um, and they ask, have you, have you tried sleeping in the Prius?
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.620]   Have you, have you done any nights in the Prius yet at this point?
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.140]   I have a few times and it's, it's not bad.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.900]   Um, you know, I definitely, it's hard to do in the middle of Manhattan, but,
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.420]   you know, you can definitely do it on a, in a quiet area.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.700]   Well, if you're going to travel, so there's, there's the one way to do it
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.220]   was how I've done it, where you fold the back seat forward for the full, the
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.460]   front seat back, um, and just kind of make, do it in a makeshift way.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.420]   That's adequate.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.620]   But what I would say is if you're actually going to do it, do it properly,
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.020]   you know, even take out the passenger seat, um, build a nice sleeping
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.860]   platform that's comfortable, get some bins, you know, get organized.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.340]   The key to being happy in that kind of environment is to be organized.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.300]   You need to be organized.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.580]   You need to have some basic camping gear.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.460]   Uh, you need to have a butane cook stove, uh, some pot.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.380]   Um, you need to have a cooler at the very least.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.300]   It's probably the simplest thing to start with is a high quality cooler,
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.260]   maybe a soft sided cooler, um, like, but get the wall, get the
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.780]   Ozark trail rip off at Walmart.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.980]   But like the soft sided Yetis, those are good.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.500]   And then you can just get ice from time to time from a grocery
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.220]   store, uh, to keep your food in.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.620]   But you need to have the, and then you comfortable chair, a little table.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.660]   So that basically you can pull into a local public park and be comfortable
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.820]   setting up and using a picnic table and cooking and whatnot as well.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.980]   So you're not eating out all the time.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.500]   The thing that'll kill your budget is if you don't have the ability to cook
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.940]   and you're eating out all the time.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.900]   So a simple butane stove that you can get at Walmart, um, a simple cooler to
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:54.340]   keep some cool foods, cold, uh, and, uh, base and basic camping gear and a nice
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.740]   chair and a table where you can be comfortable outside of the car I see
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:03.500]   are, are, are necessary and then work out a bed platform that works for you.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.780]   So if you, if you take the, uh, depending on how tall you are, if you take the
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.060]   seat out, then you could, uh, put the front seat out, you could put a whole
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.780]   bed platform on the right side of it and not even need to put the backseat down,
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.780]   which gives you a place to sit inside the car, still in work in the seat.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.460]   Um, or you can go with the backseat down plan.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.980]   So YouTube is your friend there.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:28.060]   Um, what I would do is if I weren't willing at all to go back to the
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.940]   corporate world, even for a time, and I think you shouldn't dismiss it too
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.860]   quickly, because is it fun to go on the road?
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.580]   Yes.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.980]   Is it fun to go on the road when you got $60,000 of debt and 10,000 in the bank?
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.700]   Well, it's a lot less fun than if you were debt free.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:44.260]   And so if you could get another a hundred thousand dollar a year job, um, a year
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.420]   from now you could be debt free.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.340]   And so if you can stomach the plan to say, I'm going to get a, going to get
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:55.300]   another job, work for a year and, um, earn a hundred thousand dollars and be
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.820]   debt free in a year, it's going to be a lot more fun to do it when you're
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.980]   debt free than right now, if that's not a plan that appeals to you, I don't
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.900]   see why you have to do it.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.860]   I would say go on a trip, um, break the lease.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.820]   And even if you don't make the lease payments, that just simply becomes one
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.460]   more debt that you owe and you can pay it off when you can.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.660]   Uh, I would not, I would not at this point, if I had $10,000, I would not at
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:23.300]   this point feel really good about taking 4,400, uh, and giving it to them.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.100]   So I would either add that onto a credit card somewhere, finance it with a credit
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.060]   card, uh, so that I could stretch out the payments until I could get a job, uh, or
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.140]   just to have it as a debt that I owe and then pay it off in a few months when I
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.820]   get a job, uh, something like that to, to save my cash.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.260]   And then I would head for a place that I'm interested in going and
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.420]   interested in checking out, and I would be open to and look for a job along the
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.180]   way, uh, and I would consider doing some kind of lucrative manual labor job, again,
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.820]   Texas oil fields or, or, or, you know, doing something up North, uh, just because
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:01.500]   it's an interesting way to have a change in your life, uh, that's different than
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   the corporate environment.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.900]   And you might find, you know what, I really liked the corporate environment
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.420]   after all.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.620]   And if you do are doing remote work, you can do that from wherever you
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.980]   happen to wind up being, but a little bit of money coming in so you can get your
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.660]   debt cleared up over the next couple of years will also make any kind of
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.020]   traveling a lot more interesting.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.860]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:24.300]   Um, I'm definitely intrigued by the idea of some of the, uh, um, you know, less
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.620]   common manual labor jobs like, uh, like that.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.020]   So I think, uh, that's definitely something I would look into to, uh,
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.100]   potentially sustain it.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.900]   You can make a lot of money in those fields and if you'll go where the work
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.820]   is, and I mentioned Texas just cause I was in Texas, um, not too long ago and
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.380]   was, was talking to some guys there.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.740]   But if you go to a place like that, where the industry is, is, is booming.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.380]   And if you're willing to do the work, I mean, it's not easy work, but I've
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:57.500]   always found, I've always found manual work to be easier to do than the work
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.380]   that I do, because all I got to do is show up and work hard.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.700]   And that's always, I've been doing that since I was a kid, show up and work hard.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.220]   It's a lot easier for me to avoid work when it's, when it's mental
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.540]   work, sitting in front of a desk.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:16.420]   And the great thing about, about manual work is you, uh, you, you, you go to work,
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.780]   you do the work and then you leave.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.740]   And when you leave the job stays there.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.660]   And as a single guy, you have the ability to take all the extra jobs, to
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.060]   take all the different contracts.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.580]   And there's so many opportunities.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.020]   You can easily make six figures in one of those, in one of those jobs.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.820]   And those jobs work well with a, with a frugal lifestyle, you know,
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.860]   it seems like sometimes it seems to me that half the guys that work in the
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.820]   Texas oil fields live in RVs and they do that because they need to live close to
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.060]   where they are and they need to move around for work, but it also happens to
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.260]   be a fairly frugal way to live.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.220]   Uh, and so depending on how you do it, you know, there, there, you can work
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.820]   offshore, uh, or you're on the, you're on an oil rig for a couple of weeks at a
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.980]   time or a month on, or whatever the shifts are that they're offered, or you
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:06.140]   can do work on, but, but there are ways to make a lot of money in some of that
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:06.820]   kind of work.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.740]   And, uh, I think you would find it refreshing to do some, some physical
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.500]   heavy labor.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.860]   Um, it's, it's easier to do than the office environment, in my opinion, I
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.900]   would rather, if you gave me the choice between going back to a cubicle world.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.140]   As a corporate drone versus going out and doing one of those jobs, uh, where
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.780]   I'm working with a team of guys out in the, out in the woods, uh, or out in the,
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.620]   the desert, I guess it'd be more appropriate.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.860]   Uh, I would take the second option at this point.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.220]   Uh, now you're going to, there's some downsides, right?
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:45.100]   West Texas is not the, the, the most attractive of places to live, but it does
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.660]   fit very well into an extreme lifestyle.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.020]   If you went to a job like that, or went up to, you know, Alaska, or did, you
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.780]   know, find some place where you can make a lot of money, but you're going to a
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:00.900]   place where, where, uh, where workers are needed, you can live the early
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.980]   retirement, extreme lifestyle, live extremely frugally and four or five
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.780]   years later, you've got half a million dollars in the bank.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.340]   Um, and.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.740]   And now you have your freedom to go onto whatever's next.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:18.460]   And so it's one of the fastest ways that I know of to, uh, to reach a
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:24.460]   significant level of, of, of freedom because you go to a high earning place
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.460]   with a low expenses and if you, and if you do, if you just don't drink all the
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.220]   time and blow all your money on stupid stuff, you can save huge amounts of
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.940]   money and very quickly buy your freedom.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.940]   So that's, I would, I would be open to that if that appeals to you.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.980]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:45.380]   Any other, um, industries besides the oil fields, uh, ring any bells for you?
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.140]   It's a good question.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.620]   I don't.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.820]   And that's one of the first ones that, that comes to mind.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.540]   And I've met people doing interesting work, uh, in that industry all
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.100]   over around the, around the, around the country.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.340]   One of the things that I noticed is that that work, depending on the specific
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.740]   kind of work tends to be fairly, it moves.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:17.060]   Uh, and so I've met people in Wyoming, in Idaho and, um, Texas, but at a campground,
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.980]   there's often at least a couple of people that are, their families are living in
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:27.060]   the campground while they're working on their jobs and so I've never really dug
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.380]   into it all that much, um, but that's so, so short answer is no, I don't have
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.780]   anything else that would be where I would start, but I would bet if you, if
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.420]   you went looking and started asking questions and did intense research on
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.340]   that, that there might be other options that would emerge along the way.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.540]   That's the best I got though.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.380]   Um, the other thing I guess would be seasonal work.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.460]   Um, if you're open to doing seasonal work, here it is February.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.140]   So just an example, if you went up to the far North, uh, you know, even Alaska
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.260]   and got yourself some seasonal work, uh, during the summertime up in Alaska, you
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.780]   could get there pretty inexpensively in your Prius, um, then you can do the kind
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.100]   of thing where you work like, like crazy for, for four or five, six months, and
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.660]   then you take the winter off and there are all kinds of opportunities
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.220]   where that could work out.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.100]   Uh, I don't know specifically what they are right now.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.580]   When I was in Alaska though, I did, I did meet people that did that and you, and
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.380]   you see that people will go back, go up and go back and forth.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.740]   And so you have the opportunity to do seasonal work if you're willing to
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.500]   relocate, uh, and you can just simply go where the work is, uh, and, and where
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.340]   you're, where you're paid the most during the summer.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.420]   Got it.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.420]   It makes sense.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.660]   Um, cool.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.780]   I definitely appreciate the insight on, uh, you know, thinking
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.540]   about, uh, some new industries.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:40.980]   Good.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.060]   Anything else?
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:53.140]   Um, what about just sort of, if I were to deem the Prius, you know, not, uh, um,
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.660]   you know, not acceptable for kind of long-term living, do you have any, um,
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.780]   any insight on kind of what maybe a good next step would be?
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.340]   I mean, my Prius is pretty new.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.140]   It's probably worth 10 grand private, private sales.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.100]   So, you know what I mean?
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.220]   I feel like you can do a lot with that, with something
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.220]   else a little more comfortable.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:12.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:19.860]   For a single guy, I would buy, um, either a pickup truck and a truck camper or,
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.700]   uh, a small or an SUV or a pickup truck and a trailer.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.300]   And this would depend a little bit on the kind of work that
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.580]   you imagined yourself doing.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:36.700]   I think one of the best ways to, one of the best, um, Lifestyles is a, is a
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.900]   pickup truck and a truck camper, uh, because it's, they're inexpensive.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.980]   Uh, there, you can buy them inexpensively.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.460]   You don't need anything fancy.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.260]   So if you sold your Prius for 10 grand, you could certainly get yourself a, uh,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:55.020]   a pickup truck and a truck camper for 10 grand and, uh, and they're comfortable.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:00.740]   And unlike the Prius, they allow you to set up and not feel like, uh,
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.900]   not in to feel at home, right?
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.940]   You have a table inside that you can sit at and you can work at.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.460]   You have a proper bed that you can relax in.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.060]   Uh, you have a stove, you have a sink.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.100]   You have water tanks.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.820]   You have those things that make it possible for you to live comfortably.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.700]   And so I like the, the flexibility of a pickup truck and a truck camper.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.420]   Uh, it's one of my favorite ways to do it.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:29.340]   The only downside of a pickup truck and truck camper is that it's not quite as,
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.340]   uh, is, is if you need to drive a lot, if you need to drive your truck.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.700]   So like the oil guys, let's say you were going to go work on the oil field.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.180]   Well, you wouldn't want to pick up truck and a truck camp, or you'd want to pick
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.700]   up truck and a small, uh, travel trailer, because you're going to be need the
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.740]   truck for work and you're going to leave the trailer parked.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.740]   Uh, and I think that that also is a good solution.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.780]   The travel trailers around you might be even cheaper, which would be a better
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.140]   way to start, uh, where you just have a few thousand dollar pickup truck and a
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.820]   few thousand dollar travel trailer.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.380]   You could certainly do that.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:03.060]   And then now you have the ability to live comfortably.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.220]   You can have an actual trailer.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.380]   And so you're going to feel a lot more.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.700]   So give me an example.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.860]   When you're trying to, when you're trying to camp and live in a vehicle, one of the
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.620]   first things is, well, where am I going to be?
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.660]   Where am I going to be during the day?
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.460]   I'm not gonna be driving.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.660]   So where am I actually going to be?
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.700]   And if you're in a Prius, it's hot.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.220]   The best that you can do in a Prius is to sometimes be in the car, but the best that
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.700]   you can do in a Prius is to pull up to a picnic pavilion where you have a table to
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.540]   work on a bench, you can set up a comfortable chair, and then you have a
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.180]   place to cook.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.980]   You have a place to be, you have a place to hang out, but you're always exposed to
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.780]   the weather, even in that circumstance.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.540]   And the weather, what you find is that the weather can start to wear on you.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.740]   Sometimes it's very hot.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.740]   Sometimes it's very cold.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.620]   Sometimes it's windy.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.460]   Sometimes it's rainy.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.220]   Sometimes it's sunny.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:48.940]   It's sunny.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.220]   And you just want to get out of the weather sometimes.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   And so when you, when you go ahead and move up a level to a trailer or to a
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.780]   camper, or you could do a van.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.340]   I also, obviously people do vans, but when you move up a level and you have the
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.860]   ability to get out of the weather, it's really nice because now what was that
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:14.020]   hot, loud, or cold, windy, loud rest area picnic table becomes just your camper
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.220]   that you're parked in, that you're in the rest area for, for the day.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.860]   And you can work on your computer.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.860]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.260]   You can read, you can relax, and you can get out of the rain.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.220]   You can get out of the wind.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.820]   And that's, that's really nice.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.060]   And so it's worth, it's worth it to have that.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.300]   If you think that you're going to do it for, for a longer period of time.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.340]   It's really nice to have that ability.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.580]   So I would shop both of those, go look at some options and see.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:42.100]   Uh, the truck camper can technically be taken off of, uh, a truck and put on the
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.100]   ground, certainly you can do that, but it's a lot bigger of a hassle than a,
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.300]   than a small trailer.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.300]   And so if you were going to work and you were going to go on the road and you're
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.100]   going to be open to working, I would say probably a pickup truck and a small
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.860]   camper and you need, you don't need something big, uh, the, the, the smaller
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.300]   you are, the better, uh, and you can get, um, inexpensive.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.260]   You should, you should be able to find a travel trailer for a few thousand
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.260]   dollars and a pickup truck for a few thousand dollars, and that would be
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.260]   enough to get you on the road.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.540]   Sounds good.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.540]   Anything else?
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.460]   I think, uh, no, I think, uh, we've, uh, exhausted it.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.220]   Good.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.620]   Well, um, I hope that you will have greater clarity and wisdom.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.500]   I just encourage you use the money that you have to get yourself started.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.940]   It is when you got $10,000 in the bank, it's easy to make a transition like you
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.580]   are making, because you can float your bills for a little while you can float
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.820]   your bills and, and generate some income along the way, but you still only have a
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.540]   few months of, um, few months of, of wiggle room.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:49.980]   Uh, and what I would say is as quickly as you can, um, as quickly as you can
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:55.300]   look for a way to earn some income, live frugally and get your debt paid off.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.780]   Because if you can go from having $60,000 of debt and no income to having
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.540]   $0 of debt and no income, you're going to have a very different
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.060]   experience with those two things.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.460]   So if you want to make a transition, you can make a transition when you're in debt,
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.220]   but it's a lot easier when you're totally debt-free and a lot more fun.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.500]   Absolutely.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.220]   All right, Jeff, thanks for calling in and I wish you all the best.
