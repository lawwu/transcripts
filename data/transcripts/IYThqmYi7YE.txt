[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Well, how do we discern false teachers?
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.280]   It's a hot topic in our inbox.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.840]   It's always been a hot topic in our inbox.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.720]   And here is one representative email sent in by a listener to the podcast named Criker.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.360]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm a huge fan and love listening to these podcast episodes.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.880]   APJ has really helped me grow in my faith and convictions as well as in making me better
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.640]   at helping others in their own struggles.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   Amen."
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   Let me just stop there.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.720]   Criker, that is one reason why this podcast exists, to see that you are being equipped
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   to help the people in your life in their moments of need.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.840]   That's so encouraging to read that.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.400]   Okay, back to Criker's question.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.640]   "My question is this.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.800]   The Bible gives us a lot of warnings about false teachers, but how can I identify if
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.120]   someone on the internet I listen to is a false teacher themselves?
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.680]   A number of people have been accused of being false teachers.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.600]   Pastor John, what should I be looking for?"
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.640]   Well, I would start by saying, don't set the bar so low that you only stop listening to
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.200]   people if they can be properly called false teachers.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.800]   Lots of people are teachers who are simply misguided and unhelpful in many ways, but
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.840]   might not come under the ban of being called a false teacher.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.680]   Set your standards high.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.200]   Listen to people who are truly God-centered, Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated, Spirit-dependent,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.980]   who bear the marks in their lives of authenticity.
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.640]   But since you asked about identifying false teaching and false teachers, let me give you
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   four biblical ways to assess whether someone is a false teacher.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.120]   I do this just because the Bible agrees with you that we should be alert to the reality
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.880]   of false teachers, and it gives us tests.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.040]   First, there's the test of the fruit of their lives.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:22.960]   Jesus says in Matthew 7, 15, "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.020]   but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.420]   You will recognize them by their fruits.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.160]   Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?"
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.680]   So every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.300]   A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.880]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.560]   Thus, you will recognize them by their fruits.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:09.760]   Now Paul put a huge premium on this principle of holiness and righteousness in his own life,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.600]   giving credibility to his gospel.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.560]   I saw this recently just because I'm working my way through 1 Thessalonians and look at
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.880]   the book, and it just leaped.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.760]   I mean, he made such a huge deal out of it for two chapters.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.600]   But here's what he says in 1 Thessalonians 1, 5, "Our gospel came to you not only in
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.080]   word but also in power and in the Holy Spirit with full conviction, just as you know what
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.280]   kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake."
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   Amazing.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.640]   And then he unpacks that for two chapters, what kind of men we prove to be.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.800]   To judge us by the fruits of our lives.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.920]   Now of course it's not always easy to see the behavioral fruit of a teacher, especially
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.200]   internet teachers, right?
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.600]   Which is why you need to look carefully and take time and belong to a church, a real live
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:23.120]   human being, flesh and blood, in-person church with a real live preacher whose life you know.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.840]   So whether it's hard or not, Jesus said, "You will know them by their fruits."
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.720]   Second, there's the test of sound central doctrines.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.120]   For example, the doctrine of incarnation in 1 John 4, 1-3, where John says, "Beloved,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.280]   do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.320]   For many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.080]   By this you will know the Spirit of God."
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:59.360]   Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.560]   And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.720]   In other words, if someone denies that Jesus Christ is the God-man, God come in the flesh,
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.960]   he's a false teacher or a false prophet.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.880]   John doesn't mean to say that if you get the incarnation right, there are no other mistakes
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.480]   you can make that are serious.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.600]   That's not the point.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.320]   He was simply dealing with that particular issue in that church, and on that issue, confessing
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.280]   that Christ had come in the flesh meant that you were speaking the truth of God.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.120]   You got that one right, and that was the issue in that church.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.000]   Paul emphasized the same doctrinal importance, the doctrinal test.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.560]   In 1 Timothy 6-3, he says, "If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.440]   the sound words of our Lord Jesus and the teaching that accords with godliness, he's
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.120]   puffed up with conceit and understands nothing."
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:10.140]   In other words, we need to measure the doctrines that are being taught by the sound words of
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.680]   our Lord Jesus Christ and by their implications for godliness.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.720]   That's test number two, doctrine, sound doctrine.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.320]   Third, there is the test of submission to Scripture.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:30.520]   Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14-37, "If anyone thinks he's a prophet or spiritual, he should
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:39.280]   acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord."
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.360]   If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.200]   That's amazing.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.520]   The authority of the apostles must be submitted to, or you're a false teacher.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.880]   You're not recognized.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.840]   John said it this way, 1 John 4-6, "We are from God.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.520]   Whoever knows God listens to us.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.240]   Whoever is not from God does not listen to us.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.160]   By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:19.540]   In other words, the apostles elevated their teaching to the level of a test of truth.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:26.560]   If a person does not submit his thinking and his teaching to the authority of the apostles,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.240]   to the authorized teachers of Christ who wrote the New Testament, then they're not going
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.960]   to be reliable teachers.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.920]   It doesn't mean they won't say true things.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.480]   Everybody says true things from time to time, even the devil, but that doesn't make them
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.360]   reliable teachers.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.040]   Finally, there is the test of the gospel itself.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.000]   Paul is just red hot about this one.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.080]   Galatians 1, 8 and 9, "Even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.800]   contrary to the one preached to you, let him be accursed, damned.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:15.320]   As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.280]   to the one that you received, let him be accursed."
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.960]   And the gospel he had in mind when he said that was the gospel laid out in the book of
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.640]   Galatians, and it's the gospel of justification by faith alone apart from works of the law.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:38.240]   And he sums it up like this in chapter 5, verse 2, "Look, I, Paul, say to you that
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:47.080]   if you accept circumcision," that is, as a step toward getting right with God in justification,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.840]   if you accept circumcision, "Christ will be of no advantage to you.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:03.800]   I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he's obligated to keep the whole law."
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.880]   In other words, if you insist on law-keeping as a way of justification before God, you
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.640]   got to keep it all, and you got to keep it perfectly.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.760]   And then he ends with this terrible warning, "You are severed from Christ, you who would
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.360]   be justified by the law.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.860]   You have fallen away from grace."
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.080]   So there are at least four biblical tests for false teaching.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.800]   One, the test of the fruit of behavior.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.120]   Two, the test of sound doctrine.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.840]   Three, the test of submission to Scripture.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.880]   Four, the test of teaching the pure gospel of justification by faith.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.300]   And I would end by simply reminding us that the best way to protect ourselves from false
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:10:01.860]   teachers is to be part of a healthy Bible-preaching church and to be prayerfully saturated with
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.620]   the Bible every day.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.540]   That's clear and sobering and helpful.
