[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   If you could go back, just look at the entirety of your life you accomplished, more than most
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.120]   humans will ever do.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.000]   If you could go back and relive a single moment in your life, what would that moment be?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   There are moments in my life when I think about what could be done differently.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.880]   No, experience happiness and joy and pride, just to touch once again.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.480]   I made many mistakes in my life, so I know that.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   At the end of the day, I believe in the butterfly effect.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.280]   I knew moments where I could...
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.400]   Now if I'm there at that point in '89, in '93, pick up a year, I could improve my actions
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.720]   by not doing this stupid thing.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.360]   But then how do you know that I will have all other accomplishments?
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.720]   I'm afraid that we just have to just follow this, if you may call it wisdom, or forest
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720]   gump.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   My life is a box of chocolate and you don't know what's inside, but you have to go one
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.040]   by one.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.800]   I'm happy with who I am and where I am today.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.120]   I am very proud, not only with my chess accomplishments, but that I made this transition.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.640]   Since I left chess, I built my own reputation that had some influence on the game of chess,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.240]   but it's not directly derived from the game.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.880]   I'm grateful for my wife who helped me to build this life.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.280]   We actually married in 2005.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.400]   It was my third marriage, that's why I said I made mistakes in my life.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.880]   By the way, I'm close with two kids from my previous marriages.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.800]   I managed to balance my life.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.480]   Here I live in New York, so we have our two kids born here in New York.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.600]   It's new life and it's busy.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.480]   Sometimes I wish I could limit my engagement in many other things that are still taking
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.620]   time and energy, but life is exciting.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.560]   As long as I can feel that I have energy, I have strength, I have passion to make the
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.680]   difference, I'm happy.
