[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   We are considering at the present time the first two verses in the twelfth chapter of
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.120]   Paul's epistle to the Romans, which read like this in the authorised version.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.800]   I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.320]   a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.320]   And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.200]   that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.840]   Now we've reached the point at which we are considering the first phrase in the second
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.920]   verse, 'be not conformed to this world'.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.480]   You notice the progression of the thought; the apostle is making an appeal to Christian
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.560]   people to put into practice the things that he had already been outlining to them.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.240]   He shows them that there are two great motives, in other words, for Christian living; the
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.840]   motive of working out the doctrine and the great motive of gratitude and of thankfulness.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.160]   And then he has gone on to address them in the form of an exhortation or injunction,
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.440]   and that is that they present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:36.080]   God, which is our reasonable or spiritual or intelligent or mental service.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.960]   We've dealt with that.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.880]   Now having done that, he comes on to this second great exhortation.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.160]   I have suggested that there is a progression in the thought here in this way, that he starts
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.640]   with the body and then goes on to the realm of the soul.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.160]   And that is what we are dealing with at the present time.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   Now here we are dealing with this most practical and urgently important matter.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.520]   I was trying to show last Friday night, as you remember, most of you, the extreme urgency
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.080]   of the relevance of this statement to the situation in which we find ourselves at the
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   present time, not only as individuals but also as members of the Christian Church.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   I'm trying to show that some of our most urgent problems are dealt with in this great
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.640]   comprehensive statement in these first two verses of this twelfth chapter of the Epistle
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   to the Romans.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.800]   Now then, because it is such an important subject, it's important that we should be
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.080]   clear about our terms.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.760]   So we spent most of our time last Friday in defining what is meant by this word 'world'.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.400]   It is this outlook, man's outlook apart from God.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.080]   Man thinking of his life in this world and of himself apart from God and the revelation
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   of God.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.840]   That is what is meant by living according to this world.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.200]   It is thought and practice governed by the devil instead of being governed by God.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.640]   It is man living to his own glory instead of living to the glory of God.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.760]   And I tried to show last week that unfortunately this is the very thing that is happening at
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.720]   the present time, unfortunately not in the world so much as in the Church.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.360]   And I tried to show how the thinking of the Church is governed by something which is the
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.280]   exact opposite of this.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.640]   That theology, the modern theology, is entirely governed by the outlook of the world.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.880]   It starts by asking what is the modern man capable of believing?
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.760]   And thereby it has already surrendered to the mind of this present world.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.920]   And I tried to show that the same thing unfortunately tends to be the case also with so much of
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   modern evangelism.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.960]   And thirdly, how it tends even to govern moral theory.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.180]   I haven't come to the realm of practice yet.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.680]   We were only dealing with theory last week.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.080]   I tried to show that the moral outlook, I indicated what is happening in Sweden as an
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.640]   example of this, modern moral theorizing is governed again by what the man in the street
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.640]   thinks.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.820]   Your laws are governed by that, laws are changed solely with that end and object in view.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.440]   And so we see that speaking generally, the thinking of the Church and the world today
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.840]   are governed by the mind of this world, which is the direct opposite to and contradiction
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.760]   of what the Apostle tells us here.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.040]   But now having made that statement, and I made the statement in that way, I think you'll
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.780]   recall in general, I feel constrained to issue a word of warning.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.760]   In other words, I wasn't able to say all that I'd got to say last Friday night.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.720]   I had to leave my statement, owing to the exigencies of time, incomplete.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.540]   And it would be very wrong indeed if we were to leave it at that point.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.520]   I have stated the principle, and I repeat it.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.880]   It is wrong for the Church to allow her theology to be governed by the mind and outlook of
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.160]   the world.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.640]   It is wrong for the Church to allow her evangelism to be governed by the mind and thinking and
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.960]   outlook of the world.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:58.920]   It is wrong for the Church to allow her moral teaching and instruction to be governed by
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.440]   the mind and thought and outlook of the world.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.400]   There is the principle, the general principle.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.680]   But having said that, I have to now come to what I'm calling a word of warning.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:20.400]   For instance, in the realm of thought, or in the realm of theology, while I still repeat
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.360]   my general principle, I have got to go on to point out that we are doing something which
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:36.520]   is very wrong and reprehensible if we interpret it in terms of becoming obscurantist.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.880]   You see the danger with the thought that we react so violently from one extreme to the
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.560]   other, don't we?
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.280]   And the danger that has often confronted Christian people, it is always a danger, and especially
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:56.400]   with the more conscientious Christian people, to swing right over from the extreme of being
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.480]   governed by the mind and thought and outlook of the world to the exact opposite which is
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   obscurantism.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.720]   Now what do I mean by that?
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.080]   Well, let me give you one illustration.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.160]   You have often seen references, no doubt in the newspapers or in other places, to the
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.880]   Roman Catholic Church and their opposition to Galileo and what she did about him.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.000]   You remember it's a point that is so often brought against the whole of Christianity,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.280]   and many people try to dismiss the whole of Christianity in terms of that.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.360]   But they say, "Look, look at the Roman Church, how she upheld the teaching of this new astronomy,"
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.760]   and so on, at that point in history.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.120]   Now we've got to face this, I think, quite frankly and quite honestly.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.040]   When the Church opposed their teaching, she was doing something that was wrong.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.840]   She was guilty of obscurantism.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.520]   But the important thing for us to discover is this, why she ever fell into that error.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.960]   And you and I can fall into the same error unless we are clear about this matter.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:16.800]   Now what happened, of course, was this, that the Roman Catholic Church, instead of having
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:29.440]   her thinking determined solely by the Bible, was being governed by the Bible plus the philosophy
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.960]   of Aristotle, which is such a fundamental part of the dogmatic teaching of the Roman
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.920]   Catholic Church.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.040]   She had gone beyond the Bible.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:46.960]   In other words, there is nothing in the Bible itself which is opposed to this new teaching
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.160]   concerning astronomy, which came in round about to the end of the 16th and the beginning
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.840]   of the 17th century.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.200]   But the Roman Catholic Church said this was wrong, it is contrary to the teaching of the
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   Church.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   But what she meant by the teaching of the Church was the Bible plus what they had added
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.480]   to that in terms of their own philosophical thinking.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.760]   Now this is always a very real danger.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.520]   And so you see, because this new teaching didn't fit in with what the Church had always
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.200]   taught about the universe, they condemned it and said that it was wrong.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.800]   But by now they know and are there to admit that they were wrong.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.080]   Now there is an illustration which I give of this particular danger.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.440]   In other words, we must always be governed by the clear teaching of the Bible.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.200]   If the Bible doesn't teach us about a certain matter, well then we mustn't say that this
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.600]   is the biblical teaching.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.200]   We must realize it's our opinion.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   And our opinions can be wrong, though we are Christians.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.640]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.120]   While we must never submit to the mind of the teaching and the outlook of the world,
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.960]   we must be equally careful never to become traditionalists.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.120]   Now you know the difference between tradition and traditionalism.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:22.720]   Thank God for every good tradition, but God preserve us from traditionalism.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.760]   A man who is guilty of traditionalism is a man who starts by saying everything new is
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   wrong.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.880]   Now the moment you get into that position, you're in as bad a position as the man who
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.600]   is submitting on the other extreme to the mind and the thinking and the outlook of the
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   world.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.200]   There are two extremes here.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.080]   Worldliness, traditionalism.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.680]   Anything new must be wrong.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.440]   Anything I've never heard before is certain to be wrong.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.520]   Now that's an attitude which is not biblical.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.760]   My principle is that we are never to be at either of these extremes, but we are always
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   to be in the biblical position.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.240]   Now it's not so easy, of course, to be in the biblical position as it is to be at the
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   extremes.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.400]   Extremes are always easy.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.000]   But if you're in the biblical position, you will be aware of certain tensions.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.440]   Everything will be cut and dried.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.120]   There's a craving in us all for a sort of ready-reckner Christianity.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   Problem?
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.120]   Turn it up.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   Here you are.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   But you can't do that.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.520]   That isn't the biblical teaching.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.460]   It always leaves you with a certain tension, and it avoids the two extremes.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:41.000]   So I say in the realm of thinking, we must be careful, not only on the one hand of worldliness,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.720]   but on the other of a death of skewrentism and mere traditionalism.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.480]   I could illustrate this to you from other examples of history, but let that suffice
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   for the present time.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.720]   But now let's come on and give the same sort of warning in the matter of evangelism.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.800]   And this is quite a topical matter at the present time.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.320]   There's a good deal of talk about this, and I think a good deal of confusion also.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:17.200]   Now I've laid down the principle, and I must repeat it, that our evangelism must never
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.760]   be governed by the mind and the outlook and the thinking of the world.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.680]   But once more, we've got to be very careful that we don't react so violently to that as
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:36.800]   to go to another extreme, which in my opinion is equally wrong and equally bad.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.520]   What do I mean by that?
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:46.320]   Well, we must be very careful, lest in our desire not to be worldly in our evangelistic
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:54.480]   methods, we put ourselves into a position in which we lose any point of contact whatsoever
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.740]   with the world which is round and about us.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:08.040]   And we become again guilty of another form of traditionalism, or indeed a form of legalism.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   What am I talking about?
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.680]   Well, let me illustrate to you.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.320]   There are many people who are in great trouble about evangelistic methods.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.520]   It's quite right that we should consider these.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:24.640]   That's why I mentioned it and dealt with it in terms of my principle last Friday night.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.520]   But God forbid that I should be misunderstood about this.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.800]   There are people you know who object to the singing of hymns and regard it as virtually
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   sinful.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.880]   Now that's the sort of thing that needs to be examined.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:49.760]   There are people who object to certain forms of, or certain things which are used in connection
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   with evangelism.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.720]   Now I happen to have had the problem put to me a number of times quite recently, so I
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.160]   mention it to you.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.640]   A number of Christian people in different parts of this country are beginning to use
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:10.160]   what is called, I believe I'm using the correct term, "coffee bar evangelism".
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.000]   What it means as I understand it is this.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.400]   I know of one instance, for example, where a certain group of Christian men have taken
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.560]   over a building and they go there at a certain hour every night and they open this place,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.080]   it's all done on a voluntary basis, and they provide tea and coffee and so on, and
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:37.560]   invite people in off the street, particularly young boys and girls, young men and women
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.000]   who are leading the sort of life that we read about in the newspapers, but which many of
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.040]   us know nothing at all about in practice.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.240]   They're concerned about these people, so they invite them in, give them coffee or tea,
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:56.560]   whatever it may be, and then they address them on the subject of their souls and the
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.520]   way of salvation.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.160]   Now this is subject to a great deal of criticism from many people.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.280]   They say that's a worldly method, fancy supplying coffee.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.160]   This is regarded as something terrible, it's wrong, and it shouldn't be done.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.680]   And then of course there are various other things that are being done at the present
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.360]   time which come under criticism in exactly the same way.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.400]   Now I'm simply raising this question and showing you that there are dangers on the
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:33.200]   extreme opposite of submitting to worldly thinking and worldly ideas and worldly methods.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.360]   I am suggesting that the thing we have to be very careful about as we interpret this
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:47.680]   instruction is that we do not develop a hypercritical spirit, that we never allow ourselves to get
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.800]   into a position in which we are reacting so violently to what some people are doing, that
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.280]   we are virtually spiritual detectives and inspectors and are waiting for things on which
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.560]   we can pounce and which we can denounce and decry, simply because they haven't been
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:09.040]   done in the past, simply because they're something new, and simply because they're
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.120]   the sort of thing that we would not instinctively do ourselves.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.920]   Now then, is this just my personal opinion?
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.480]   Well let me show you that it isn't, but that it is biblical teaching.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.280]   There is a great warning, it seems to me, from the scriptures and from history to us
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.920]   at this point.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.960]   My dear friends, we've got to watch our spirits.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.640]   We may be very clear about worldly methods, all right, I've laid it down as a principle
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:41.200]   myself and we must always adhere to it, but let us be very careful that we don't develop
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.600]   a false spirit in this matter.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   What's my warning?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:54.100]   Well I take as the great warning the way in which the Pharisees and scribes reacted to
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.200]   our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.560]   They saw the publicans and the sinners drawing near unto him, and they saw that he was ready
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.160]   to receive them, that he was ready to sit down with them and to eat and drink with them,
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.660]   and they turned at him aghast and said, "This man receiveth sinners.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.880]   This man is a friend of publicans and sinners.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.440]   He's a wine-bibber."
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.000]   They were amazed at this.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.720]   Fancy our Lord mixing with people like that and sitting down and eating and drinking with
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   them.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.880]   To the Pharisees this was a terrible thing.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   It was unthinkable.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:38.160]   Yes, but remember, it is the measure of their complete failure in the realm of spirit to
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.640]   understand the whole object of the coming of our blessed Lord into this world.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.000]   That is the terrible thing about the Pharisees.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.040]   Or take it in exactly the same way, you find that the same kind of people who were called
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:18:01.640]   Judaizers later on, followed the Apostle Paul everywhere and were highly critical of his
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.600]   methods and his dealings with the Gentiles.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.720]   They said, "This man's quite wrong.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.400]   He's doing something that has never been done before, and he doesn't compel these
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.920]   people to submit to circumcision and so on."
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.360]   Now that was the whole error.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:20.520]   They thought that the Apostle Paul was being lax and loose in his evangelism and in his
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   methods.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.400]   There's no question about this.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.240]   And then when you come down in history, let me just take one example and illustration.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:38.080]   The great George Whitefield got into trouble because of his open air preaching.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.040]   John Wesley stumbled at this.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.000]   He couldn't understand this.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.720]   George Whitefield was preaching in the open air, but you shouldn't preach anywhere except
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.360]   in a consecrated building.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.040]   What right is a man to preach in a building which hasn't been consecrated, or standing
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.080]   on a table or on a stone in the open air?
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.760]   That place hasn't been consecrated, and you mustn't preach and evangelize except
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.280]   in a consecrated building.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.360]   Now this was quite a genuine objection.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.120]   And he thought that he was being biblical, and he wasn't the only one of course.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.480]   He was convinced about this quite soon and began to do it himself.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.240]   But there were many who thought that this was a terrible thing to do, and a terribly
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.940]   wrong thing for a man to do.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.560]   He was doing something new.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.320]   It had never been done before.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.920]   And this was therefore queried.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   Can this be right?
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.840]   This new method that this man is using?
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.560]   Now here, and I could give you other examples of the same thing, here I'm showing you
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:40.800]   is a very great and a very real danger to those of us who are so clear about not being
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.840]   governed by the mind and the thinking and the outlook of the world.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.440]   Our danger is to go so far to the rather extreme as to become guilty of the spirit and the
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.840]   outlook of the Pharisees and scribes, the traditionalists.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.040]   Now I'm saying we must never become traditionalists.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.920]   There are certain poles of opposites here which we must be clear about.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.400]   Well then, what do we say about this question?
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.520]   Well, I would suggest that we must say something like this.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:19.480]   We must always in these matters be quite certain that we are being controlled by biblical teaching
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.320]   and thinking and not by our own personal prejudices.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.040]   We mustn't be governed by prejudices.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.600]   We mustn't be governed by tradition.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.920]   We must always be governed by biblical thinking.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:39.600]   If we are not, we shall soon find ourselves resisting and opposing some new thing that
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   God is doing in a difficult age such as this.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.640]   It's a very subtle matter this.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.320]   But it must always be biblical.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.200]   And if we can't prove it's biblical, well then, I say, we must be very careful in what
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   we say.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.160]   And so I've often had to say to our friends who are opposed to singing hymns and who say
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.720]   we should sing nothing but songs, let them prove it.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   They can't do that.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.760]   Take the passage we read from Ephesians 5.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.000]   What are those spiritual songs?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.160]   I have no doubt whatsoever that it means singing under the direct inspiration of the spirit,
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.040]   exactly as you have it in 1 Corinthians 14.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   I'm not going into that.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.640]   I dealt with it at length one Sunday morning or two Sunday mornings, if I remember rightly,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640]   in this pulpit.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:32.280]   However, I'm only showing you the danger of being governed by a rigid traditionalism.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.040]   And though you think you're serving God, you may be opposing some new thing that God is
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   doing.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.400]   Secondly, we must never be governed by the spirit of fear.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.960]   The spirit of fear is a very terrible thing.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.360]   Some of the most terrible crimes have been committed as a result of the spirit of fear.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:58.680]   A man can be very honest, but if he's governed by the spirit of fear and concerned only about
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:06.740]   his own correctitude, he puts himself, I say, into a very dangerous position.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:12.000]   So if ever we find ourselves in these matters primarily concerned about ourselves and our
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.600]   own correctness, we are already in danger.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.400]   Or let me put that positively.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:29.340]   If a concern for the souls and the salvation of others is not my main and my leading motive,
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.160]   I must be very careful what I say about evangelism.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.320]   I should always maintain my evangelistic concern.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.240]   If that isn't primary, there's something wrong with me.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.640]   This is the primary task of the Church, is to evangelize, to preach the gospel of salvation
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.920]   that the souls of men may be saved.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.940]   The primary business of the Church is not always to be guarding our own correctness
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.400]   and our own perfection.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.920]   You know, you can put an iron curtain round yourself in a spiritual sense, you'll be absolutely
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:10.200]   perfect at any rate in theory, and you'll be completely useless in the matter of evangelism.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.360]   But every man examine himself in this matter.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.480]   There are people who spend the whole of their time in safeguarding themselves and their
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.440]   doctrines and their activities, that in the end there is no activity as regards the outside
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440]   world.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.240]   That is always wrong, always.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.880]   The primary task of the Church is that of evangelism.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.240]   But let me go on.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.840]   There's one side, here's the other.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.680]   We must never trust the methods.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.320]   That's where these people go wrong, is that they put their faith in their methods.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.000]   They've got this new method which they've borrowed from the world, and this is going
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.920]   to do it, and they put it into practice.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   And of course they get some sort of results, but what are they?
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.480]   That's because they put their trust in methods.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.240]   So I would lay down as a principle that we must always reduce our methods to the absolute
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:02.960]   minimum, as little as is possible.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.400]   That's a good rule, I think.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.240]   But let me put it in biblical terms.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.320]   Take what the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 9.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.880]   He says, "I have made all things to all men that I might by all means save some."
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.680]   Now that's an apologia.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.560]   The Apostle is justifying his own evangelistic methods.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.920]   He was being misunderstood, and as I say, grievously persecuted by the legalists and
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   the Judaizers.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   That's his answer.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.400]   "I have made all things to all men that I might by all means save some."
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   What's it mean?
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.120]   Well, I think it means this.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.960]   There must never be any variation in the message.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.240]   The message is one.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.680]   And we must never vary the message in any sense.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:56.200]   But I think he equally clearly teaches that we must have a certain degree of elasticity
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.760]   in our methods.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.520]   When he deals with a Jew, as with a Jew; Gentile, as with a Gentile; to a man who is under the
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.680]   law, as under the law; to a man who is not under the law, as without the law.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.700]   Not that we are without law altogether, he says, but as under the law of Christ.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:24.040]   So I say that there is the principle that you never touch or vary the message, but that
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.520]   there is an element of elasticity in the method in this way.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:34.000]   That you have always got to speak to the people you're dealing with.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.600]   And you've got to deal with them as they are, not as you wish them to be.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.760]   Now, of course, every preacher wished that he'd got men before him always, every time
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.000]   he preaches, who know their Bible from cover to cover, and have read all the theology,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.800]   and are well versed in the Puritans.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.600]   Here they are, they're ready for it.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   But you know, it's very seldom one gets a congregation like that.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.600]   And if a preacher doesn't preach to the congregation that is in front of him, he'd better go out
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.040]   to the pulpit.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   A preacher's not to preach to people as he'd like them to be, he is to preach to them as
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.080]   they are.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.400]   And if I don't make my message clear to people as they are, I'm a very bad preacher.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.120]   I say, but they oughtn't to be like that.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.680]   The moment I say that, I'm being a bad preacher.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.200]   It's my business to improve them.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.880]   And if I don't start with them as they are, I'll never help them.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.400]   It's no use my giving a great exposition of the law to a man who knows nothing about the
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   law.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.920]   I've got to teach him about the law first, and so on.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.120]   That's exactly what the great apostle did.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.800]   And you and I have got to do the same thing.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   What do we know, my friends, about some of these poor adolescents of this present age,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.760]   who've never had a chance in life, many of them, kicked about from pillar to post by
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.360]   drunken parents and others?
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.160]   What do we know about them and their background?
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.320]   What right have we to postulate as to what these people should be like?
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:06.560]   I say our business is to deal with them as they are, and to try by all means to bring
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.840]   the knowledge of the law to them.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.400]   "Ah, but you say you're opening the door now to everything."
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   I'm not.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.880]   I'm not controlling it in this way.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.800]   I say your message doesn't vary.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:22.920]   I'll add to that, your motive must always be constant, and your motive must always be
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.160]   to bring them to a knowledge of salvation.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.040]   And if you are confronted by a situation that you can make no contact at all with these
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.960]   people, except you give them a cup of coffee, well, I say in the name of God, give them
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.360]   many cups of coffee.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   What is your concern?
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:48.720]   Is it the purity of your church and your methods, or is it the salvation of the souls of men
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.040]   and women and boys and girls who are going to hell round and about?
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.560]   As long as your motive is correct and pure, it will govern your methods.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:06.040]   So I would say to many of the friends who are submitting to worldly methods, you must
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.400]   never go in for change for the sake of change.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.720]   But on the other hand, you must never say that all change is wrong, or you'll be with
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.440]   the Pharisees and the scribes.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.680]   There must never be any likeness.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.920]   You must never allow your methods to contradict your message.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.080]   And how the giving of a cup of coffee contradicts the message passes my comprehension.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.680]   I just can't see it.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.040]   Of course, if you're going to rely upon cups of coffee, then you're wrong again,
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.640]   because you're relying upon something you shouldn't rely upon.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.120]   It's only a means to an end.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.520]   You rely upon the word and the spirit upon the word.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.840]   You see, you've got extremes here.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   It isn't simple.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.600]   You can't lay down absolute rules and laws.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.760]   It's a very easy thing to criticize people and their methods, but be very careful that
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:00.120]   you're not criticizing a work of God, something that God is prepared to honor, though you
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.880]   may think it's very defective.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.680]   So there are two great extremes here.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.040]   We must never be guilty of rigidity.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.620]   Neither must we, on the other hand, ever be guilty of laxity.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.960]   We must never be guilty of rigidity.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.800]   Neither must we, on the other hand, ever be guilty of laxity.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.000]   These are extremes, and both are wrong.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.920]   The Christian who's rigid is a very poor Christian.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.520]   He's really a legalist.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.000]   He's probably suffering from the spirit of fear.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.280]   He doesn't know much about the freedom and the liberty of the children of God.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.280]   Rigidity, laxity, both are wrong.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.800]   The Christian is holding a balance here in the middle.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   He knows his truth.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.880]   He knows his motives.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.480]   He knows his own heart.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:01.720]   And he only implies methods to get a point of contact, to give an opportunity for the
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.720]   gospel.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   That's his only concern.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   And even there, I say, he's always got to keep watch on this, that he never goes so
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:15.480]   far in that respect that his method is ultimately contradicting his message.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.360]   I suggest you can never get closer to a definition than that.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.360]   None of you are ready reckoners in the spiritual life.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.360]   You can't turn it up.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   Here it is.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.360]   Impossible.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.360]   That's pharisaism.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.680]   This is a matter of the spirit.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.600]   Let's watch our spirits.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.720]   There are grave dangers at the two extremes.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.960]   But come, let's go beyond that.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.840]   Now let's come to the realm of practice.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.600]   There we have qualified, not qualified, but explained perhaps more fully, yes, and in
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.560]   a sense qualified, what I was saying last week.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.000]   Because if you left it only at that, it is an extreme emphasis.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.840]   You've got to keep the two sides in view.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.360]   Having done that, let's come to the question now of actual practice.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.840]   Be not conformed to this world.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.320]   No longer thinking, but practice.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.920]   And yet, of course, thinking comes in all the time.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.640]   The same general point has to be made here once more.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:18.960]   We must avoid the extreme, which will always lead us to miss the true biblical position.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.600]   I'm certain as I say this, that I'm being misunderstood.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.320]   And people are saying, "Oh, he's become a compromiser, has he?
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.280]   I thought he was a man who held his view strongly.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.600]   Now he's saying a bit of this and a bit of that."
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.000]   There it is, common denominator divided by two.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.880]   I'm saying the exact opposite.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:40.360]   I'm saying that you've got to hold two positions in tension, which is much more difficult.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.520]   But that, I believe, is the truly biblical position.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.240]   Let me show you what I mean now then in practice.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.200]   Be not conformed to this world.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.680]   "All right," says a man listening to me.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.920]   I agree with that 100%.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.800]   And therefore, I am going out of the world tonight.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.320]   I am going to be a monk.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.360]   I am going to enter a monastery.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.840]   I am finishing with the world.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.000]   You can't be a Christian in this world.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.920]   And I am told here that I must not be conformed to it.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.680]   How can a man be in business without being conformed to the world?
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.600]   How can a man be in a profession without being conformed to this world?
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.160]   "No, no, there's only one thing to do.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.360]   I'm getting out of it."
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.840]   So he becomes a monk or an anchorite or a hermit.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.360]   That's what I call one of the wrong extremes, my friend.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.880]   You see, this violent reaction.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.600]   The only way not to be conformed to the world is to go out of the world.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.480]   That was the whole fallacy behind monasticism.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.760]   And it was a terrible and a grievous fallacy.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.400]   It was a failure to understand New Testament teaching.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:49.640]   And of course this was the grand thing that was given to Martin Luther to see.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.280]   And we need, many of us, to see the same thing at this present time.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:59.640]   But then, short of monasticism, there is a second danger which I would describe under
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   the heading of legalism.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.520]   Legalism.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.880]   Be not conformed to the world.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.120]   Now then, the devil comes and he'll get you right over to a legalistic position.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.720]   Well, of course, it always appears the easy way, doesn't it?
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.760]   As I've said already, we all like to have rules and regulations.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.200]   We've got a feeling always that it's easier to be under the law than under grace.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   It's all cut and dried.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, there they are all numbered.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.480]   And all you do is to look up the number.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   Perfectly simple.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.480]   No trouble at all.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.400]   But you know, that isn't the position of the New Testament men.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.840]   The New Testament men is not under law.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.280]   He is under grace.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.440]   And he's being treated as a man.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.640]   As the apostle Paul says, while you were children and infants, you needed a pedagogue, a schoolmaster,
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.760]   somebody to look after you and to keep you in order.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   But you're no longer there.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.760]   You've been taken out of there.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.960]   That doesn't mean, of course, lawlessness as I'm going to show you.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.320]   But it does mean that you're not under law.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.160]   It seems easier always to be under law.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.240]   And that is why we always tend, when we meet a text like this, to switch right back and
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.320]   to go into legalism once more.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.280]   Now, I want to show you, and I'm going to give you a modern illustration of this very
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.080]   danger to which I am referring.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.720]   Have you ever heard anything of people called Mennonites?
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   Some of you have.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.920]   If you've ever been in America, you've come across them.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.800]   Or if you've ever read the whole story of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century,
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.320]   you must have read something about them.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:48.360]   There were many groups, you remember, in that early Protestant period.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.680]   And amongst them, there was a man of the name of Mennon.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.120]   He was a Dutchman, and he had a particular teaching.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.960]   He really belonged to one of the branches of what is called Anabaptism.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.840]   And of course, with the migrations to America, it spread to America.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:08.400]   And at the present time, there is a body of Mennonites and a particular subdivision of
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   them called the Amish.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.920]   Amish Mennonites living in a certain part of Pennsylvania.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.520]   I remember the first time I ever saw any of them.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.080]   I was astounded, being driven in a car to see people coming along in a sort of horse-drawn
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:28.160]   vehicle, a very old-fashioned kind of buggy, I think they used to call it.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   And they were dressed in an extraordinary manner.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   And I said, "Well, what are those?"
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.160]   Well, they said, "They're some of the Amish people."
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:39.320]   And I heard of them, and they are a branch of the Mennonites, and they live in a community
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.080]   Now, let me tell you something about the Mennonites.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   They are there tonight.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.800]   They're quite a well-known group of people.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.280]   Here are some of the things that they hold.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.380]   This is their great text, "Be not conformed to this world."
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.480]   And this is how they interpret it.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.640]   They say, "You must never put curtains up on your windows.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.240]   That's to be worldly."
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.680]   The Christian doesn't put curtains up in his windows.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:11.120]   As regards the dress of the men, they are to wear black baggy trousers and large black
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.560]   broad-brimmed hats, and they do so.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.240]   To do anything else, they regard as worldly.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.480]   They say, "It is sinful and worldly to have your photographs taken."
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:28.640]   Still more so, of course, to put it up in a frame in a room in your house.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.920]   They do not believe in the use of motor cars.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.600]   Now, this is it, you see.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.560]   A motor car is worldliness.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.840]   This is what the world has produced, motor cars.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.640]   There were no motor cars in the 16th century.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.240]   This is a part of this worldliness that's come in this internal combustion engine.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.600]   So they don't use motor cars.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.800]   That isn't quite right.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:57.360]   Some of them, a section of them, are prepared to use motor cars only to go to a place of
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.680]   worship.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.760]   Incidentally they don't have buildings like this, they worship in one another's houses.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.800]   But if you happen to live a long way from the house where the worship is held, you are
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.120]   allowed to use a motor car.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.840]   But listen, is this credible?
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.480]   This is a fact.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.360]   If you do have a motor car, you must not have rubber tires on it.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:23.640]   Well, all right, my friend, all right, I want you to see this principle.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:31.080]   This is something which is believed and practiced by very honest people who are trying not to
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.440]   conform to this world.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.760]   You mustn't use rubber tires.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.680]   And another interesting thing.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:45.120]   If you find you have a car which has got chromium-plated parts to it, you must cover over the chromium
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.120]   either with black tape or with paint.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.720]   Chromium is showiness, it's worldliness.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.520]   So they literally cover it over.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.720]   They're most of them farmers.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:04.920]   But they do not use a tractor or any petrol-driven implement in their farming.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.480]   All that they say is a part of the world.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:13.160]   It's a part of this change that has come in, this lack of morality, this moral degradation,
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   modern America.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.200]   It's a part of it, this tractor business.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:22.400]   No, no, you must only plough the land with a horse, with horses drawing the ploughs.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.320]   You must not use this internal combustion engine at all.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.900]   And in the same way, they use no electricity.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:36.800]   Not only do they not have television sets and radio sets, they don't even have telephones.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.160]   Now I wonder how some of you stand about that.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.200]   Some of you don't believe in television sets.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.440]   But you know, if you're going to be really logical in this matter, you shouldn't have
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.880]   a telephone either.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:50.240]   They don't have telephones, because you see, it's worked by electricity, as is your television
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   set.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:58.200]   But this is exactly the thing that is being practiced by these Amish Mennonites at this
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   present time.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.680]   Now, that's only one example.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:06.080]   I knew a man, a very godly man, let me say this, one of the most godly men I have ever
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.400]   known, I've ever met.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:14.420]   He told me that as a young man, he passed through this phase of legalism.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.240]   And the form he took in his case was this.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   I can't remember whether I've told you before.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.280]   But he literally did this for a long time.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:28.880]   He said it was wrong to do anything on Sunday, which you could do the night before.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.760]   So he used to put his boots on and tie them up on Saturday night and sleep in them.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.720]   Very well, all right, you're laughing at this.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.960]   And perhaps you're doing the right thing.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.280]   All I want you to see is this, that the danger confronting some of us is not the danger of
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.880]   conformity to the world, but swinging so violently against that in a spirit of fear that we become
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:40:00.240]   sheer legalists, which, remember, is equally bad and condemned in the New Testament in
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   so many places.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.880]   But let me go on.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.600]   The next danger that I would describe is that of Phariseeism.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.000]   What's the difference between legalism and Phariseeism?
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.320]   There isn't much, except that in the case of the Pharisee, you put more emphasis upon
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   the spirit.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.840]   The Mennonites, let me say this for them, are a humble people.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.960]   I don't think I would describe these Amish Mennonites as Pharisees.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.960]   I think they're misguided.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   They're badly instructed.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   But I wouldn't call them Pharisees.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:33.320]   Incidentally, I ought to have told you this about them.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.920]   I said the majority of them were farmers.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.240]   And this is one of these interesting things, you see, that the devil does with us.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.360]   He'll isolate one thing, and he'll make us concentrate on that, and we'll be absolutely
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   clear about that.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.040]   Yes, but we won't be equally clear on other things.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:57.680]   It is a simple fact that most of them in their farms are tobacco growers, and are doing very
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.640]   well indeed out of growing tobacco.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.560]   They don't smoke it, but they grow it and they make money out of it.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.000]   You see what the devil does with us.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.600]   And he drives us to extremes, and we have ceased to be biblical in our thinking.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   Where is there anything in the scripture that condemns the use of electricity or the internal
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   combustion engine?
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.840]   You see, that's not biblical.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.520]   That's prejudice.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.640]   That's really allowing a tradition.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.640]   You see, we've always been like this.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.400]   This has only come in in the last century.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.440]   Therefore it must of necessity be wrong.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.280]   Now that's not biblical any longer.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.840]   Well, now, Phariseeism is different in this sense, that it's more a matter of the spirit,
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.840]   and it is mainly a matter of pride.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.600]   It's a matter of self-centeredness.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   It's a matter of self-satisfaction.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:54.920]   "I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men are, and especially this publican."
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:00.240]   If that's your attitude to what you call worldliness, you're in as bad a position as the worldly
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.520]   Christian, quite as bad.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   The other characteristic of the Pharisee always, of course, is censoriousness.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:19.120]   And the moment you and I become censorious, we are hopelessly in transgression at this
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:24.960]   other extreme, which is so far removed from conforming to this world.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:30.120]   And then, the fourth danger is the danger, of course, of the people who have not heeded
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.680]   this injunction at all.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.520]   It is the danger of what is called antinomianism.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.520]   And I think there's a great deal of this at the present time.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:46.160]   It's the opposite of the poor Amish Mennonites and many others amongst us.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.600]   This you see is just again a reaction.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:58.360]   In other words, you conform to this world if you want to live a life that is as near
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.440]   as you can get to the world without actually sinning.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.080]   That's the worldly mind and outlook.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.400]   It shows where your heart is.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.600]   That's something that is condemned completely by this injunction.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:16.000]   Or, it may be, and I've known Christians in this position who are not concerned about
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.280]   their conduct at all, but their attitude was that saved, all right, once a man's saved,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   always saved, doesn't matter what you do.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.360]   That's sheer antinomianism.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.640]   And it's always ready to raise its ugly head.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:37.760]   But perhaps the most subtle form of antinomianism, and to me the most contemptible form, is the
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:46.120]   form that conforms to the world but uses as a pretext its concern about evangelism.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:51.040]   So it teaches its women to use lipstick and so on, in order that they may make Christianity
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:56.000]   attractive to the people who are not Christians in the world.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Isn't it subtle?
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.520]   Oh, how subtle is the devil.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:05.960]   It's conforming to the world, it's a form of worldliness, but which masquerades as a
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.000]   great desire to evangelize.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.320]   I don't think the use of lipstick has ever been responsible for the salvation of a single
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.720]   soul.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:20.040]   The world expects us to be different, my dear friends, and we must be very careful of these
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:26.400]   specious excuses suggested to us by the devil to allow us to do the thing we really want
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   to do.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.840]   That's the terrible thing.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.760]   What then are we to do?
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.280]   Well, you see, again, I can't give you detailed instructions, I can only put principles before
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   you.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   Here's the great overriding principle.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.040]   Don't love them.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.800]   If you've got any love for the world as defined and the things of the world, you're already
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   wrong.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:59.760]   Secondly, avoid all appearance of evil, which means avoid every appearance of evil.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.840]   Take what I read to you from Ephesians 5 at the beginning.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:07.520]   There are certain things that we all know are wrong, and they're denounced in the Bible
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.480]   itself, and we are told not to do them.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.760]   Well, very well, there must be no argument about this, we just must not do them.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.320]   If we do, we are conforming to this world.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:21.920]   Where it is plainly laid down, and it is clearly sinful, the Christian mustn't even consider
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920]   the thing.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.920]   He rejects it.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   But let's go on.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:33.800]   "Let us not be governed by the world or molded by the world."
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   What do I mean by that?
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.880]   Well, I'm using the modern phraseology for the sake of brevity.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:46.120]   If there is any desire in you to be with it, as it's called, that's conforming to the world.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:51.720]   I don't care what form it takes, any desire to just be there, modern man, up to date,
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.080]   and so on, that's always of the devil.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.920]   That is conformity to the world, whether it's in your dress or appearance, or in your articles
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.000]   that you write, or anything else.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.040]   There's nothing more tragic to me than the feeble and pathetic attempt of certain journals
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.040]   to be with it.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.040]   They're modernizing themselves.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.240]   It's very pathetic, apart from being wrong.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   Then another way is this.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.760]   We must never be governed by the fashions of this world.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.880]   Is there anything more ludicrous about the world than its fashions?
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.880]   Show and ostentation.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.440]   Lust for the flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of life.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.760]   That's the characteristic of the world.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.960]   It's always a matter of show and of ostentation.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:42.440]   And look at the ridiculous extremes to which it goes in its so-called fashions.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:48.160]   There is no doubt that at the present time, fashion is being governed by a cult of ugliness.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.920]   It was once the cult of beauty.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.800]   It's obviously now the cult of ugliness.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.880]   That's the latest thing.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.120]   You make yourself as ugly as you can.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.880]   Once upon a time, it was the fashion to be clean.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:05.440]   It is obviously the fashion now, with the people, to be dirty and unwashed.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.600]   That's fashion.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.360]   Once there was the most elaborate hairstyle.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.720]   It's now the extreme opposite.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.280]   Now that's the world, you see.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.800]   And what I'm saying is that you must never be conformed to this.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.680]   Fashions in men in the same way.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.960]   I remember forty years ago, men wearing very white trousers.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.560]   You see what they're doing today, the exact opposite.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.160]   And so on, with all these things.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.560]   That's the world, and how ridiculous it is.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.720]   And I'm saying that when we are told, "Be not conformed to this world," it means this.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.840]   We mustn't be governed or molded by that sort of thing.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.000]   Now let me be fair.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   I know it's difficult.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.920]   People say, "But I've got to buy what's in the shops."
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.560]   I agree with you.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.800]   It is difficult, not up to a certain point, to have to conform to that.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   And you're a helpless victim and you can't help it.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.200]   All I'm saying is this, that you not only object to having to do that, but that you
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.640]   don't want to do that.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.760]   Conforming to the world is the desire to do that.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.400]   Or let me put it in another form.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:10.120]   If ever you find you're governed by a spirit of fear and public opinion, you are conforming
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.640]   to this world.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.240]   If you're thinking, "How is this going to affect me?
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.280]   Is this going to affect me adversely?"
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.880]   And if you're conforming to society and its fashions and its ways simply because you're
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.600]   in a spirit of fear, you really are conforming to the world.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   Then, "What are your rules?" says someone.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:32.000]   "Well, I can't give you detailed rules, but I'll put it like this.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.080]   We must avoid all that.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.160]   We must avoid all extremes."
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.680]   I would say to the Christian, "Never be aggressive in any sense."
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.440]   You know you can be aggressive even in your non-conformity to the world, but you must
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.840]   never be aggressive.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.480]   The Christian is never aggressive.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.680]   Or let me put it in another form.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.960]   Never parade.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   Never parade on any side.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.560]   Don't parade in a fashion parade, but don't parade in the opposite either.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.600]   Never parade.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.680]   Never make a parade of yourself.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.500]   It was the Pharisees who made broad their phylacteries.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.360]   It was the Pharisee who always sent a trumpeter ahead of him that the whole world might know
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.360]   what he was doing.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.920]   And if you are always announcing that you're not conforming to the world, I say you are
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.800]   conforming to the world in a very subtle way.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.760]   The Christian should never parade in any sense.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.240]   He should never be aggressive.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.280]   "Well, what then?"
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:36.760]   "Well, what the Christian does is always to be an expression of his new character.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.800]   That's all he's concerned about.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.440]   The Christian is a man who knows what he's doing and he knows why he's doing it."
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.360]   Do you know there ought to be something almost instinctive about the Christian in this matter
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.100]   of not conforming to the world?
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.800]   I can't recall again whether I've ever told you this before.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:58.400]   But I was an eyewitness of it and it always struck me as being such a perfect illustration.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:03.320]   I knew a man who was converted out of a terrible life of drunkenness and many other terrible
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.280]   things, much worse even than drunkenness.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:13.560]   But the great feature of this man was his extraordinary mustaches, unusual length.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.880]   And he told me, and many others told me the same thing, that this man had often thought
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.880]   over this question.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.840]   And men would challenge him in a semi-drunken condition as to whether he had got wider span
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.160]   of mustaches than he had.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.280]   And they thought about this and had half killed one another many a time.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   Well, this man was converted.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.400]   And I remember a few weeks after his conversion, he was attending a weeknight service.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.360]   I was standing at the door and they all passed me on the way out.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.280]   I saw this man coming with no mustaches.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.080]   And I was most annoyed.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.560]   I felt sure that some busy buggy in the church had told him to shave off his mustaches.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.800]   So when he came to me, I said, "Who told you to get rid of your mustaches?
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   Nobody is."
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.120]   "Now come along," I said, "don't you shield anybody.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.680]   I don't like this sort of thing.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.640]   I don't like these self-appointed detectives in the church.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.800]   Tell me, who told you?"
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.520]   "I want to know because I want to correct this person."
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.760]   He said, "Nobody told me to do it."
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.440]   "Well," I said, "why did you do it?"
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   He said, "I'll tell you."
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.280]   He said, "I did it this morning."
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.880]   He said, "I was getting up this morning and I had a wash," he said, "and as I was drying
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.800]   myself, I happened to see myself in the mirror and I saw the mustaches.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.440]   And I said to myself," he said, "them things don't belong to a Christian.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.080]   So I got hold of a scissors and I cut them off and shaved the rest."
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.480]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.880]   There's something instinctive in the Christian.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.080]   He has a feeling.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.000]   He knows there is something that tells him.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.280]   You know, there's a good text for this, isn't there?
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:44.560]   Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ, Philippians 1, 27.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   That's the test.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.920]   Is it becoming?
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.320]   Does it fit in well?
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:54.120]   Does it match this glorious gospel that I profess to believe?
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:59.240]   And the Christian, I say, has got this instinctively in him so he doesn't parade, he doesn't announce,
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:05.760]   he doesn't call his stomperter, but he just wants everything about himself to be in conformity
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.680]   with this great and glorious gospel that he believes.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.800]   So the great characteristic of the Christian always is moderation.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.440]   He's never at any extreme.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:21.120]   The Christian in his dress is never showy, but let me say this equally, he or she should
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.480]   never be dowdy either.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:27.920]   For a Christian to dress in a dowdy manner is as bad as to dress in a showy manner, because
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.480]   if you do dress in a dowdy manner, you're calling attention.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.840]   It's a trumpeter, it's a parade.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.760]   You're attracting attention to yourself, and the Christian is one who doesn't want to attract
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.400]   in this way at all.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.220]   He simply wants to attract in a Christian way.
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.040]   He wants his character to attract.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:49.460]   So he doesn't do it in these external forms on either extreme.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:54.800]   So I would say that the Christian in this matter of dress particular is always neat
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.000]   and tidy, and that's something we can all be.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   You avoid all extremes.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.680]   It's neat, it's tidy, it's not obtrusive, it's not offensive in any sense at all, and
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.600]   there's none of this horrible element of parade in connection with it.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:19.080]   The Christian, in other words, is always inoffensive, and he is the man who bears the witness.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.160]   Take for instance this alcoholic drink question.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.800]   There's a way of doing that that does much more harm than good, but the true Christian
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.600]   does it in an inoffensive manner.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.820]   He does it, if you like, in a gentlemanly manner.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.480]   He doesn't parade it, he doesn't hold up a placard, he doesn't announce it, he doesn't
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   get his trumpeter to call attention.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.120]   No, he does it quietly.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.320]   Men look at him and they say there's something different about that man.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.400]   They have to ask him to explain what it is.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.600]   That's the way not to conform to the world.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.160]   That is the way to bear your testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ and what he has done
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.840]   for you in his great and glorious salvation.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.600]   I can't get nearer definition than that.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.320]   That's the rule.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.040]   Only let your conversation, the whole of your life, demeanor, department, everything, only
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:16.520]   let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.440]   You're not a worldling, but you're not a crank either.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.920]   Christian cranks have always done more harm than good.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.360]   The Christian is neither, but he's a man of moderation.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.680]   He's like our blessed Lord himself.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:37.520]   He walked through this world often unrecognized and yet there was always something.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.840]   He couldn't be hidden, not because he made a show.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.320]   He didn't cry aloud in the streets, we are told, and yet he couldn't be hidden.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.080]   It would shine forth.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.480]   That's the ambition of the Christian.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:56.520]   As long as we are governed by that, we can be quite certain we shall not conform to this
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.520]   world.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.800]   Now next week, God willing, we'll go on to look at the positive aspect of all that
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.280]   as the apostle proceeds to put it.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.200]   We come to thee, our heavenly Father, and once more we thank thee for thy word.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:14.320]   O Lord, how can we thank thee sufficiently for it?
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:22.120]   Keep us, we pray thee, ever with a single eye to thy glory, ever to that simplicity
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.040]   which is in Christ.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:32.080]   Lord, keep us there and give us one desire, and that is to tell forth the glories and
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.160]   the wonders of thy grace.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:41.280]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:49.040]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and throughout
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:56.960]   the remainder of this hour short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and until we
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:05.560]   shall see him as he is and shall find ourselves without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:11.760]   but even as he is himself and like unto him.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.320]   Amen.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:17.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
