[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.080]   Welcome, friends, to this Every Day Educator podcast.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.000]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.120]   And I am glad to spend some time today with you, my fellow educators,
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.440]   as we ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.520]   As always, I want to encourage you to check out all the great offerings
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.720]   on CC Connected and on our podcast channel.

[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.800]   Well, listeners, I'm happy to welcome you to another episode of the Every Day Educator podcast.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.280]   We are continuing with our series, Lessons from Down the Road.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.160]   You know, as a young homeschooler, lots of times I wished that I had somebody
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.560]   to ask about my burning questions, somebody who was farther down the road than I was,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.200]   who had a little bit of experience under their belt, somebody whose brain I could
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.520]   pick just for a minute or two. And so in this series, we are offering some wisdom
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.080]   from fellow homeschoolers who are a little farther down the road.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.760]   Today I have with me one of my dearest friends from Classical Conversations,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.960]   Shelly Stockton. Shelly, I'm so excited to spend a little bit of time with you this morning.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.280]   Oh, thank you. It's good to be here, Lisa.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.400]   I do wish, Shelly, that we were on the screen porch together with a big cup of tea,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.160]   listening to the rain. But I guess this is the next best thing. And I know that our listeners
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.080]   are eager to hear what you have to share with us today. We want to talk today about how really
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.680]   and truly academics aren't everything, that there's a little something called life skills
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.160]   that we want to pass on to our children, too, just to set the context and to show people
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   that you do have the credentials to share with them. I want to ask you, Shelly, to share with us
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.440]   how long have you and Greg homeschooled and why did you begin homeschooling?
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.720]   Well, we homeschooled for 25 years and our youngest twins graduated a couple of years ago.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.680]   Why did we begin? Well, I think our reason for homeschooling changes, which a lot of
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.240]   people's do as they do educate. So our situation was a little strange because when our oldest
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:07.360]   daughter was young, we just sat and read books to her all day. So she read very early and really,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.800]   she read so early that we just fell in love with education. And all I wanted to do is to
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   read good books with her, right? So a little selfish, I just wanted to keep her home and
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:29.360]   read books with her all day. So we started early on and then we kept homeschooling really by the
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.480]   grace of God because we wanted to learn alongside and just keep a good eye on our children's
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.760]   character as they grew up. Oh, that's great. You know, it's so funny, Shelly,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.640]   your experience mirrored ours a lot. Our oldest, I think her first word was book and she would go
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.840]   around all the time saying, read me this book. She was little, really little, read me this book.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.560]   And so we did. We read a lot of books. And like you, I just was a little jealous to see
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.640]   those light bulbs come on as she learned things. And I enjoyed that experience so much. I think
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.440]   I had a friend say, oh, you and your husband are such natural teachers, you're homeschooling,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.480]   you just don't even know it. She was a homeschooler and thought that we should consider
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:26.720]   that when our youngest or oldest was little. And so we were glad we did. And like you said, I think
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.640]   for a lot of us, the reasons that we keep homeschooling flex and change with time and
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:42.320]   sometimes don't you feel like, Shelly, it changes as we as the parents mature and as we grow and
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.000]   what we see is God's mandate for us? Absolutely. Yes. And He reveals new things to you and then
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.240]   your children change as well and they grow. So what they need and where you can direct them
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.640]   also changes. Yeah. So you said that what you loved to do with your oldest was to read and to
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.240]   share and to share the learning as you and your husband really liked learning with your children.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.080]   Was that your goal when your family started homeschooling, that you would learn together?
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   Did you have formal academic goals in the beginning?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.360]   Well, I think our goals when we first started homeschooling was just to survive the day.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yes, we can probably all resonate with that. Also, I really wanted to learn to love learning
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.320]   instead of just seeing it as some undesirable task to get through. Oh, cool. I prayed a lot
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.960]   as I'm sure you did as well, Lisa, in those early years for God just to help me love what I ought to
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.440]   love and to get to a point where we would enjoy subjects that even those subjects that were
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.880]   difficult for us. So we really wanted to weave learning into our normal lives.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.400]   So did we have formal academic goals in the beginning? Probably not really in the elementary
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:17.520]   years. We wanted our girls to fall in love with books and explore the woods outside of our house
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:28.320]   and just be curious. Yes, be curious. We valued being curious, too, as young parents. We actually
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:38.880]   loved it when our girls asked us questions that seemed odd or beyond their years or sometimes
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:49.360]   impertinent to other people. They were curious about everything. And because we liked exploring
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:58.320]   alongside of them, and we liked framing the explanations that would satisfy their little minds,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.680]   we reveled in the questions. But we discovered that there were other people who were discomfited
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:14.160]   by our girls' questions. I can remember one time when a single—well, she wasn't single. She was
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.200]   married, but she didn't have any kids—came to a Bible study at our home. My husband's a pastor.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:28.240]   This gal came to our house to Bible study. As she was leaving, our oldest daughter was following her
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:37.440]   down the sidewalk. She said, "Ms. Kim, what is slavery?" Kim had no context that we had been
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.520]   reading about the Underground Railroad from a library book that we had gotten. She did not
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   know what to say to this little five-year-old person about slavery. I discovered that other
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:00.000]   people were not as welcoming of the questions stage of life as we were. But yeah, our goals
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.360]   kind of mirrored yours, that we wanted to encourage that kind of curiosity and encourage
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:16.240]   the natural questions. I think that you're right. A lot of us, Shelly, especially with elementary
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.960]   aged or even preschool children, we don't have academic goals that go beyond, "I want you to
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.440]   love books," or "I want you to learn how to read," or "I want you to learn your numbers and your
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:40.240]   shapes and your colors." I do remember thinking, "I want you to build a strong base of general
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.080]   knowledge." This is before we found Classical Conversations. I was reading the Well-Trained
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:53.280]   Mind and a lot of classical ed books. That whole broad foundation and memorize a lot of stuff to
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:04.240]   get you prepared to think deeper thoughts resonated with me. But those kind of general goals were what
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:12.160]   I had before we found CC. Now, once we found Classical Conversations, I had some more concrete
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.840]   goals. What about you? How did becoming part of a Classical Conversations community give some form
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:27.360]   or structure to your homeschooling? Yes. Well, our original plan was we were going to enter the
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.840]   girls into a Christian school when our youngest children became school-aged. I would just hopefully
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.800]   find a teaching role or something in the school. But then I met Lee early in the days of CC when
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.840]   our oldest was in fifth grade and our youngest twins were three. Lee sat down and showed me the
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.320]   Classical Conversations scope and sequence. We fell in love. Greg and I pored over that scope
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:01.840]   and sequence. God just began to open our eyes to really expand our vision of education. It was okay
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:10.640]   to have early goals to be different. Now he was growing us in our vision. It also resonated with
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:17.360]   us that classical home education just seemed to be the best preparation we could give our children.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:26.400]   The methods really embraced the child's nature. They emphasized skills over job training
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.920]   and offered this broad perspective with this Christ-centered worldview.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:42.000]   We thought it just looked very doable. Yes, those are the same things that
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.840]   drew us into Classical Conversations too. It wasn't just that the scope and sequence was
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.720]   really sound academically. I do know when we first saw the scope and sequence, my husband
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.960]   was really impressed with the junior high and high school level scope and sequence. He was like,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:09.840]   "Man, this is so amazing. These kids are going to have what we had as sophomores in college
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.440]   when they're still in high school. This is an excellent education."
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:22.240]   But the deeper we went and the more we walked along and the more we learned about, as you said,
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   the classical model and how it really takes into account the nature of the child and the skills
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.840]   that can be grown at all those different developmental stages, we were won over.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:47.040]   But what really captured our hearts was the Christ-centered nature of education. The whole
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:55.280]   idea that the purpose of education is to know God more deeply through what He's made and what He's
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:05.920]   done and what He's shared with us, that really resonated. It helped us to fold our non-academic
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:15.440]   goals for our girls into our broader education plans. I wanted to ask you, what are the other
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:24.480]   goals that you had for your home school? Or did you even consider these non-academic goals that
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:32.400]   they even belong to the realm of school? Did you have non-academic goals that you folded in?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.640]   Well, of course, like many parents, we wanted our children to have time together.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:48.400]   We wanted them to become kind, integrous humans. We wanted them to learn to ask forgiveness
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.240]   regularly and just be able to give forgiveness regularly. And the skill for which we had many
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:02.880]   opportunities to practice with five daughters. We just wanted to have time for family devotions
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   and to instill a dependency of God and His Word with our children. We knew the academics would
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.720]   come along as we were diligent and learned ourselves. But we really wanted to give lots
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:21.600]   of room and space for them to grow in the Lord. That's awesome. That's awesome.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:33.680]   And you said you had five daughters. So as a mom, did you have homemaking goals or
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.720]   business goals, or what other skills did you want to grow into your daughters
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:49.840]   when they were little? And did you realize when they were small that there were things like
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:59.920]   meal planning or laundry or wise shopping that needed to be skills that you were honing while
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:06.720]   you were teaching them to read and do arithmetic? Well, with five kids at home, of course,
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.240]   cleaning bathrooms and doing their own laundry was really important. It was right up there.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:22.960]   We tried to model the importance of attending church and just serving others outside of
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.760]   yourself. And we called it looking beyond the end of your own nose, looking beyond yourself,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:38.080]   and then respectfully listening to others just who don't agree with you. Thinking orderly was
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.200]   important when you make decisions and just being content at home, being happy to be at home.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:50.720]   Oh, wow. Those are good. Like you said earlier, those are good character building
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.640]   skills and practices that you want to give your children opportunities to stretch themselves in.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.280]   You know, being content with what you have and being content with your circumstances
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:14.320]   is something that will take our children farther than being fluid in Spanish.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:25.360]   That is a life skill that a lot of us maybe did not consider on the intentional
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.600]   list of subjects to be covered. But I know for us, as our children got older,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:40.480]   we put more attention into developing their character, their godly habits.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:48.240]   As we saw, how important that is for peaceful living within a family, right?
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.320]   Yes, you get lots of practice.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.880]   Yes, you get so much practice.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:58.000]   I don't think I taught any of my younger children besides the first one how to tie their own shoes,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.840]   you know, because the oldest does that. So there's lots of organic things that happen when you're
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.240]   home together that maybe you didn't write on a list somewhere, but they're happening and children
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.880]   are learning to serve each other. And one of the things that I learned from another mom once is
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.840]   that when two children would have a little rift or a little argument, have each of the children
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:29.360]   go clean the other child's room. Just things like that.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.880]   What a lovely habit. That's a great idea.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.840]   Motivation to be nice next time.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:45.200]   Right, right, right. Isn't that interesting? That's great. That's great. As you look back,
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.320]   Shelly, what would you consider your successes as a homeschool mom?
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.080]   And what do you think contributed to your success?
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.000]   Well, we certainly did not home educate perfectly, if there is such a thing.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.400]   Right. I have given up. Yeah.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:12.160]   Our daughters worked and learned and played together a lot. They often sought their siblings
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.720]   input as they completed projects and assignments alongside each other.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.160]   That's neat.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.960]   So, of course, it's easier for your mind to think back and think, what did I not do well, right?
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   Absolutely.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.960]   Now that they're all in their 20s, I love that they still value their sister's opinions on
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.200]   whatever they're working on, college papers or work issues. They seek each other's advice and help.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:45.680]   So I guess the success is that we just did life together. And as a result, you know,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:51.600]   we have those happy stories to laugh about. And we also have those stories of struggle
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:59.040]   and failure that humble us. And honestly, those stories are probably mean regularly told more
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.240]   often with the end in mind to keep us humble.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:13.120]   Yes, absolutely. Yeah. I don't offer you guys up as farther down the road and therefore perfect.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.400]   As much as I do to help our listeners see that, yes, we might be farther down the road,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:25.040]   but we took a lot of detours and a lot of wrong turns, maybe, or we stepped in the muck at the
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:31.920]   edge of the past a lot of times. But we kept going. And we're still alive to tell about it.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.400]   Yes, we're alive to tell the stories and our children are alive to tell the stories. And
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:45.280]   sometimes I look back and I tell people that our biggest success is that our children still
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:52.000]   like to be with us. Our children still like to be together. Our girls, like you said,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.200]   seek each other out for advice and fellowship. And our kids still come home. I mean,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.600]   my daughters are 27 and 25, and they still call home and say, "Now, when is family vacation?"
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:14.800]   Because that still means all of us all together. And I love the successes that we still talk about
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:22.560]   big ideas and we still talk about what we've read and we still talk about what's going on and where
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:29.280]   do we see the truth and how can we find the truth and how can we sift through all of this information
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:37.040]   and how can we help each other think about things. And so that, to me, is a success.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:45.840]   Yeah, I think that classical homeschooling, it is simple. It's not easy, but it is simple. And
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.480]   there's a difference. I think one thing we did is we were just consistent. We didn't change
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:59.360]   curriculums every year and get fearful that the fruit wasn't coming soon enough. And to be honest,
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:06.000]   those CC parent practicums helped tremendously in that. We just simply prepared and plotted
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.320]   and prayed and just kept moving forward in God's grace. But it's hard to take credit for any
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.480]   success, because when you get to that, finished with that thing, you realize it's really the
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:29.920]   mercies of God that have kept you and have brought you this far. So we look back and we see so many
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:36.640]   times where He really just carried us when we lacked the knowledge or the patience or the
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:44.960]   diligence. Most weeks I would write some Bible verse or admonishment on the board, something like,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.800]   "Do not grow weary in doing good," or "Love a patient in kind." And it was funny because the
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   girls years later were talking about that, and they thought I wrote those on the board for them,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   but it was really for me. I needed as much encouragement and carrying from God as they did.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:15.200]   Yes, I know. And sometimes they, you're right, they did not always realize that we were fellow
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:24.800]   strugglers on the homeschool journey. And I look back and I see that the Lord used the homeschooling
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:35.920]   of my children as a refining tool for me. It taught me to trust Him. It taught me patience.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.280]   Not that I have arrived, but it was a continual teaching of the Spirit.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.600]   A sanctification of sorts.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:54.800]   Yes, yes, absolutely. Absolutely. So those are awesome life skills that we have been taught
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:03.280]   by the Spirit and that hopefully our children have been taught within the confines of our homeschool.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.400]   What other practical life skills, Shelly, did you try to teach your girls?
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.960]   Did you teach them to cook? Did you teach them to grocery shop or to sew?
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.840]   That's true. Yeah, they did come to the grocery store with me a lot. And we did,
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.000]   at some point, I kind of gave that over to them.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.840]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.360]   And they all did their laundry early. I would give them a budget. One thing fun we did is
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:38.400]   there used to be a show where you would give a budget and you would try to redo a room for
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:45.200]   a certain amount. So we gave our girls a budget and we said, "Okay, this room in the basement is
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:53.760]   yours to redo." And so they tiled, they bought the tile and actually went to tile. They painted the
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:03.840]   doors, added some baseboards and just made this room into like a family room downstairs on a
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.040]   budget. So that was a fun project. We still laugh about it as we look, the tile's still there.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.760]   So we look back at it and we thought, "Oh yeah, yeah, 12-year-olds did that, we can tell."
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:24.800]   Right, right. How fun. That's a great learning activity. Wow, and you empowered them.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:32.720]   And I can imagine that they felt really important that you guys trusted them to do that.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.640]   What confidence building that had to be. It was pretty fun.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:46.240]   Yeah. Okay, if you look back, are there any life skills that you realized as your daughters grew
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:55.600]   up and maybe moved on or moved out that they had not internalized as well? Were there any
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:04.720]   deficiencies that you discovered in your homeschool so far as practical life skills came?
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.640]   Well, when I think about the question, "What do you wish you'd had done differently?"
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.880]   The first thing that comes to mind is maybe more governing principles, I guess.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:23.520]   More trust. I wish I trusted the process more and maybe played more.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.800]   I wish I had taken on less stress and less worry, not taken the whole thing so seriously as if it
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:41.360]   all depended on me at the end of the day. But we found, and of course we all know, wrestling with
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.000]   a subject that is difficult is sanctifying and healthy. Wrestling, being at home, being content
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.920]   at home, doing life differently than your neighbors do. It's sanctifying and it's difficult, but it's
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:01.760]   also healthy. It's part of growing. Ultimately, I think I came to a point, I needed to rest in
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:08.640]   the fact that God's yoke is easy and His burden is light. And I think that homeschooling parents
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.720]   will do well as they think about all the things they need to teach their children or should teach
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.240]   their children or maybe aren't teaching their children. We just need to take a big breath and
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:27.440]   remind ourselves that this whole burden of educating and keeping our children alive and
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:34.000]   as well as making sure they get a good job and can actually feed themselves when they leave.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.320]   Right, right, right.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.040]   God has created them for a purpose and He's not going to abandon that purpose just because we
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.640]   didn't drill Latin pronouns or teach them to separate, you know, colds and darks and the
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:53.200]   laundry correctly, right? So He's going to open the doors of opportunity for our children. But
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:00.720]   I was sort of resting in this fact when we went to, recently this summer, to a college visitation
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:07.840]   with one of our daughters. And they don't have the meal plan there. All the rooms are with full
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:14.000]   kitchens. And so one of the professors said, or whoever's leading the event said, "This is the
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.040]   time to teach your kids how to cook." And my daughter and I looked at each other, you know,
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:26.080]   she'd been cooking for six years. So if you're learning two months before college, that might
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:33.440]   be difficult. But so just being part of home and letting them pursue and learn what they're
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:41.120]   interested in as far as the life skills, I think is helpful.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.400]   Yeah, I think there's a lot of wisdom, Shelley, in what you've said about teaching your children
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.960]   to do these tasks when they're young and at home. You alluded to your daughter had been cooking for
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.880]   six years. So she, you know, you began to teach her to do her own laundry and to cook for the
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:08.800]   family when she was 12 or 13 years old. And so she had plenty of time to practice those skills
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:17.280]   so that they became good habits by the time she would have to depend on herself to do that.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:26.640]   And I think that a lot of us as parents do for our children what they could do for themselves
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:32.240]   if we would only teach them. And sometimes I looked back as my daughters got older,
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.600]   I looked back and realized that some of the things they did not know how to do
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:46.960]   well was because I had done it for them, either in service to them or, frankly, because it was
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.800]   easier for me to do it. I could get it done faster than to watch them fumble through a task.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:59.200]   But, you know, I came to the end of our older daughters as she was getting almost ready to
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:08.240]   graduate, and I realized that there were things that she was still a novice at, and it was more
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.000]   my fault than her fault. I mean, you know, she was willing to let mama do all the work that mama
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.800]   would do, but I had not shifted the responsibilities. And so, listeners, I would encourage
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:28.640]   you to be practical in some of the things that you teach in your homeschool, whether that is
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:39.200]   budgeting or cooking or home repair or, you know what, how to talk to somebody on the telephone,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:46.320]   how to make an appointment on the telephone, how to handle a discrepancy in a checking
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:53.920]   account at a bank. So all of these are practical life skills that are easier for us as parents to
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.960]   handle on behalf of our children, unless we realize that our children are going to grow up
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:06.080]   and go out of our homes, maybe not confident in being able to handle that on their own.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.480]   So that's an encouragement from me.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:17.360]   MJ: Yeah, and maybe if we want to call this a life skill, I think it really is a life skill.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.040]   And many would agree that, you know, just keeping a habit of regular Bible study and prayer.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.280]   That is a life skill, and it cannot be overstated.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.720]   I think that that one habit really nurtures all areas of life. I didn't learn that skill
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.760]   till college. I remember a college professor challenging, I went to a Christian college,
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:43.920]   challenging me to do this, and I remember how difficult it was. So just being disciplined to
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:50.880]   do what God puts in front of you to the best of your ability and being aware of your own failings
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:30:00.000]   without dwelling on them, asking God for mercy. These are the things that parents can model and
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.200]   allow for their children to participate in.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:13.280]   GW: Yeah, that's great, Shelley. And, you know, for whatever reason, a lot of us compartmentalize
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:19.680]   and homeschool is supposed to be academic skills and maybe some practical skills.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:26.320]   But yes, you've helped us to remember that these spiritual disciplines should also be part of our
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:35.360]   homeschools, because those are the strengths that will truly carry us as adults into adulthood that
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:43.200]   will make our lives what God intends for them to be, far more than Latin or a science research
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.040]   paper or a history timeline.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:56.720]   So looking back, because your girls went through the challenge program, how did their CC studies
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:04.400]   help build life skills as well as academic skills? You talked about the skill of listening,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:13.360]   the skill of weighing decisions. How did the CC studies help build those skills in your girls?
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.560]   CT: Well, you know, we memorize a lot in foundations, and that's a lot of skill.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:25.440]   How many things do we still have to remember and hold on to as a mother and as a working adult?
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:34.160]   So memorizing, just paying attention, being curious, and learning alongside people of various
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:40.800]   ages, doing life with people of various ages, not just being comfortable around people that are like
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:48.400]   me, but learning to communicate with those people who are not like me. But you know,
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.560]   those challenge themes of ownership, what are they? Ownership, discipline, freedom,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:59.840]   noble choices, consequences of leadership. They're woven into six years of assignments,
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:06.480]   and they're excellent preparation for just being a good human, a God-centric person.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:16.320]   AC: Yeah, yeah. The time that our students spend in community is so valuable for practicing the
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:22.720]   fruits of the Spirit. Living in community, we all know that. Living in the community of our homes
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:30.560]   is a way to practice mercy, right, and patience, and kindness, and gentleness. But living in
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:36.720]   community and having our challenge students in community with one another, where the whole goal
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:45.360]   is to wrestle with ideas, and to take the point and the counterpoint, and to debate one another,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:54.800]   and to push against one another, but to learn how to do that with kindness and with tolerance
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:04.880]   in the best sense. I am being quiet and respectfully listening and open-mindedly considering
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:12.560]   what you have to say so that we can wrestle together and perhaps learn from one another.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.520]   That is a mind-blowingly valuable skill in the world today.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.560]   AC: Yes. Amen. AC: I just think that's good. And you know,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:31.120]   the skills that our students learn of research, of how to ask a good question and then go about
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:43.520]   finding respected resources to research that question and to find out the nuts and bolts,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.360]   pieces of information that will help us make a good decision. That's a life skill.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.120]   Those research skills really, I think, help our students.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:00.080]   CM: Yes, as well as the debate skills that you mentioned earlier, just learning to listen to
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:07.280]   the other side, and think orderly, and then not get emotional when somebody disagrees.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.520]   AC: Yes. CM: You know, to bring ethos into it as well,
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   and just thinking about the other side. You know, teaching our kids just to seek first the Kingdom
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.960]   and develop skills that make Him known, that's so important. But God will make room for their
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:33.440]   giftings, because He ultimately has a plan and a purpose for them. But one thing I try to remember
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:40.480]   is that just to empower your children to make, when appropriate, their own decisions. We don't
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.560]   make all our children's decisions for them now that they're adults, right? We're mentors. They
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:55.840]   come to ask us, but we do well, really, to entrust them to the Lord because He's omniscient
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.120]   and omnipresent, right? He's omnipotent, and He's all good. And I am not.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.080]   AC: Right, right. CM: So it really makes good logical sense to
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:13.600]   put all these things, put our children under His lordship, especially in the lives of our children.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:22.880]   AC: Very, very true. Okay, so we're coming to the end of our time together. And I know that
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:29.520]   some of our listeners are saying, "Okay, so you ladies are obviously done. Your children are done."
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:35.520]   Okay, here's what I have to say to you. Your children are never done. You're never done with
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:43.840]   your children because we have nurtured a family atmosphere of learning and a family reliance on
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:51.280]   one another to refine us and to help us. They're always going to come back. But how do you know,
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   Shelly, that some of your lessons took with your kids? How can you tell that some of these lessons
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:06.160]   that you tried to teach them, they really have held on to?
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:12.960]   SH: Yes, you just enjoy them. I just enjoy my little children so much. We can have conversations
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:22.000]   about things, and I see them turning into good people, people who love the Lord and who are
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.920]   growing in their virtue and just using the skills that they learned at home and in classical
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:37.200]   conversations to seek first the kingdom and to be good workers, to do things for all the glory of
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.520]   God. My son-in-law is working on a doctorate, and he gave me the biggest compliment this last
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:52.720]   weekend. He said that his wife's education, my daughter's education, really helps her to see
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:37:00.640]   things more broadly, like awareness of the past, awareness of the origins of where that thought
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:07.680]   came from. He said that she often integrates thoughts and ideas from many disciplines into
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:15.520]   conversations and decisions in a way that he felt like his education did not prepare him. He was a
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:24.480]   proponent now of homeschooling because of the way, just watching how she thinks. To me, that was a
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.280]   win. I'll take that, right? MJ: Absolutely. Yeah, that makes me
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:37.040]   want to give a big cheer. Yeah, that's awesome. SH: Just remembering that he has a plan and a
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:44.560]   purpose for our kids. It's not really up to us to make all of our decisions, all their decisions for
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:55.280]   them, because he has a plan for them. MJ: Yeah, yeah. They have been given to us
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:05.040]   from the Lord, but they are not our projects. I can remember thinking when my girls were little,
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:12.240]   and I felt so blessed that God had entrusted these little lives to me. I was so excited about
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:19.120]   what I could make of them, what I could help them to become, and the masterpiece that they could
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:27.440]   become. One day I was thinking those just ridiculous thoughts, and I felt the Lord saying,
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:38.080]   "Yeah, you have it wrong. You're not the artist. That child, she is a masterpiece,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:45.920]   but you're not the artist. Actually, you're the tool. You're the tool that I am using many times
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:52.480]   to chisel away something from their lives that they don't need."
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.360]   TG: And maybe vice versa too, Lisa. MJ: Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:04.080]   TG: Their struggles also sanctify us. I just wanted to say a word of encouragement to maybe
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:11.040]   the moms out there, the homeschooling parents who have a child that maybe they're wondering
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:19.920]   if he's going to make it or is struggling with something. Put it in the Lord's hand,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:27.360]   put it under His Lordship, and then do your diligence, and then let Him do the sanctification.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:40.720]   I don't know that there's a better lesson in how to trust the Lord by taking this responsibility
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:47.120]   of what He's given us, to love these kids and to direct them and teach them His ways,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:57.120]   and then to see perhaps sometimes our own sins magnified in them, our own failings magnified in
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:06.000]   them. And I tell you what, it has led me to my knees so many times. Just being aware that it's
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.680]   His work and that you have a part, but it's not all on your shoulders, and just give it to Him,
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:18.800]   put it under His Lordship. MJ: That is actually a beautiful encouragement,
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:28.160]   Shelly, something that we can all remember. It is very encouraging to know that it's not
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:37.360]   all up to us. It's not all in our hands. What's your biggest aha? As we come to the very end of
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:44.240]   our podcast, Shelly, what's your biggest aha from the journey? Or what's the last word that you would
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:52.640]   like to share in encouragement to these parents? SH: So I guess my final word would be to trust.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:41:00.800]   We talk about this in Challenge. Trust that the Holy Spirit is at work. Trust that there is truth
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   and it can be known. Trust that your child can learn the truth. I appreciate this quote by Matthew
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:17.440]   Henry. Reading authors from past encourage me, and so often I'll read a quote or read theologians or
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:24.720]   pastors. This Matthew Henry is from the late 1600s, and he writes this, "So that we may not
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:34.400]   complain of what is, let us see God's hand in all events. So that we may not be afraid of what shall
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:43.840]   be, let us see all events in His hands." So putting all things under His Lordship and in the Lord's
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:54.000]   hands is a good lesson for us to remember. AP: It absolutely is. It is absolutely. Academics
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.240]   aren't everything. What does God have for us to learn on this homeschool journey? Not just our
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:07.680]   children, but us as well. Shelly, thank you so much for sharing these lessons from down the road.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.920]   SHL: It was nice talking with you, Lisa. AP: Yeah, I enjoyed it. Listeners, I hope that you
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   feel encouraged, that you now maybe have a broader vision of what the Lord is calling you to in your
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:27.200]   family's homeschool journey. Thanks for joining us this week, and we'll see you again next week.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.600]   Bye-bye.
