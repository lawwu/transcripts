[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.760]   the passage which we read at the beginning, in the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:21.960]   chapter 15, verses 54 to 57, verses 54 to 57, in the 15th chapter of Paul's first epistle
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.520]   to the Corinthians, "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.920]   shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.760]   'Death is swallowed up in victory.'
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360]   O death, where is thy sting?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.200]   O grave, where is thy victory?
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.080]   The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law; but thanks be to God which
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.440]   giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.960]   Now it is people who really understand the meaning of that who sing that last hymn as
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.760]   it should be sung, and rejoice in doing so.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.360]   Very well, let us look at it together in order that we may see what it is that makes us as
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.040]   timorous mortals stand hesitant and shivering on the brink, instead of launching forth in
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.960]   faith to look at that land of pure delights where saints immortal reign.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.400]   What have we got in these verses that we are looking at?
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.040]   Well, they are the climax of this mighty chapter.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.140]   If you like, they are the summary of the argument that the apostle has been deploying and working
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.020]   out in the course of this long, unusually long and lengthy chapter.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.480]   He is bringing it all to an end; he is summing it up.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.400]   He is bringing it, I say, to a kind of grand climax and conclusion.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   What is it about?
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.520]   That is the question.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.720]   What is his argument?
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   What is he arguing about?
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.000]   What is he writing about?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.020]   And the answer is, of course, that it is about the resurrection of the body.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.720]   First and foremost, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ himself, literally, physically,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.300]   in the body.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:36.520]   And then, from that, the hope, the promise of the resurrection of our bodies also, eventually.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.700]   Now, that is the subject, that is the theme.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.500]   And it is important that we should be clear about that, clear that the argument of this
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.820]   epistle, clear that the argument of this particular day, Easter Sunday, which we thus observe,
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.940]   is that, and nothing less than that.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.300]   The message of Easter is not merely a message of some vague, general hope.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.000]   Spring coming, end of the winter, beginning of spring.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.480]   What a tragedy that people should interpret Easter as if it were but that.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.180]   Principle of resurrection in the whole of nature, flowers coming to life, seed that
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.600]   has been sown beginning to germinate and sprout.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.920]   That's it, they say.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.360]   The spirit of Easter, the spirit of hopefulness.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.240]   That's not the argument of this chapter.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.920]   That's not the Christian message.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:40.040]   Neither is it merely a reminder that there is, after all, a life after death.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.200]   It isn't merely a reminder of the truth, of the persistence of the soul beyond this
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.480]   life and beyond this world.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.880]   There are many who seem to think it's that, that the message of Easter and of the resurrection
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.200]   is that we go on living after we've gone out of this world.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.480]   I say it isn't that.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.000]   Neither is it just to say that the Lord Jesus Christ is still living in that unseen realm,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.720]   that he's alive there, and still in a way able to help us.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.920]   There are many who interpret Easter like that.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.640]   That's what they mean by the resurrectionâ€”simply that our Lord is still alive and that there
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.880]   he is able to help us.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.920]   Now, I say that that is not the argument of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.120]   That is not the Christian message at all, and I have a very good argument in order to
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.720]   prove that to you without wasting time this morning.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.180]   There was no need for Paul to argue about that.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.320]   The Greeks already believed in the immortality of the soul.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.120]   So if that were the only message of Easter and the resurrection, he's wasting his time.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.280]   He's writing to Greeks in Corinth, and they'd been taught by their philosophers to believe
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.960]   in the immortality of the soul and the persistence of life after death.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.200]   So clearly, and obviously, and patently, that isn't the message.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.760]   Well, what is the message?
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.800]   Well, I say the message is this.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   It is the proclamation of the final conquest of death itself, and of the ultimate final
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:32.320]   redemption even of our bodies, the salvation even of the body, which is going to be glorified
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.280]   and render perfect and entire even as the body of the risen Lord himself.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.880]   That's the argument of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.360]   And that is the argument which in these verses, 54 to 57, the apostle puts in this grand and
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360]   glorious climax.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.480]   Well, now then, my friend, here's the question.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.560]   How does this come to us?
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.160]   What was our response and reaction as we read this chapter at the beginning?
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.600]   How did you feel when I read again to you these particular verses?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:13.320]   Were you merely moved by the extraordinary eloquence of the language, the mighty rhetoric,
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.840]   the marshalling of arguments, the placing of the parallels and the opposites?
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.440]   Were you just moved aesthetically or artistically?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.480]   Were you conscious merely of some wonderful sense of enjoyment and of vague uplift and
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   of pleasure as you listened to the reading of one of the great masterpieces of all literature?
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.040]   Or did you just have some vague, comfortable feeling within and some general sense of cheer?
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.360]   Well, if so, I'm afraid we have missed the real point of the chapter and the real point
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.400]   of these verses.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.200]   How should this message come to us?
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.440]   Well, the apostle tells us, "If this message comes to us truly, this is what it does to
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.560]   us.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.920]   It makes us want to thank God.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.420]   It makes us want to rise up and say, 'Thanks be unto God.'
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.100]   The second thing it makes us do is this.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.120]   It gives us a sense of victory and of triumph.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.800]   'Thanks be unto God,' which giveth us the victory, sense of victory and of triumph and
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.520]   of prevailing.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.440]   And thirdly, it should come to us in such a way as to fill us with a desire to look
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:40.240]   death in the face and to challenge him and to say, 'Oh, death, where is thy sting?'
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.680]   And then to look into an open grave, your open grave and mine, to see it already dug
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.480]   and to look into it and say, 'Oh, grave, where is thy victory?'
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.240]   To challenge it and to defy it.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.800]   Now then, the question I ask, therefore, is this.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.920]   Did it come to us like that?
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.120]   Is that our reaction to this chapter and to these verses at the end?
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:14.040]   I press my question for this good reason, that I am persuaded that this is the real
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.800]   test of our Christian profession.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.680]   This is the kind of thing that really shows what our whole position is and whether our
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.960]   profession of Christianity is simply something formal or traditional or habitual, something
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.800]   which we were brought up in, or whether it has come to us individually as a living power
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   from God.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.200]   I say that our response to this chapter, this final bit of argument, is one that indicates
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:52.560]   so clearly our total position and our real standing this morning face to face with God.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.400]   Now then, let me then put it like this to you.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.360]   What is it that leads to this desire to thank God as we look at this?
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.480]   What is it that makes us have this sense of victory and of triumph?
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.760]   What is it that makes a man feel like challenging death and the grave?
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.040]   Well, there are two main answers to that question, and I want to call your attention to them
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   this morning.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:24.600]   Now, these two things are the two things that are always present when we are considering
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   Christianity.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.320]   There are only two essentials before we become Christian.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.400]   They are absolute essentials, and you can't leave out either of them.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.200]   They must always go together, and without either of them our whole position collapses.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   What are they?
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.520]   Well, let me put them to you in this way.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.160]   Here is the first.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.280]   Any man who, having heard the message of the resurrection, gets up and says, "Thanks
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.440]   be unto God," and who has this sense of triumph and who defies death and the grave,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:08.520]   is a man who has accepted the actual, literal fact of our Lord's resurrection.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   That is the first essential.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.600]   The basis of all this reaction, this feeling, this triumph, this praise, and this joy, is,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   as the Apostle takes the trouble to tell us, the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:34.000]   "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   You see, once more, Christianity isn't a philosophy, it isn't a teaching.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.480]   It's always about this person, and it's always about the things that have happened
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   to this person.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.960]   It is through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the things that have happened to him, through
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.760]   the things that he did when he was here, in this world, in flesh and blood, manned as
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.680]   ourselves this last Adam, this second man.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:05.280]   Now, that is absolutely pivotal and essential to the Christian position.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.080]   If you take away the fact of the resurrection, Paul could never have written this epistle.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.120]   He even tells us that himself.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:19.480]   He says, "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.040]   Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:30.400]   If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.960]   If Christ be not risen, then our preaching is vain, and your faith is vain also."
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.240]   For what he had been preaching to them, he tells them, at the beginning of the chapter
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   is this.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.760]   "I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.280]   our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose again
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.220]   the third day according to the scriptures, and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.740]   twelve, after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.480]   part remain unto this present hour, but some are fallen asleep, after that he was seen
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.080]   of James, then of all the apostles, and last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.640]   out of due time."
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   Seen?
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.680]   The literal fact of the resurrection.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.640]   Not that Christ is still alive, though he died, and that they can still pray to him.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640]   No, no.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:32.360]   That he came out of the grave, that they saw him in this risen body, and had fellowship
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.280]   with him, and that the disciples apart from this man Paul had seen him eating the broiled
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.760]   fish and the honey, and had heard him say, "See, I'm not a ghost, for a ghost doesn't
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.400]   eat like this, and doesn't have flesh and bones as you see me have."
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.540]   Oh, I say that this is the first essential thing, and I can tell you what's the matter
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.080]   with the Christian church today.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.000]   I can tell you why the Christian church doesn't rise up and say, "Thanks be to God."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I can tell you why the Christian church is not like a mighty army marching and traveling
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.320]   victoriously through this world, but is languishing and drooping and shuffling.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:18.000]   I can tell you why she's become uncertain of the fact of the resurrection.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.160]   She says, "It isn't scientific.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.080]   The scientists don't believe it.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.140]   This sort of thing doesn't happen."
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.280]   She begins off peddling it, and now she's almost forgotten it.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.640]   "Ah, it's the persistence of Christ."
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:35.680]   That's the thing they say, and they've missed out the cardinal fact, the literal, physical
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.160]   resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ in the body.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.840]   Or if that isn't true, every single argument the apostle uses here is rubbish.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   It doesn't apply.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   It's nonsense.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.360]   What's the point of that argument about sowing the grain, and it's dying, and it's coming
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.320]   up again with a new body?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.000]   What's all this argument about different flesh of fishes and birds and all the rest of it,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.880]   and the difference between one star and another in glory?
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   It's all idle.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   It's nonsense.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:10.200]   No, no, his whole case, his whole argument.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.800]   Everything he has to give to us by way of comfort and of hope is based solidly and centrally
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:22.560]   upon the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ, who was crucified and died and buried on Good
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:29.680]   Friday, literally, actually came out of the grave in that body which was changed and glorified
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   and appeared unto these chosen witnesses and to various other people.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.920]   It is the fact.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:48.520]   And you never have a triumphant, glorying, praising church except when the church believes
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:57.400]   the fact, the actuality of the rising of the Son of God from the grave, leaving the grave
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:04.320]   clothes behind, and himself coming out and back and appearing for forty days and then
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.360]   ascending in the sight of the apostles into heaven to take his seat at the right hand
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.680]   of God.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.280]   What fools we are.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.760]   What fools are men with their supposed learning and knowledge, flying in the face of facts
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.260]   and imagining that you can hold on to the teaching and jettison the facts at the same
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.260]   time.
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.720]   It can't be done.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.200]   And the very state of the church today proves it.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.520]   Unless you let go of the facts, though you may try to work up yourself and an enthusiasm,
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.560]   you won't have an enthusiasm.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.860]   You'll be whistling in the dark, trying to encourage yourself, indulging in a kind of
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.160]   spiritual courteousness, but you won't be happy yourself and you'll make nobody else
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   happy.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.800]   Oh no, the first thing that is absolutely essential is the fact.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.600]   Now is Christ risen from the dead.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   It's a fact.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.480]   But let me come to the second thing, because it's equally essential.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.920]   The second thing that always is essential before we are truly Christian is that we understand
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.960]   the fact.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.840]   Fact plus explanation or understanding.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:25.600]   And you know this understanding is also essential, for unless we really understand what it means,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.680]   the fact will be something vague and nebulous and indefinite to us.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.800]   The apostle therefore takes the trouble to work it out and to expound it and to explain
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   it to us.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.920]   Let's follow him.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.720]   What is the understanding that we must have?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:45.200]   Here again I divide it into two portions.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.280]   The first thing that we must understand if we are to know the thrill of the fact of the
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:58.040]   resurrection is our own condition by nature as the result of sin and as the result of
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   the fall.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.600]   That's the first thing.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:10.720]   The only people who really know what it is to be happy are those who have been unhappy.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.960]   You remember our Lord in the house of that Pharisee Simon, and Simon was amazed at that
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.600]   woman who dropped at his feet and washed his feet with their tears and wiped them with
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.440]   the hair of her head and was lavishing her love upon him.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   Simon hadn't done that.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.600]   And our Lord says, "No, no, it's to those to whom much has been forgiven, they're the
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.000]   ones who love much."
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.880]   You'll never really know the glory of the resurrection until you see the depth out of
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.480]   which it raises you.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.840]   So we start there.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:49.280]   It is essential that we should realize what we are and where, by nature, as the result
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.200]   of sin.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.000]   You see, the resurrection comes in as a contrast.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.560]   That's why he bursts forth and says, "But thanks be to God."
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.400]   This wonderful contrast.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.880]   Well, what is this condition?
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:10.640]   There's only one way of understanding it, and it's the way that the apostle himself
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.640]   takes.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.040]   Let's go back to Adam.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:21.600]   "For since by men came death, by men came also the resurrection of the dead.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.280]   For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.300]   If you don't get that contrast, you'll know nothing about the feeling of thanks be unto
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.440]   God and the victory and the challenge to death and the grave.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.920]   You've got to go back, I say, and realize what happened.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   Well, what is it?
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.200]   There it is.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.880]   And you see again how important the facts are.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:57.720]   Adam was made perfect, the first man, the first Adam, the head of the race, man's federal
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.000]   head and representative.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.840]   God made him perfect and looked upon him and placed him there in paradise.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   And had he lived according to God's law, God gave him a commandment, you remember.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.680]   He would have continued there.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.520]   He would have undergone, no doubt, some process of glorification, but he would never have
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.200]   died.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.160]   But God said to him, "Look here, Adam.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.000]   You can eat all the fruit of the trees of this garden, but that one tree, the tree of
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.360]   the knowledge of good and evil, if you eat of that, eating of it, you shall die."
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   God warned him.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   He told him.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.360]   He laid down the law.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   There was the condition.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.520]   If he kept it, all was well.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.520]   If he didn't, he would be punished.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.680]   He would be visited with dire punishment, and that would include physical death and
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:49.040]   spiritual death, separation out of the sight of God and out of the life of God.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:58.480]   And Adam sinned, and Adam fell, and what God had threatened came to pass.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:07.440]   Adam, by sinning and falling and disobeying God, became a slave under the dominion of
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:14.760]   Satan, under the dominion of sin, under the dominion of death, under the dominion of the
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.960]   law.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:24.360]   From the moment he sinned, that is the condition of Adam, defeated and a slave and in bondage,
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.720]   with these powers tyrannizing over him.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   Look at them again.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:37.920]   The devil and sin and the law of God condemning him and the wrath of God and death itself.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:45.200]   Now, the apostle puts all this in a great statement in Romans 5.12, "For since by men
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:55.000]   sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so sin passed upon all men, death reigned,"
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.480]   he says again in that chapter, "from Adam to Moses.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.200]   It has reigned ever since."
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.920]   Now, that is the condition of mankind.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.400]   This not only happened to Adam.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.880]   It has happened to all the children of Adam, all the progeny of Adam, all the seed of Adam,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.680]   all who come out of Adam, it has happened to us.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:21.840]   Here it is again, you see, "For since by men came death," that one man and that one sin
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:30.960]   has brought death upon us all, and we are all born slaves, born in sin, shaped in iniquity.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:37.440]   And we are all born under the tyranny of these terrible powers that are set against us.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.320]   The devil is the strongman armed that keepeth his goods at peace.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.480]   We are all by nature under the dominion of the devil in his kingdom.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.960]   We are under the dominion of sin.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   It defeats us.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.000]   It attacks us.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.900]   We fall to its temptations and enticements that sin tyrannizes over us.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.920]   And there is the law of God set against us, condemning us, the Ten Commandments and its
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.920]   demands.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   We can't keep them.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.920]   It's a tyranny.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   It's against us.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:13.680]   And at the back of it all there is death itself.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.360]   Death reigned.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.520]   Death came upon all men, and there it is.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.000]   And as you remember, the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it so perfectly in his
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.520]   great letter in the second chapter when he puts it like this, in verses 14 and following,
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:36.480]   "For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.520]   took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:48.800]   death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.480]   subject to bondage."
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.160]   I mustn't keep you this morning, but you know that's the whole story of the human
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.360]   race.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.960]   Ever since Adam fell, the whole human race has been subject to this bondage of the fear
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   of death.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.560]   It's an awful specter.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.920]   We try to forget it.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.320]   We try to make ourselves young and to keep young.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.800]   We try to not think of death.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.160]   We call it morbid, but there it is, and we can't get away from it.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.560]   And we try to keep ourselves young.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.840]   We do everything, but it's there, a sense of doom, a sense of fear, and a sense of guilt.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   I needn't keep you.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.920]   Let me put it to you.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.520]   In the words of Shakespeare, Hamlet knew all about it.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.800]   You see, that was his problem.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:33.120]   Here he was surrounded by problems and difficulties, and he says in his mighty soliloquy, "Well,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.560]   why don't I take the obvious way out?
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.500]   Why not commit suicide?
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.600]   It could be done so quickly.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.000]   Why do I go on enduring all this?"
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Listen to him.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.480]   "For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.960]   man's contumely, the pangs of disprised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:59.040]   and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his coitus make
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.080]   with a bare botkin?
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:09.720]   Who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:17.520]   something after death, the undiscovered country from whose born no traveller returns, puzzles
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:24.400]   the will, and makes us rather bears the ills we have than fly to others that we know not
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   of?
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:31.600]   Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.480]   That's why we put up with it all.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.200]   Though life may be a living hell, we don't go out by that back door.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.760]   We're afraid of suicide.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:44.360]   Why, well, oh, it's this undiscovered country, the dread of something after death, the undiscovered
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:55.920]   country from whose born no traveller returns, puzzles the will, and makes us rather bear
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.840]   the ills we have than fly to others that we know not of?
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.840]   Conscience speaks.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.360]   Oh, that's just another way of saying that death reigns over all men, death passed upon
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   all men.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:14.480]   We've got it, a sense of fear, a sense of foreboding, a sense of guilt, a sense of doom.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.080]   Yet, do what we will, it's there, it remains, it persists.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.600]   There's an enemy, the last enemy, and it's death.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:30.540]   Death and the grave are tyrannizing the whole of life.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.400]   That's our position by nature.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.760]   That is the condition of everybody born into this world.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.040]   That's what we are as the result of Adam's sin and our own sin.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.320]   Very well, then, I say, if you don't realize that, you'll never realize the truth of the
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.640]   resurrection and its glory.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   What is that?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.640]   Well, now, let me come to it.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   Here's the second part.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.840]   As we have to realize what we were by nature and as the result of the fall, so we have
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:04.080]   to realize what the Lord Jesus Christ has done and has accomplished on our behalf.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   What is it?
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.320]   Well, listen, the apostle tells us.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.880]   He says you and I are in a position to be able to say that death is swallowed up in
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:19.720]   victory and we're able to say, "O death, where is thy sting, and O grave, where is thy victory?"
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.920]   How are you able to say that?
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.280]   What is it that enables a man to say that?
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.680]   What have I got to know in order to be able to say that?
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.320]   Do you know the answer?
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.440]   It's a pure bit of theology, but I'm not interested in theology.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.840]   I'm a practical man of affairs.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.400]   I believe in practical Christian . . . you can be a practical man if you like, but you'll
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:43.200]   never know the glory of the resurrection unless you know something about theology, about doctrine,
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   about an explanation.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:53.960]   Listen, the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:01.920]   What's all this, says someone, well, listen, the sting of death is sin.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.080]   He means the power of death is sin.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.280]   The thing that makes death death, the thing about death that hurts us and damages us and
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.240]   destroys us is sin.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   The power of death is sin.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.560]   Why well sin is the cause of death, as I've explained to you.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.760]   It was by the one man's transgression that sin came in.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.000]   By man, sin entered into the world.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.260]   That's the power of death, you see.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.720]   It was because he sinned that God punished him by death.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.400]   So the sting of death is sin.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.280]   And also, as I tried to show you, the thing that gives death its terror is this selfsame
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.120]   thing, sin.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.880]   Death would not be terrifying were it not for sin and for what we know that sin involves
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.360]   and the sense of guilt.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.820]   So the sting of it is sin.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:59.520]   But then he says, then, the strength of sin is the law, you see, the steps.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.760]   He means this.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:11.520]   What makes sin the thing that leads to death is the law, that original law that God gave
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.680]   to Adam when he told him not to eat of the fruit of that tree.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.060]   That's the law, a commandment, so that any breaking of that becomes a transgression.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.160]   And the law, therefore, not only says that it is sin and transgression, but it furthermore
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.760]   pronounces the sentence, "Where there is no law, sin is not imputed," says Paul to
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.840]   the Romans.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.320]   Sin isn't reckoned apart from law, but when law comes in, it pinpoints it, it defines
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.840]   it, and it brings in the appropriate punishment.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.120]   Now then, what has the Lord Jesus Christ done for us?
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.360]   How has he delivered us?
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.000]   And this is the answer.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.560]   The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into this world in order to deliver us from
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:02.080]   every single consequence of the fall, every one of them.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.800]   And if we don't realize that, I say, we haven't a gospel.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:11.060]   He came from heaven, he took unto him the nature of men, Abraham's seed, he was born
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:15.560]   of the virgin, he lived, he gave a perfect obedience to the law, he went passively and
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.320]   died upon the cross bearing our sins, he was buried, he rose again, he ascended, he is
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.960]   seated at the right hand of God.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   What's it all for?
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.640]   I say it is to deliver us from every one of these tyrants that tyrannizes over us by nature,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.160]   every one.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.440]   So look at him.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:42.600]   See him conquering the devil, not only in the wilderness, but elsewhere.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.000]   See him conquering sin and temptation, he never sinned, no one could point a finger
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.140]   at him.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:56.240]   See him honoring God's law perfectly, obeying it in its every detail, every jot and tittle
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:02.840]   of its demands, he fulfilled them all, he left nothing undone.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.200]   But still there is one thing left, you see.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.200]   The law pronounces judgment upon us, it condemns us.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:16.040]   Very well he went to the cross, and he took upon him our sins and our guilt, and he bore
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:25.920]   the punishment, but oh, you say he did, but it cost him his death.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.040]   And there they take his body down, and they put it in that grave of that wealthy man Joseph
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:36.680]   of Arimathea, in that garden, and they put a stone over it, there's the end, it's
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   finished.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.040]   Of all the enemies but one, death has conquered him.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:48.840]   Yes, it's quite true to say the last enemy that shall be conquered is death.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.360]   He died, he was buried, he was laid in a grave.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:58.640]   Yes, but thanks be unto God who giveth us the victory, he's risen, he's burst asunder
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:04.160]   the bands of death, he's triumphed over death, the last enemy has been destroyed,
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:11.440]   he's risen, he's triumphed over every one of them.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.200]   But this is the thing that you and I have to grasp, that he did that not only for himself,
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.600]   but for us.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.240]   He had no need to do it.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.260]   He came to be our representative, the second man, the last Adam.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:32.120]   As Adam began a race, here is one beginning a new race, for us, his people, those who
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:37.080]   belong to him, those that are united to him, he's done it all for us.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:45.560]   So you see, what we see in his death and resurrection is this, he has taken the sting out of death.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.960]   It can no longer harm us who believe in him.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   How?
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.200]   Well, like this, the sting of death is sin, but the strength of sin is the law, and he
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.480]   has dealt with the law.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.360]   So he's dealt with the power that was in the sting, and therefore it's harmless.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.440]   It's like pulling a sting out.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.200]   He has given this perfect satisfaction to the law, and the law's got nothing to say
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.480]   to us any more if we are in Christ and if we believe in him.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.720]   In other words, he has done this work on our behalf, and we are in him, quickened together
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.240]   with him, raised together with him, seated in the heavenly places together with him.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.840]   And therefore, says Paul, if you realize that and realize you're in him, and realize what
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:34.080]   he's done to satisfy all the enemies and all the demands, you realize that you have a perfect
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:42.520]   salvation, even including eventually your very body.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.560]   That's the argument of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.880]   Already we know that we are justified.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.200]   The rising of Christ is for our justification.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.360]   What's happening in the resurrection is that God is telling us, "I'm satisfied with his
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   work.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.160]   I put your sins upon him.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.720]   He's borne the punishment.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   He's conquered.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:07.800]   I'm telling you I'm satisfied, delivered for our offenses, raised again for our justification.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   Look at him," says God, "and hear my pronouncement.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.120]   I am pronouncing that I regard you as just in him, that he's paid the penalty.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:25.360]   He has fulfilled the law for you, raised for your justification, so that I can say that
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.520]   I am dead indeed unto sin.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.120]   I am dead unto the law.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.280]   Satan no longer has dominion over me.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.240]   The whole world lieth in the evil one," says John.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:41.520]   But he says at the same time, "that evil one toucheth us not, because we belong to God."
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   So we've got the victory.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.160]   "Ah, wait a moment," says someone, "you've still got to die, haven't you?"
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   Perfectly true.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.600]   But you know, death has already been changed for the Christian.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.280]   The sting has been taken out.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.120]   Death now for the Christian is simply what the apostle calls sleep.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:06.840]   "They that sleep," he says, "death is no longer the terror that it was to the Christian.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.920]   It's no longer that awful specter that is there.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.000]   The Christian falls on sleep.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   They that sleep."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.960]   No, no, there no longer is death any terror.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.800]   The sting has been taken out as the result of Christ fulfilling the law.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.680]   We simply fall on sleep.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.600]   Death has really been destroyed for us.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   Christ has done it.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:36.840]   We see it in him and we look forward to the certainty of the same thing happening to us.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.480]   As he was raised, we shall be raised, says the apostle.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.080]   We shall likewise be raised.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   Why?
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.200]   Well, because he has conquered even the last enemy and we look forward with triumph to
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.960]   our resurrection when we likewise shall have triumphed.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.840]   But the point is we know it now.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.640]   Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire, so John in his vision.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.000]   And he says there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither there shall
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.520]   be any pain, for the former things are passed away.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   Very well.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   There is the explanation.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:21.440]   As I close, therefore, I want to ask my question again.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.680]   Have you got this victory over death?
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.280]   Are you bursting to say, "Thanks be unto God who giveth us the victory?"
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.640]   Are you full of praise, marvel, wonder?
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.080]   Can you look at death and the grave and defy them?
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   Can you?
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:46.680]   Can you be able to listen, "Thanks be unto God which giveth us here and now"?
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   It's not future.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.640]   He doesn't say, "Thanks be unto God who is going to give us the victory."
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:58.720]   "Thanks be unto God that giveth us the victory here and now."
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.200]   By which he means that you and I should see these things and so understand them and be
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:09.480]   so certain of them that we've already got the victory and the feeling of victory within.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.440]   We can look at death and the grave and challenge them and defy them.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   We can smile in the face of death if we understand this, "Thanks be unto God that giveth us"â€”we've
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.080]   already got it, the victory.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.780]   I want to go even one step further.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:40.360]   The Christian is not only a man who should have lost the fear of death and the grave.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.720]   He should not just have a victory in that sense.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:51.560]   The apostle takes us even one step beyond that in writing to the Philippians.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:59.240]   The man who truly is in Christ and who knows his Lord and who understands these things
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:06.040]   is not only and not merely a man who no longer fears death and the grave.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.360]   He knows something about even looking forward to them.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:24.120]   Death even becomes a friend, "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:32.240]   I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.800]   far better.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:43.400]   Now, he was only able to say that because he knew that the Lord Jesus Christ had conquered
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.160]   the last enemy, every one of them, death included.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.040]   That's the message of the resurrection.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.160]   "Your salvation and mine is going to be a complete and a perfect salvation."
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:04.120]   It isn't merely a spiritual deliverance because when men fell, men fell spirit, soul, and
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   body.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.960]   "You know this old body that you and I have?
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.680]   It's the body of our humiliation," says Paul in Philippians 3.21.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   It's a frail body.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.120]   It's a weak body subject to diseases and infirmities.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.320]   It's a frail body and it hasn't yet been redeemed.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:27.920]   "But you know," says Paul to the Romans in chapter 8, verse 23, "even we ourselves that
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:34.360]   have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:40.840]   the adoption," what is that, "to wit, the redemption of our bodies."
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:48.000]   And there in Philippians 3.21 he says, "The Lord Jesus Christ, whom we await from heaven,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.120]   why do we await him?"
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:55.360]   Well, he says, "For this reason, who shall change this, our vile body, the body of our
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:01.000]   humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to that
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.480]   mighty working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself."
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:14.080]   Oh, let's not rob ourselves of this bit, let's not detract from the perfection and the glory
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   of salvation.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.360]   "The body is to be raised.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:27.480]   We shall spend our eternity not as disembodied spirits, but in glorified bodies."
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.920]   "How," you say, "well," says the apostle, "it's a mystery.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.360]   Tell me, explain to me what happens to that grain that you put in the ground, and then
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.840]   I'll explain this to you.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:44.400]   All I know is this, that my body, this form that is mine, will be my form to all eternity,
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:50.160]   a spiritual body, to clothe my immortal spirit.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:55.760]   I shall be perfectly redeemed, spirit, soul, and body.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.880]   We shall be raised."
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:08.800]   The message of the resurrection is the message of the final redemption of the whole man,
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.120]   the body included.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:18.800]   "Thanks be unto God, which giveth us the victory."
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.200]   "Oh, death, where is thy sting?
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.440]   Oh, grave, where is thy victory?"
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:35.840]   Death is swallowed up in life, you see it in Christ.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:44.640]   It will happen to us, and finally, death and Hades shall be cast into the lake of fire
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.960]   and destroyed forever.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:41:09.840]   "Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ, amen."
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
