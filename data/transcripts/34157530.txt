[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.620]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.320]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.460]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.080]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.840]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.400]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.320]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.880]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.220]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.520]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.880]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.400]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.160]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.840]   Well, listeners, welcome to this episode of "Everyday Educator."
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.480]   We are hurtling into the holiday season.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.800]   I know that you are probably feeling
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.320]   the pace of life speed up for you.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560]   The holidays are almost upon us.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.440]   Next week is Thanksgiving.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.520]   Well, you'll be hearing this,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.880]   and it will be Thanksgiving week.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.080]   And I don't know about you.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.480]   I know for me, once mid-November arrives,
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.000]   it feels like I am just in the headlong plunge
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.040]   toward Christmas.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   And as a homeschool mom,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.760]   I love, love, love spending days with my girls.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.480]   I loved it when they were little,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.680]   and when they were older,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.760]   I loved building those holiday memories,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.320]   even while we still had chores to do
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.640]   and schoolwork to finish,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.380]   and with the holidays, guests to welcome.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.400]   I suspect that you're in the same boat.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.520]   So what is a family to do?
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.800]   How can we?
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.000]   And you know what?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.040]   I think these thoughts every year.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.320]   One year, I'm gonna conquer it, I believe.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.440]   I fully believe.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   How can we simplify life in a busy time,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.040]   celebrating with everyone while we do life together?
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.000]   So today, my dear friend Amy Jones is with me,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.240]   and we're gonna talk through this idea
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.960]   of how can we make the holidays
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.600]   all that we desire it to be
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.800]   while we're still getting stuff done
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.840]   and we are making our guests feel welcome
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.960]   and a part of our family?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.080]   Amy, thank you so much for helping me think about this.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.880]   - Oh man, this is gonna be so much fun, Lisa.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.520]   It just has brought back so many good
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.840]   and interesting memories.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.960]   - Yes, I know, I was gonna say,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.120]   it has brought back, as I've pondered it,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.600]   it has brought about good memories
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   and memories that I think,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.920]   yeah, that was a dark day in the Bailey household.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.840]   But you know what?
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.600]   God lets us redeem our mistakes.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.680]   And so hopefully, listeners,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.040]   you will learn from mistakes
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.640]   that Amy and I have made down the road.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920]   Let me ask you, Amy,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   what were the holidays like with little kids at home?
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.960]   - Oh, well, it was, you know, pretty chaotic.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   As most of it, honestly,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.200]   it was just another little bit of more chaos
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   than home schooling.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.120]   (laughing)
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.200]   I never felt like my days were just super smooth
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.560]   and peaceful anyway,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.000]   but the holidays just added another layer
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.920]   of what I, when I was really wrestling with the holidays,
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.240]   is more stuff to do, you know?
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.080]   - Uh-huh.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.520]   - Instead of, I think I learned pretty early
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   that I had to make up a space
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   that where the holidays
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.160]   or a place that might,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.440]   we, holidays, holy days,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.240]   days that we could actually celebrate
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.120]   instead of being run here hither and yon.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.440]   And so it was busy,
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.480]   but there's always excitement, you know?
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.680]   The children had so much excitement.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.000]   And just, I was thinking,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.680]   especially when you have a five or six-year-old,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.320]   you know, they've only gone through Christmas,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.000]   maybe remembering it two or three times.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.680]   It's not a tradition for them.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.880]   - Right, right.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.760]   - Everything is like this wonder,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.680]   like, "Oh, we're gonna put up,"
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200]   just simple things, you know,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.600]   just decorations in the store or lights
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.920]   or that sort of thing.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.280]   Just being reminded that this is really new for them.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.840]   And just celebrating that newness with them.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.440]   And then, you know, as the kids got older,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.680]   they kind of took on their own,
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   like they had their own Christmas events
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.520]   or expectations with friends and that sort of thing.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   So, you know, you kind of morph your Christmas
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.040]   with your family.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.840]   You grow with your family.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.920]   Yes, definitely excitement,
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.480]   definitely busyness,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   and a lot of fun, a lot of expectations that we had.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   - Yes, that's really true.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.360]   And sometimes my expectations,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.400]   'cause you made a really excellent point
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.760]   that oddly I've never really thought about.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.520]   I have to say that when our kids are really young,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.120]   tradition is not really a thing for them, okay?
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.720]   Because if they are only four or five years old,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.840]   they only remember probably two Christmases,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.200]   maybe three if they had words really early.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.720]   And so tradition,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   we get hung up on doing the traditional things for our kids,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.400]   but really we are the only ones that remember
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.000]   that this is a tradition.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.040]   And so I really like that,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.240]   that we should take a cue from our kids
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   and just find the wonder in the simple things that we do.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   I know that my daughter who is grown and married
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.040]   and she has two little children of her own,
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.800]   she decided that this year
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.880]   she was putting her tree up early.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   It's like, it's so like,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.960]   I never do it before Thanksgiving.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.720]   And she's like, "Mom, then just don't come here."
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.920]   And so she put it up and she sent me the sweetest video
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.600]   because my grandson is almost two and a half
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.480]   and they put up the tree and he came in and he saw it
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.560]   and he was so excited
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.160]   because he remembers it a little bit from last year.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.520]   He ran over and he found his nutcracker ornament.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   And then Sarah said she turned around
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.440]   and the next thing she knew he was grabbing,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.200]   Grace is about seven and a half months old.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.000]   He was dragging her little bouncy chair
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.640]   over to the tree and turning it.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.080]   And he was saying, "Look, Grace, look,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   it's the Christmas tree."
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.920]   And so he was sharing the wonder of,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.040]   and it had nothing on it but lights
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.840]   and his one little ornament.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.800]   So I think it's a really good reminder
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   that beautiful things are simple things to our kids.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.840]   Let me ask you this.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.840]   'Cause I know, I mean, it's crazy now.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.920]   I went in the store the other day
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.080]   and like the day after Halloween,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.880]   all the Christmas candy was out.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.040]   It's crazy.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.280]   So, I mean, there's all kinds of holiday cues around
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.720]   that make our kids think,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.000]   "Woohoo, it's holiday playtime now."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.280]   But we're all still trying to finish out our fall semester.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.600]   We're trying to finish strong and finish well.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.520]   Did you keep doing schoolwork over the holidays?
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.080]   Like between Thanksgiving and Christmas, did you do school?
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.000]   - I think this was really helpful for me
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.880]   because at first I was just reaction like,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.680]   "Oh, we're gonna do school until,"
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.760]   I was very mindset, "Until the 15th."
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.600]   And then-
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.440]   - Yes.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.400]   - And I realized that that was not really healthy
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.800]   for our family that my husband teaches.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.520]   So that's like a heavy grading period.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.280]   So he's distracted and he's tired.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.280]   And holidays, you take on another set of tasks
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.400]   that you enjoy doing as a mom of,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.760]   or I don't know about you, our traditional homes,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   you're probably the one that sort of plans out
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.680]   the month of December.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.240]   And I just realized that was,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.160]   that was, and a wiser person has told me
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.160]   that is a significant part of nurturing your home.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.840]   So please allow time for that.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.160]   So the best thing I did was to actually say,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.240]   "This is when we stop."
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.960]   And not do this wiggly kind of like,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.680]   "Oh, we'll do a math lesson here
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.560]   and we'll do a, you know, read that book."
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.000]   And so, nope, we're finished with school.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.200]   Usually at the end of November, we took a few weeks.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.840]   Now, as they went through high school
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.480]   and they handled their,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.600]   they had an idea of what they wanted to do, of course,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.960]   and their school does go.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.000]   But for, I just shifted and said,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "Okay, for several years, we made our quote school,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.960]   like what are Christmas traditions?"
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.880]   One year we did other countries as we'd been in CC.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.400]   So, you know, what did they do in Switzerland
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.440]   and what do they do?
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.720]   And, you know, get their shoes out and, you know,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.760]   eat different foods.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.680]   You know, we, I kind of saw that as an opportunity
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.440]   to really understand,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.080]   to incorporate just the beauty of the world,
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.440]   you know, realize opportunities to be outside,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.360]   to visit people, to minister to people.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.120]   There were opportunities within our church
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.360]   of going to visit a nursing home.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.000]   We did a few years, we did just ringing
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.480]   those simple little bells and singing.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.480]   And those things do require time.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.960]   And that means something else needs to be put aside.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.240]   And that doesn't mean I'm a failure.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.840]   It just means, but somehow having it in my mind
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.560]   that that is my intent of doing it.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.280]   I've done it badly where I've just like, you know,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.520]   kicking against the goads, we're gonna do school.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.800]   - Right, right.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.680]   - No one's happy.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.520]   I'm not happy.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.880]   I feel like I've failed because I didn't,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.560]   I thought, oh dear, you know,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.920]   we're gonna have to go to this service project now.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.760]   It's gonna take off.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.600]   - Right, yes.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.320]   - It's kind of ridiculous.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.640]   So I just realized this is a gift to our family
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.000]   and not be driven by the curriculum,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.080]   but actually say, nope, this is our holiday
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.000]   and this is how we're gonna shift focus
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   and spend time with the Lord.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.520]   And like even the Christmas story,
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   not giving things short shrift
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.360]   because I'm too preoccupied with what I think,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.120]   quote, I think should be my agenda.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.600]   So yes, we took a significant time off at Christmas
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.200]   and I would encourage people to take time off
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   after Christmas and help people kind of onboard
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.280]   into the school year.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.600]   They, usually they're overtired and they need rest.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.720]   - Yes, oh, that's so true.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.640]   You have said so many good things, Amy.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.760]   I wanna highlight them
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.400]   'cause I don't want us to just gloss over.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.200]   One of the best things that you just said was,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.040]   you know, we can be intentional about taking a break.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:10.920]   I think that so often we are not satisfied
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.000]   because we haven't fully embraced one or the other.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.680]   Either do school, you know, do your assignments,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.240]   continue with your math lesson
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.680]   or continue with your geography practice
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.080]   or continue with your memorization facts
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   or stop and do something totally different.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.600]   Do Christmas traditions around the world.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.520]   You know, bake a nativity out of clay or gingerbread.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.560]   Embrace something completely different.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.560]   And 'cause you're right.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   When we sort of do school and we sort of take a break,
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.400]   we fully don't enjoy it.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.240]   - Right, that's exactly right.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.520]   - That's been my experience.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.240]   I don't enjoy the break and I don't feel good
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.960]   about the quote, unquote, work that we do.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.440]   So it is really okay to take a break.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.120]   The times that people are the most disappointed
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.120]   I have discovered are when their expectations aren't met.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.320]   And so if we expect that we're gonna get just as much done
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.120]   as we always do in that run up to the holidays,
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.960]   then we're doomed because all kinds of things come up,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.080]   all kinds of invitations, all kinds of special services
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.480]   or special projects or visitors or invitations come
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   and we just are left feeling like we're a failure.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.760]   - Yeah, and we really do miss opportunities.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.600]   - Yes.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.880]   - We don't, the lack of flexibility, you know,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   we've been, when we become so rigid about what must happen,
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.480]   you know, when there is some serendipitous event
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.760]   or like even with Gideon spinning,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   like everyone just enjoying the tree, you know,
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.240]   it's not just about, okay, it's up, click, check, done.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.320]   - Yeah, yes, exactly.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.560]   - Let's sit and have some hot cocoa today.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.760]   And unless, and just, and I think asking,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.720]   especially when the kids get a little older,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.760]   like 10 or 11, just being very conscious
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.360]   that they have their own expectations for Christmas.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.760]   It's not just gifts.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.800]   It could be maybe some expectations
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.720]   of just being with other people or being quiet.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.760]   I have a quiet one who likes,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.560]   he doesn't like a lot of activity.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.200]   I had another one who is super social
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.840]   and wanted people in all the time.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.240]   And just being very mindful.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.600]   This is not, I think the one thing I learned
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.280]   that this is not my Christmas.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.400]   It's just like when I learned, this is not my house.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.240]   - Yes.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.840]   - This is our Christmas.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   This is our home and to be very open with the Lord
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:14.640]   and recognizing he has in mind, he shepherds us.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.720]   He has in mind a Christmas he would like to offer us.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.880]   He has in mind people he would like for us to be with.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.720]   He has times of prayer, maybe a meaningful conversation,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.800]   maybe some fun activity that's funny
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.080]   and brings us together or makes a memory.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.600]   He has that eternal perspective that I don't have.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.960]   So I think just at times just opening my hands
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.440]   and saying when things, especially that usually happens
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.280]   when things don't go my way.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.720]   - Yes, yes.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.560]   - Open my hands and say, how can I receive from you
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.360]   what you have for us this Christmas?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.520]   Because it is such a meaningful time
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   and I just tend to be a cluttered person
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.720]   to clutter our life with activity
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.680]   and what I think is better
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.560]   instead of just being open to the Lord
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.360]   and really trusting him with Christmas.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.400]   Christmas comes with pressures, financial pressures.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.200]   It comes with pressures with maybe it highlights,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.920]   unfortunately in my family at times it did,
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.920]   family disagreements or stresses within families,
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.800]   especially extended families.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.240]   It's not the Hallmark Christmas movie.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.800]   Sometimes people are depressed.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.920]   They struggle with anxiety at Christmas.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.600]   They get lonely at Christmas.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   So to be mindful as a person in the home, as a mom,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.920]   to be mindful that we have the privilege
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   of just being conscious, a person conscious of that
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.840]   and bringing that to prayer.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.600]   Instead of being afraid or anxious or irritated
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.840]   or short tempered to really say,
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.520]   Lord, you have crafted our family.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.960]   You've crafted this event.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.720]   Would you please help us during the season to follow you
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   and be very conscious of watching for how he brings delight.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's always more than we expect.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.840]   - Yes, yes.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.720]   - So we can trust him.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.320]   So I think when I settled that.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.760]   - Right, well, because that's the,
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.320]   when we fill our minds with all these expectations
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.920]   of what we're gonna do and how it's gonna look
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.160]   and how it's gonna turn out
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.520]   and how people are going to love it.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.880]   And then it turns out that they don't love it
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   or it didn't work out that way.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.440]   Or we never got around to fill in the blank.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.520]   Then we're disappointed.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.520]   And as moms, a lot of times we're the thermostat.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.160]   And so when we're disappointed or anxious
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.160]   or even angry about how something worked or didn't work,
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.120]   then that gets passed on to the people in our house.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.280]   And that leads me to something
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.480]   I really wanted to ask you about.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   The holidays, it's usually not just our family
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.240]   that we have around.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.000]   The holidays are sometimes compounded by the fact
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.200]   that we're adding people to our home.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.760]   We have guests, we have visitors that are coming in.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.400]   And sometimes it's grandma and grandpa
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.960]   and we're so excited to see them.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.080]   Or it's people that we see fairly often,
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.760]   but this is a special circumstance.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.660]   But sometimes the guests are people we don't know well.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.000]   Or especially think about it for your children.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.600]   Maybe they've only seen great-aunt Martha
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.620]   twice in their four years and they only remember it once
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.920]   and it wasn't that much fun the first time.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   Or for a lot of our families, they are blended families.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.960]   And so maybe you're seeing step-siblings
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   or step-grandparents or half-sisters or brothers
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.920]   that you don't know well.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.240]   How can we manage that?
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   How do you draw guests into your family rhythms?
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.880]   Even if you've come to grips with your holiday expectations
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.520]   and your family is just happy to find the serendipity moment
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.820]   and everybody's good.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:05.360]   And you have made a commitment not to overschedule
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.040]   and overdo and plan too much.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   And you're just gonna keep it simple.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.840]   How do you draw your guests into that?
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.080]   - I think, first of all, to know that Christ
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.920]   says we are light and we are salt.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.920]   So that doesn't disappear when Christmas comes.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:36.640]   And two, I think, like you said, as a mom,
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.660]   you're setting a tone.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.660]   And so we practice our disciplines of thankfulness
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.740]   instead of complaining.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.900]   That we practice faith and trust
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.220]   instead of being anxious and worried.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.080]   So-and-so always complains about the whatever.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.060]   We have to take care of, this is difficult.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.180]   This takes up time.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.200]   They're just things that we have to plan for.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   So I think for us to just incorporate them
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.100]   just like you would.
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.380]   I keep thinking of the Israelites
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.820]   when they would celebrate Passover.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.100]   And if there was an alien, I think it says,
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.380]   calls a refugee or a servant in your home,
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.060]   that they were invited to the table.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.580]   They were invited into the tradition.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.540]   They were invited into the story of Christ.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:41.300]   And so I think for us, not to say,
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.220]   well, even if you have an unbelieving family members,
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.020]   that just to be really natural and invite them
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.360]   into all the pieces and parts of tradition,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.460]   allowing them to be there.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.940]   Or not if they feel uncomfortable,
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.380]   'cause of course you don't wanna beat people over the head.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:05.340]   But I feel like we tried to, we prayed at meals.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.520]   We just prayed.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.980]   We read the Christmas story.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.020]   We read the night before Christmas.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.460]   We ate candy and just being inviting.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.740]   You are welcome at our table.
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.580]   And you are, and we wanna hear also listening
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.380]   to tell us a story about a Christmas you enjoyed
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.140]   or what are traditions.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.500]   If there's something, well, they enjoy,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.500]   like they always like in the South,
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.380]   it's a wet dressing or dry dressing.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.700]   Well, if they're a wet dressing person,
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.500]   make a pan of wet dressing.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.500]   Just make efforts to bridge maybe or mend fences.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.540]   If there needs to be some fences mended,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.620]   but also just welcoming people to the table.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.620]   And if you recognize there's someone
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.800]   that is kind of feeling a little down
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.220]   or as people do or a little left out,
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.140]   invite them to be drawn in,
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.700]   but also give them the space to just be there.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.700]   And I think that just prayer always.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.100]   And I think one of the things that was a struggle for me
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.100]   is I was just preoccupied and that's when I missed.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.820]   I mean, I could think back,
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.380]   I can remember conversations I missed
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.620]   that they were giving me all sorts of hints,
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:39.580]   and I was too busy, making a sugar cookie or something.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.420]   - Yes, yes.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.580]   - And I didn't stop and look at them.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.380]   And that happens with your kids.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.700]   I think what I noticed, especially with my sons,
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.580]   they're not gonna demand my attention.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.420]   They're going to-
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.980]   - They do, if they have to work too hard for it,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.860]   they might give up.
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.020]   - It's not, well, I don't.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:23:59.840]   And you know, so-
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.680]   - You don't.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.100]   - I don't, and so I don't expect them to come after me.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.100]   And so I think just settling like, okay, who's in my home?
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.860]   What's, I'm not, I love what we were reading in our book.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.660]   I'm not responsible for this person's happiness.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.220]   I'm responsible to this person to be gracious.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.380]   And that's very, those are very different things.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.340]   And that relieves us a lot.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.460]   I'm not responsible for your happiness
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.820]   'cause some people just aren't gonna feel happy
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.940]   or encouraged.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.780]   - Right, right.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.860]   Well, you can't make other people happy.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.700]   - No, no, you can't.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.540]   - You can provide an atmosphere or an opportunity
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.700]   that will lead them to find joy if they will.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.540]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.500]   - Yeah, that's really good.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.540]   That's really good.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.380]   I think that we end up having lots of people
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.220]   like at our house, this Thanksgiving,
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.460]   our list just keeps growing, okay?
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.620]   So it was the year we weren't,
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.940]   our girls were supposed to be with their in-laws.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.740]   But one of my daughters is gonna be here,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.180]   but it turns out that now her in-laws
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.220]   are actually coming to be in our house too.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.980]   And one of her brother-in-laws and his child are coming.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.460]   And then a nephew is bringing his fiance,
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.540]   but also her mother.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.940]   And then we're having my daughter,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.020]   my daughter whose family will not be with us
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.340]   for Thanksgiving.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.460]   Her sister-in-law and little children will be with us.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.380]   And so we have, somebody said to me just the other day,
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.740]   well, that's kind of a motley crowd there, isn't it?
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.900]   And I said, you know what?
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.300]   It's gonna be a lot of fun though,
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.060]   because some of these people
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.340]   are from different parts of the country.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.780]   And so I'm very excited to find out,
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.820]   so what's your regular Thanksgiving tradition?
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.580]   What do you guys usually do?
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.460]   And I think in situations where we end up
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.020]   with a motley crew at our table,
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.660]   or you end up at somebody else's house
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.940]   that you don't know well,
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.900]   with a bunch of people that you don't know well,
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.140]   what's a girl to do?
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.060]   Well, the power of a well-timed question
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.740]   cannot be underestimated.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.500]   So think in advance,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.700]   what are some things that you,
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.700]   think about what you would like to share?
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.580]   What do you wish somebody would ask you
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.620]   and give you a chance to share a special holiday memory?
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.540]   So ask those kinds of questions,
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.140]   because all that usually,
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.500]   and for some reason we frequently end up
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.180]   with motley crews of people at our house on holidays.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.100]   And so I have been so blessed over the years
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.940]   to look out and see these new relationships
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.740]   that have been forged between people
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.300]   who, if they had not both ended up at our house
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.140]   for a holiday,
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.820]   they would have never have known each other.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.220]   Because somebody asked a question and got them talking,
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.260]   they have found all manner of things in common.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.420]   And all manner of things to be interested in,
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.580]   in one another.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.660]   Another thing, Amy, that I have found,
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.020]   and I'd love to know if this is true for you,
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.140]   that I have found that breaks the ice,
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.660]   is to give everybody a job.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.380]   - Yes, yes, I agree.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.340]   - Why is that so freeing, do you think?
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.300]   - I think it levels the playing field a little bit.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.420]   I feel like there's a difference
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.820]   between hosting and entertaining.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.500]   You know, we don't have,
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.460]   I don't have like in the 1800 servants
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.180]   that are seating you at the table.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.500]   And I don't want to,
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.900]   and otherwise if I'm doing it alone,
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.980]   I'm very flurried because it's a big,
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.980]   it's an undertaking to feed 15 or 20 people.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.180]   That's a lot.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.060]   So having particular jobs,
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.820]   now there are jobs that I go,
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.980]   I'd really rather do that myself.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.460]   - Exactly.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.780]   But you know those jobs,
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.460]   you know what will stress you to pass on,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.660]   and that would just be a blessing to somebody.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.620]   - Yeah, or have them bring something.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.860]   Even a person, we have an older single man
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.620]   that has come to dinner to us,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.020]   and I'm like, can you bring a loaf of bread?
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.380]   You know, it's something that you don't have to cook,
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.900]   you don't have to ask.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.540]   You know, can you bring me cans of cranberry sauce?
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.660]   Can you help me put that in a bowl?
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.660]   And also your expectation is to include
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.980]   and have fun.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.980]   Like as they're chopping vegetables or arranging,
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.380]   give them a job like,
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.300]   hey, can you arrange these carrots and celery on a dish?
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.660]   And if they're nervous or I've had guests like,
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.660]   oh, how do you want it?
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.020]   Like, I don't care.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.820]   You know, you have the freedom to make it fun.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.820]   You know, and I think that that includes people.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.500]   A good friend of ours, they always had a puzzle out.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.980]   - Oh, yes.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.900]   - Because some people she said are shy and quiet,
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.260]   but they can sit around and put together a puzzle
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.020]   with some other people.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.620]   And you can have a little conversation
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.100]   and it's off to the side.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.580]   - Right, or a new conversation and just be together.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.060]   - Yes, yes.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.380]   So I think that's to me what that, you know,
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.620]   asking people to help means.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.740]   And you can kind of pick up on who's comfortable with that
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.980]   and who's maybe that's not their thing, you know.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.860]   So you can just invite them.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.060]   But I think that's always fun because you're not the one,
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.260]   I guess I just don't, I'm just so unavailable otherwise.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.740]   - Right, I agree.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.380]   I get really busy on Thanksgiving before it's get,
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.860]   you know, 15 minutes down, you know,
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.980]   15 minutes from eat time.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.340]   I am busy and I don't really want to talk to you
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.780]   about all the things.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.940]   I want to do all the things.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.500]   So yes, having things, activities that have put other people
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.020]   to work or given them something to do happily
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.340]   is really, really good.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   Go ahead.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.180]   - It's still going to be crazy.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.020]   Things are still going to happen.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.460]   And things are not going to be up
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.220]   to what your expectations are.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.740]   Are things are going to get spilt?
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.140]   Or it's going to get burned?
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.580]   Or someone's going to forget?
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.660]   Are someone else's kids are going to drive you crazy?
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.500]   I mean, it's just--
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.300]   - Yes, it's going to happen.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.740]   - I think it's like you keep putting that relationship,
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.420]   those relationships front and center.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.100]   What is eternal here?
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.420]   - Yes, yes.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.260]   - And keep, as someone told me, keep the long view.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.340]   When they leave the house,
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.980]   they want, you want them to leave feeling loved,
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.780]   well-loved, if you can.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.620]   - Not like they were an imposition
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.300]   or they stayed too long or ate too much
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.180]   or their children did X.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:24.300]   You want them to think, man, I felt part of that family.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.540]   That was fun.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.060]   I would do that again.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.580]   And who knows, maybe that's why you end up
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.460]   with a motley crew of people that come back.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.300]   So who knows?
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.140]   - Exactly.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.580]   - I know we are looking, we're talking about,
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.340]   y'all, ways to simplify things.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.700]   Simplify your school routine.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.340]   Simplify your holiday celebration.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.180]   Simplify your hosting.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.180]   And as I was thinking about this, Amy,
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.300]   I thought, man, those scribbler's verbs
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.340]   that we worked on all those, that time back,
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.900]   those scribbler's verbs are really applicable
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.420]   and they're not just for four to eight-year-olds, y'all.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.380]   The scribbler's verbs are awesome.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:10.380]   They help us relax while we are doing things with purpose
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.660]   and we are playing with intention.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.460]   And they're not just for little people.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.340]   They can help us do life together
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.180]   in a way that really covers all the bases
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.500]   while we are still essentially playing and taking breaks.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.860]   So Amy, help us, I want you, okay,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.260]   remind people what the scribbler's verbs are.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.300]   And then for the last minutes that you and I have together,
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.420]   we are gonna brainstorm some ways
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.420]   that each one of these verbs can help us
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.940]   embrace the holidays together,
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.380]   drawing families together, including our guests.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.260]   So how can we draw our families
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:56.260]   and draw our guests into the celebration of the season
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.180]   using scribbler's verbs?
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.300]   Okay, so tell us what they are first
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.340]   and then we'll start one by one.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.180]   - I love that.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.540]   And there's one word that is in every one of the verbs.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.140]   So we pray together, we play together,
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.140]   we read together, we explore together,
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.260]   and we serve together.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.260]   And that is because our relationships are what,
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.980]   I love that in the, this is in the scribbler's guide,
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.860]   our relationships draw us into learning.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.420]   And I think that that being together,
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.420]   so praying, just what we are, we do,
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.980]   starting our day, those rhythms of the day
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.020]   of incorporating each one of these
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.180]   as we move through the day
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.740]   and recognizing when that happens.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.380]   Sometimes that's really intentional on our part.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.860]   And other times we can just delightfully go,
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.740]   wow, we just read something together
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.780]   and I didn't have to put it on a list.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.620]   We just met.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.180]   - Yes, it just happened.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.180]   It became part of the family rhythm.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.180]   And that is very relaxing.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.940]   It's very refreshing.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.980]   I love what you said.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.860]   It doesn't have to be a plan.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.380]   That, I am a planner.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.740]   I mean, I have a list.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.980]   My kids, one time, one of my girl's friends said,
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.420]   I bet your mom has a list of lists.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.180]   And my daughter very seriously said, oh, she does.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.820]   It's that blue book right there.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.620]   And I was like, oh my gosh, I do.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.180]   I have a list, a book that's a list of my list.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.740]   But everything doesn't have to be planned.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:43.740]   And if you develop a family rhythm of these five things,
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:49.780]   you will discover that your life has become enriched
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.700]   and you are intentionally doing these things,
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.580]   but you didn't have to plan it.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.860]   So let's talk about,
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   so we're thinking together about ways that we can,
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.420]   first of all, let's do pray together.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.940]   And these are ways that you as your family can,
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.780]   and you could do this all through the year.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.700]   It doesn't have to just be at the holidays,
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.180]   but if you're trying to simplify for the holiday,
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.620]   but you feel compelled to make sure
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.260]   that you're doing things together
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.100]   and that you are teaching your children
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.700]   about the power of routine
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.820]   and the power of a learning relational rhythm
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.060]   where you do life together.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.740]   This is a great place to start.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.620]   So let's start with praying.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:43.100]   Amy, how can we teach our children to pray
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.220]   for all their circles of people?
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.940]   And by circles, I mean, your children,
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.620]   the people in your home,
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.660]   when their kids are little,
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.220]   they start by praying for their family
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.380]   and then they pray for their extended family
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.540]   and then their friends,
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.540]   and then they'll pray for people in their neighborhood
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.860]   or at church.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   So how do we teach our children
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.460]   to pray for all their circles?
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.820]   - I think, first we model, by example,
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.100]   that prayer is just the opportunity
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.220]   to talk directly with the Lord
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.980]   and be honest before him.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   But I think it is helpful to help children
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:30.660]   understand that prayer is a conversation with the Lord.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.660]   And so that means I'm still or quiet.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.260]   I think posture,
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.860]   if you want them to fold their hands
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.020]   because they're not punching or pinching.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.860]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:48.060]   - And if you want them to bow their heads or kneel,
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:53.060]   just thinking through just how we approach the Lord
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.780]   and that's just your family tradition.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.980]   And then I always thought it was a neat idea
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.540]   to have something like a physical.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.540]   So there's this nice little,
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.700]   Child Evangelism Fellowship has the praying hand.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.020]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.580]   - It was like your little finger
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.140]   'cause you're a small person
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.580]   that you can pray for yourself.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.300]   Like what's on your mind?
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.740]   Sometimes we skip that.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.580]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.660]   - You pray for yourself.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.220]   What are some things you're worried about
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.220]   or maybe things you're thankful for or you want?
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.700]   You know, our little ones
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.260]   we're always praying for Christmas, you know.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.100]   - Yes, yes.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.420]   - That's okay.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.380]   God is very gracious and we pray for things too.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.620]   So just asking for it.
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.580]   And then like their little, their ring finger,
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.900]   that's a weak finger.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.940]   So pray for people that you know need help.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.420]   Who are some help that people that you think,
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.940]   and you'll be surprised at who they bring up
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.220]   that they are aware of that need help, that are struggling.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.100]   And then your, like your middle finger,
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.540]   people who are your helpers,
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.380]   like people who are like your parents
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.500]   or your Sunday school teacher or your tutor.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.660]   Think about people or your pastor,
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.740]   people that are your helpers and pray for them.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.780]   And then I love the pointer is that
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.940]   those who point me to Christ.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.060]   - Oh, that's good.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.140]   - To pray for your pastor or pray for your,
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.860]   maybe a leader in your children's church or think,
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.820]   and you'll be surprised, even your tutor,
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.300]   like praying for your,
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.380]   we would pray, you know,
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.260]   a dad at the scout master or something.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.220]   You know, it's interesting who comes up,
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.260]   who are the people that point you to Christ.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.420]   And then your thumb is the people
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.780]   who are the closest to you.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.700]   And so it's like your family or your, you know,
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.460]   and occasionally they would pray for each other.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.860]   - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.100]   - But just having a little,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.860]   just even helping them with that structure
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.620]   or even teaching the Lord's prayer,
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.100]   or I think some of it is teaching and instruction
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.780]   and modeling and then letting them bring their own.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.260]   And of course, it's lovely.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.100]   Like you can have a bowl on the table
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.260]   and you can pick, you know,
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.140]   you can have a Thanksgiving bowl.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:15.980]   - Oh, that's good, yeah.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.100]   - That's what you thanks God for.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.580]   You can pull a bowl
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.540]   where you pull somebody's name out of the hat,
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.020]   let them put some people name
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.700]   and you pray for them that day.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.660]   You can ask if there are particular answers to prayer.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.500]   I think that's something we did,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.460]   kept a little quick journal.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.860]   Like we pray for this and where's the answer?
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.420]   You know, watching for that and seeing how God.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.340]   So those are things that I think just keeping,
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.220]   prayer is very personal.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.380]   And I think not making it something where,
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.540]   if someone's not comfortable praying,
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.780]   little guys, you know, singing a song instead
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.060]   or not, and just, or praying for them.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.860]   You know, I think being really sweet
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.220]   and, you know, putting your arm around them,
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.980]   praying for them when they've had a hard time,
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.380]   or sometimes we'd pray before one particular child
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.860]   had a math.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.300]   - Yes, yes.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.860]   - And so we just pray over like,
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.620]   Lord, would you help us with this
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.260]   and help us to not be worried or anxious
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.860]   and just a simple prayer.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.860]   - Yeah, and so many of those things you can do,
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.500]   even when you have guests in your home,
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.140]   you can incorporate people into that.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.780]   Everybody understands a thankful bowl
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.740]   where you put in a blessing.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.420]   Or one thing that our family has done
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.620]   is when we get Christmas cards through the year,
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.420]   I put them in a basket and then we pray at night.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.660]   - Nice, yes.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.260]   - At our evening meal and sometimes afterwards,
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.020]   we pray for the cards that we pray for the families.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.860]   And so everybody can do that.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.420]   And, you know, there's always card,
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.900]   I pick a card and my kids are like,
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.740]   who is that?
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.220]   Why are we praying for that?
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.380]   They don't remember these distant relatives
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.900]   or these college roommates.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:04.140]   And so it's easy to include other people
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.300]   in those kinds of activities.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.300]   And I think it's lovely.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.900]   People like being drawn into your family rhythms,
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.700]   especially if they're not pressured to participate.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.580]   So like if they don't want to pray out loud,
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.660]   then we never do that,
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.940]   but we ask them to be with us as we pray.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.060]   And I just, I think that's really good.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.820]   One of the things that I love doing
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.260]   is that you could do as a family
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.260]   is like make a prayer journal.
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:42.260]   It is very encouraging for young children
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:48.060]   to see that, oh look, five pages back,
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.780]   there was this request and we prayed for it as a family
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.940]   and look what God has done.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.100]   - Yes, yes.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.540]   - And if you don't write it down,
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.300]   sometimes you, I have been shocked
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.420]   sometimes when I've gone back through a journal
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.860]   and seen how many times God answered something
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.700]   that I just kind of rattled off
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.100]   'cause I had to say something.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.620]   God bless this or God take care of that.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.780]   And then, you know, eight pages ahead,
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.860]   I look back and God has done all these things.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.700]   - Yes.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.020]   - And just to see the hand of God.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.420]   And okay, how do we play together?
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.420]   How can play be a way that we learn about the Lord
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.860]   or learn about our family or learn about ourselves?
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.380]   How can play help us?
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.660]   - Oh, I think having, first of all,
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.980]   the spirit of playfulness and humor.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.820]   - Yes, I love it.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.700]   - And just that things are silly.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.900]   You know, Christmas isn't just, you know,
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.980]   we're just gonna think about, you know, Jesus, no offense.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.300]   We do wanna think about Jesus,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.940]   but there's so much delight and there's good food
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.300]   and there's beauty.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.580]   And all of that are blessings from the Lord.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.380]   So recognizing that we can have humor.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.020]   And I always felt like it was nice
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.580]   to keep things pretty simple,
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.980]   like play a game together that's not highly competitive.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.500]   Now, my boys would play highly competitive.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.100]   - Oh my gosh, yes, yes.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.300]   - With these long board games.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.460]   No, I did not do that.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.060]   But if you wanna play like old mates
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.380]   or especially for little guys, like a matching game.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.100]   Like sometimes we made those stickers
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   that were, you know, Christmas stickers
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.500]   and put 'em on index cards.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.260]   - You know what, Amy, you said a matching game.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.900]   One thing that I did when my girls were really little,
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.540]   before the holidays, I would, now, okay,
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.060]   admittedly, this is back in the day
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.780]   when you had film developed, okay?
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.860]   So that's how old I am.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.860]   But I would take pictures of family members
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.140]   that we were gonna see
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.860]   that I knew they probably didn't remember.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.500]   And I made a matching game out of 'em.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.700]   Like I would cover the back of it with a piece of felt.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.300]   And then we probably had a concentration game.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.100]   So they got to see, this is Aunt Michelle.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.180]   This is, you know, this is Uncle John.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.660]   Oh, that's Nana and Raleigh.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.220]   That's Pawpaw, you know?
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.660]   So they would identify those.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.020]   So yeah, matching games are awesome for that.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:10.860]   - Are so fun.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.500]   And you can get pretty cheap photographs
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.940]   from your digital stuff now.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.260]   - Yeah, you certainly can.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.740]   - And that makes it really fun.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.620]   And sometimes we made,
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.700]   one of the things Witt really loved is we made
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.660]   like a folder.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.420]   We took a manila folder and made our own game
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.340]   where it was let's find dad or something.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.180]   I can't remember.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.500]   It was like, and it was hilarious
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.140]   because some of the things,
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:39.220]   like dad's lost his, you know, whatever, glasses.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.460]   And so it was long, you know?
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.220]   And it was like, we rolled the dice
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.340]   and you'd have to go back
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.180]   and, you know, make him a hot cup of tea.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.340]   You know, it was just something very goofy,
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.940]   but any, and it wasn't about winning it,
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.460]   but it was, and it was just fun.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.100]   Like something where people can sit around the table
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.260]   and that's where like simple puzzles
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.060]   and everyone's invited,
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.020]   especially, and little guys can sit on your lap,
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.620]   you know, like they can play or not.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.140]   You can modify.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:07.980]   - Yes, yes.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.220]   - You can apply the rules, you know?
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.060]   And, but just getting people together
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.180]   or making something like really making cookies
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.420]   or popcorn or do something
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:25.780]   where you're playfully incorporating other people.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.820]   You're doing it together.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.060]   So you would like for people to be together.
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.420]   - Yes, where the process is the point,
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.860]   not the product, okay?
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.540]   So that we are just all participating
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.540]   in this silly activity.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.540]   It's not about what we make
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.140]   or what we've created at the end.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.060]   You know, moms, if you are really,
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.100]   if you really want,
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.540]   if you just really need to bring
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.900]   some of that academic stuff in,
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.700]   let your littlest learners share
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.380]   one or two weeks worth of the timeline.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.220]   - Yes.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:06.420]   - With grownups and let them lead the grownups
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.700]   in a memory game.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.460]   You talk about leveling the playing field,
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.940]   that will sure do it.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.260]   And so everybody can, all the grownups can learn together
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.420]   and the little kids can be in charge.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.820]   And they might truly love that.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.620]   That's super fun.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.340]   So play, you already mentioned some things
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.060]   that you can read together.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.580]   You can have,
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:33.940]   you can even let people put in a pile.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.900]   We used to do this.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.020]   We let everybody put in five things,
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:41.580]   five stories or five books that they love.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.780]   And we would take turns reading from those things.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.860]   - If you have, and traditional stories
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.060]   that you just read every year,
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.980]   even if kids roll their eyes after a while.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.820]   It's so fun.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.580]   We always read "The Night Before Christmas"
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.060]   and we always read "The Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.980]   and we always read "And Wood Always Cries"
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.100]   and "It Was So Lovely" and, you know,
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.140]   and we read "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever."
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.100]   You know, if there's certain things that catch your fancy
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.420]   and if they don't, you can put them aside.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.660]   But I think that having reading,
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.260]   and then I think part of the reading is,
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.620]   as we're doing the Christmas story,
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.300]   just really embellishing that with like acting it out
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.660]   or having someone narrate.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.900]   Hey, have your littlest one narrate it back.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.340]   You know, tell me what's your favorite part
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.340]   of the Christmas story and share that one evening.
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.420]   I mean, you, it's just so fun.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.300]   Just ask a good question.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:39.060]   Hey, what, who's your favorite character
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.340]   in the Christmas story, why?
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.300]   And then if you have a crush,
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.380]   we always had, you know, different ones around
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:51.820]   that you kids could actually, you know, play with,
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.980]   you know, not super fancy.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.980]   And just using that and just talking about that story,
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.820]   that is such a beautiful story.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.420]   And then just talking about the parts of the story,
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.900]   have someone narrate parts of it back,
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.580]   picking out who their favorite is,
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.060]   their favorite animal at the crash.
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.380]   Uh-huh, yep.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.940]   Like I found, you know, dinosaurs in the crash.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.860]   Oh my gosh, that is so funny.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.340]   I found Lego man in the crash.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.740]   That is so fun.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.940]   Mm-hmm, and I think just making it,
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:28.780]   yeah, that playful, joyfulness of spirit.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.020]   I know that one of my girls' best memories
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.900]   was one that really got me worried when I,
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:41.260]   when they were little, they were like two and four.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.980]   I think they were two and four.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:47.980]   And we lived in a parsonage that was heated with oil
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.780]   and it had a blower and we had a terrible storm
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.980]   and the power went out.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.140]   And in our house, if the power was out,
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.860]   the blower did not work and so we had no heat.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.980]   And so the girls, it was Christmas Eve
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.260]   and the girls were in the bathtub.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.300]   It was in the daytime.
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.700]   I don't even know why I was washing their hair
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.540]   in the daytime.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.300]   They were in the bathtub and the power went utterly out
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.940]   and the bathroom had no natural light.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.500]   So they just thought this was a big hoot.
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.540]   And I, of course, was stroking out because I'm thinking,
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.820]   it's cold, my children are gonna catch pneumonia
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.660]   for Christmas.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.340]   So, I mean, David was building a fire
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.660]   and they, we, you know, pulled them out of the bathtub
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.420]   and had to dry their hair with towels.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.860]   Of course, no hairdryer would work without power.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.260]   In front of the fire and we put blankets out
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.940]   and we brought some of their toys in.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.260]   They thought this was like the best thing ever
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.780]   'cause daddy is playing with us
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.340]   and we're getting to bring our big toys
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.900]   into the living room and we're in front of the fire.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.620]   And so their favorite thing we decided,
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.100]   'cause it was lasting a long time,
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.540]   so we acted out the Christmas story.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.380]   - Oh, yes.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.180]   - And they went and got all manner of props and things,
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.980]   then drug it into my clean living room.
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.620]   And they look back on that as one of their most fun things.
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:08.020]   And we spent hours telling the story over and over
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.140]   till we can get it just right for the older one,
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.300]   had to be just right.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.860]   And everybody had to do their part just right.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:18.100]   So we actually eventually ended up filming that.
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.420]   David's parents came the next day and we acted it out
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.260]   and we have that.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.340]   Papa put it on video for us.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.820]   And so that's a way, that's a story.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.860]   That is a story they had read a hundred times.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.140]   And so they knew what the story was.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.820]   And so you can act it out.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.740]   You can draw pictures of it.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.580]   - Oh, yes.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.420]   - You can make a movie of it.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.740]   You can do a radio play.
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:47.140]   Your kids will get into telling the stories
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.940]   and reading stories in different ways.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.900]   That is so awesome.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.140]   I love the whole idea of exploring together.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.980]   And something that you said at the beginning, Amy,
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:02.540]   about just using it as a time to explore God's creation.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.380]   - Yes.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.180]   - Really absorbing the beauty of this season outside.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.820]   But how else can we, can explore be one of those verbs
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.140]   that draws a family together?
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.300]   - Well, you know, there is the outside.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.860]   You know, you can also, it's a quiet season.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.020]   You know, there's usually not a lot of people
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.100]   at the parks or anything like that.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.340]   It's a good place.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.700]   And the birds need to be fed.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.300]   And little creatures, you can hide.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.340]   They're hiding and sleeping.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.500]   So those are good things to do.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:42.260]   But inside, and you're doing more inside things.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.620]   I would say instead of keeping it like,
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.500]   oh, we're gonna do an activity now.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:52.900]   Think through what are the activities that I have to do?
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:57.620]   Like, am I gonna make a jam for, you know, a gift?
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.300]   Or am I gonna assemble something in the kitchen?
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:06.300]   Am I gonna cook something that I don't normally cook?
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:11.780]   Then bring them in and start having conversations about,
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.900]   well, why do we put baking soda in this cake?
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.980]   And, you know, you can incorporate them
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.980]   into the exploring like the different spices.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.180]   And let's look up where these spices are from.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:27.060]   Let's explore that a little bit
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.100]   or let them pick something out
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.220]   that maybe they would like to cook or make.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.340]   And that you can incorporate that in the day.
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.340]   That's very science-y.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.980]   You can incorporate, you can do a million things
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.980]   with just getting a hundred coffee filters.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.260]   - Ooh, that's very true.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.980]   - And clothespins and make a bazillion either,
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.580]   well, you can either say they're angels or butterflies.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.540]   It doesn't matter.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.020]   - Yes, yes.
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:02.180]   - And if you just watch, you know, dip it in water
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.300]   and watch the colors bleed, you know,
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.340]   get some Epsom salt.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.980]   That's the cheapest form of glitter you're gonna find.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:15.220]   Make, look at it, watch it dissolve.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.180]   Does it dissolve easily in hot water or cold water?
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.780]   You know, melt stuff, make cookies
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.140]   like those stained glass cookies
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.700]   where you put cookies in and watch it melt.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:29.420]   You know, just what is hot chocolate?
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.220]   You know, making things and just recognizing
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.540]   how do your senses, what do you smell?
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.420]   And if you want to put like,
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:37.940]   let's put a candy cane in this one
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:40.660]   and let's put, you know, sprinkles in that one.
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.740]   And just how do they taste differently
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.060]   and why do they taste?
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:49.060]   And just, I think is sometimes we add a lot of things
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.740]   that may be recognizing,
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.140]   oh, we've got to make all those extra presents.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:56.740]   You know, the presents that you make
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:00.060]   for all the extra people in your life.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:04.420]   Well, incorporate them in helping you make those presents.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.020]   There's nothing more encouraging
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.340]   than getting a salt door Christmas ornament.
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:14.340]   You know, that is really, that is so much fun.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.580]   And to see this as a homemade gift
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.380]   and it's something that you did
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.940]   with your kids in your home.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.220]   And there's so many things.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.700]   I mean, I would avoid Pinterest and so on.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.340]   - Right, right.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.580]   - But also just glance over things that you think,
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:36.660]   ooh, that would be a really easy thing to do
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.140]   and get the kids around.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.180]   Also, one thing is since we're in community
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:44.580]   for those 12 weeks, as you're in community,
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.740]   circle those experiments that they love.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:53.140]   - Yes, redo something you explored over the semester.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.180]   And yeah, I love that.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.860]   - Yes, that is so fun.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.220]   - There are lots of times that our children
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.900]   are super interested in what we're doing right now.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.500]   And in the heat of the semester,
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.740]   we say, but we must move on.
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:09.580]   - Yes.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.700]   - We must move on when really,
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.140]   we don't must do anything really.
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:17.140]   So go back, go back to those things
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.580]   that people still had an interest in
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.140]   or still had a question.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.620]   This goes for younger children and older children.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:29.860]   There are grownups that whose interest was piqued
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.740]   by a history sentence or by something
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:36.380]   that their challenge student was researching.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.340]   And you had more questions,
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.780]   but not enough time to chase those rabbits.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.580]   Chase the rabbit all holiday season.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.820]   Let it be a chasing of the rabbits
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:49.980]   and explore together all of the things
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.420]   that people wondered about
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.740]   and you didn't have time to satisfy the curiosity.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   That's an awesome way to do that.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.700]   Okay, serve.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.540]   Where does serving begin, Amy?
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.300]   - Oh, well, first in your home.
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.460]   You know, when you do chores,
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.900]   you're serving your family.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:12.180]   And to help them see that there are opportunities
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.580]   that you can lighten the load.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.420]   Christ lightens our load.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.740]   He bears our burdens.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:22.380]   And so to recognize and that service is not just,
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:25.820]   you know, it can be collecting food at a food bank.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:29.740]   You know, it can be where you do it together as a family,
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.340]   but making the connection with the people you're serving.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.820]   So that can be a visit to a neighbor.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.980]   I mean, last Christmas, all the kids were like,
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.620]   we were getting squirrely and was like,
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.340]   all right, put on your jacket.
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.700]   We're gonna walk up and down.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.100]   It was like, are you kidding?
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.460]   We're gonna walk up and down the street
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:49.740]   and we're gonna sing carols.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.220]   No, we are not singers.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.780]   And we had like seven down to one.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.980]   So we went to our neighbors and knocked on their door.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.180]   We have several that live alone.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.460]   And we just kind of sang.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.860]   It was kind of awkward because I wanted to sing
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.660]   kind of weird Christmas songs.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   We sang them with, we were boisterously saying,
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.780]   we made noise.
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.860]   And then we had some kids.
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.620]   One of my granddaughters said,
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:22.900]   let's give them a candy cane 'cause she loves candy canes.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.180]   So we gave them a little candy cane.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.100]   And you know, that was, they had the best time.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:31.260]   And it was so easy.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:35.140]   And just making a connection with the person
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.700]   that we're helping or we're serving.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.940]   I think sitting with someone, you know,
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.020]   just sitting, visiting, nursing home.
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:48.540]   We had one very close by that we would just go
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:52.740]   and like hand, give them something to do though.
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:57.380]   Don't like hand them a card that you made or something.
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.460]   But I think that helps.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:03.420]   I think helping children recognize
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.780]   that they have something to offer to someone else
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:10.780]   that is a good taste of what serving is about.
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.500]   So, and of course you can do Operation Christmas Child Boxes
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.300]   and you can be involved in your church's activities.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.900]   But I like having the connection
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.180]   with the people that we're serving.
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.620]   - One of the best ways to begin this
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:29.060]   is at the holiday season when you teach your children,
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.660]   little children and older children,
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:37.780]   that they serve your family's guests well
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.420]   when they draw them into your family.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:44.860]   So practice how to talk to strangers.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.620]   Practice with your little children.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.540]   What do you say when you meet someone?
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:55.340]   What's a good question that you could ask somebody else
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:57.540]   so they will tell you about themselves.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.580]   When we teach our children to love well
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:06.340]   the people that come to our home, we are serving them.
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.940]   And that's a beautiful way for us,
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.220]   especially during the holidays,
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.420]   to welcome people to our home and to love them.
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.100]   Amy, thank you so much.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.980]   I feel like we have lots of good ideas together
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:26.140]   about how to simplify the holidays
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.900]   but make it deeply meaningful,
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:31.740]   both for our families and for people who join us.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:35.780]   I hope, listeners, that you have enjoyed this podcast
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.540]   and that maybe you'll go back and listen to it again
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.300]   or pass it on to a friend who's wondering
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.140]   what to do with the Motley crew,
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   that they have a symbol for the holidays.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.180]   I know that life is busy,
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.820]   but people are looking for good ideas.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.260]   And I also want to let you guys know
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:59.260]   that our podcast is a wealth of interesting
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.580]   and mostly good ideas,
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.740]   but there's another place that you can listen
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.020]   for great ideas.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:09.980]   Even when you're busy, you don't have to miss out
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.940]   some of our catalog articles
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:17.940]   in the upcoming 2025 Classical Conversations catalog,
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:23.020]   such as The Need for Community and His Grace is Sufficient
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.620]   and Skills to Love Your Neighbor,
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.140]   which goes right along with this podcast.
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:33.140]   Those articles can actually be listened to
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.060]   as well as read.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.860]   So you can actually download audio versions
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.980]   of articles from the catalog and listen to them
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.820]   while you're in the car, while you're working out,
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.060]   while you're baking for the holidays.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.860]   You can even forward an episode to your friend.
