[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   A number of people I know have mold issues.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.040]   They claim or they believe that mold has infiltrated their lungs.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.520]   Some doctors tell them they're crazy.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.520]   Some doctors tell them that they're not crazy about that idea.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.820]   Is mold toxicity a real thing?
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.040]   Can it be treated?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   Maybe we do an entire episode about this another time, but is it a real thing?
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.640]   And what is the kind of primary treatment for mold toxicity?
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.120]   It is a real thing.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.320]   And mold is a substance that can have multiple different effects on the body.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.400]   Let me give you an example.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.520]   There's a fungus called aspergillus.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.920]   And there's two ways that aspergillus can affect the human body.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.040]   One is if it just sets up shop in your lungs and it doesn't invade, you could become allergic
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040]   to it.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.240]   And the symptoms are allergic.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.840]   Actually, there's a condition called allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.600]   So it's kind of like an autoimmune situation.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   Exactly.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.320]   And so you have symptoms of asthma.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.920]   You have symptoms of inability to breathe.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.200]   And the primary treatment, ironically, there is steroids because you need to reduce the
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.760]   inflammation, but also antifungals to get rid of the thing that's inciting in the first
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.000]   place.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.300]   That's as opposed to invasive aspergillosis.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.640]   That's where the fungus comes in and starts to invade and create a cavitary lesion, usually
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.560]   with a fungus ball sitting in the middle of it.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.680]   Oh, yeah, it's pretty bad.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.000]   Sometimes it's so bad that you actually have to do surgery to cut out that thing because
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.840]   you can't cure it.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.980]   The way that this often happens is mold and fungus are in the air all the time.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.720]   So here's this understanding of there's germ theory and there is terrain theory.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.640]   And today, and I almost hate to even get into it, but people think it's one or the other.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.100]   And I can tell you as a physician, it's both.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.680]   There are certain diseases, it doesn't matter what your terrain is, it's going to, like
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.560]   Neisseria meningitidis, if you get that, it's going to cause a bad meningitis, no matter
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   how healthy you are.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.500]   There was just, I remember reading about a young Japanese star, I think, or Taiwanese
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.680]   star just recently here that died of influenza, 48 years old, no medical problems.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.160]   So it's possible no matter how good your terrain is, you could get a bad bug, a bad germ, and
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.160]   it could kill you.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.560]   On the other hand, there are certain bugs that are just sitting out there and they will
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.720]   go in and your immune system will just kick it out like it's nothing.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   Why?
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.880]   Because your terrain is good.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.200]   So I can talk about different types of infections that could do that.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.280]   So that's where we are with molds.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.920]   So typically, you're breathing in all sorts of molds and fungus spores all the time.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.400]   But if your immune system is good, it'll just kick it out and won't have a chance to survive.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.640]   Where you have a problem is if you have a situation where your immune system is compromised.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.920]   To give you an example of that, practically, there are some biological medications that
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.980]   people get when they have rheumatoid arthritis.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.920]   If we get to that point where you have rheumatitis so bad that we have to put you on a biologic,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.960]   that means there's an antibody there that's suppressing the immune system so that you
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.400]   don't have the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.380]   That's actually suppressing your immune system.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.960]   In those patients, we'll always check them for tuberculosis because certain people walking
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.240]   in the population will have an inactivated tuberculosis.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.080]   They're infected, but their immune system has walled it off.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.040]   Then we put them on a biologic, and the tuberculosis pops up.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.240]   So all of that to say that, yes, it is possible if you have mold in your house versus if you
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.320]   don't have mold in your house.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.720]   That just increases the burden of mold that you're inhaling.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.760]   And to the degree that it's going to match against your immune system, that could depend
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.320]   on whether or not it jumps in and actually causes a problem.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.220]   So we're coming up--this is the time of year where we're coming up to the Super Bowl.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.060]   So it's the question about terrain theory versus germ theory.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.080]   And the question is, whoever wins the Super Bowl, did they win the Super Bowl or did the
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.200]   other team lose the Super Bowl?
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.880]   And that's--who knows?
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.920]   So this is where this thing--it's not or, it's and.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.440]   And really what determines whether or not you get infected is how good is your immune
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.240]   system and how virulent is the burden of a pathogen that's going in.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.320]   The reason I asked, is it a real thing, is that people that I know who believe they have
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.720]   a mold infection or they did do seem to have symptoms that last a long time.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.600]   And there doesn't seem to be any general agreement about what specific treatment to use for this
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.580]   unless maybe they need surgery or something.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.400]   So do you give people antifungals?
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.460]   Are there--is there anything over the counter that can help?
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.540]   Will the sauna protocols and steam protocols we were talking about earlier help?
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.080]   I would imagine a lot of warm, moist air is exactly what fungus loves.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yes, it does.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.400]   If someone came to me with mold, with a mold complaint or thinking they had mold, there
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   are a number of tests that you can do to see whether or not there's antibodies to those
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.840]   things and you can see whether or not that may or may not be there.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.540]   It's not definitive.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.380]   But if somebody actually, truly has mold growing in their lungs, we should be able to see that
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.440]   on a CAT scan.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.200]   We should be able to identify it.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.720]   We should be able to go and biopsy it.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.320]   We should be able to go and collect it.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.240]   And if that's exactly what grows out in the culture after we take a biopsy or a culture,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.340]   then we can tailor antifungals for that particular thing.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.580]   In the sense, though, that someone may be having symptoms of some sort of infection
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.440]   or something and there's nothing on the CAT scan, it's harder to really isolate exactly
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.040]   which one it would be and what would be the right treatment.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:04.200]   Although, there are some syndromes known as RADS or reactive airways disease, where you
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.400]   can have an exposure to something that's so egregious that even though you don't get exposed
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.320]   to that thing again, it can still cause persistent difficulty with breathing.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.360]   It's very similar, by the way, to asthma.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.560]   So for instance, let's say someone's working in a vat and there's a chemical that's spilled
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.880]   and they get an incredible amount of inhalation of that chemical.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.240]   It's well-known that these people can go on and have these types of problems, even though
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.580]   their lungs may image correctly and they may never be exposed to that chemical again.
