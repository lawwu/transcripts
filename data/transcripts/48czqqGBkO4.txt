[00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.540]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.860]   This episode was hosted by the Bogleheads Pre and Early Retirement and Retired Life
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.460]   Stage Chapters and recorded February 21st, 2024.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.820]   The presentation features an open discussion on the Bogleheads Conference Panel Discussion
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.520]   on Advice for Pre-Retirees and Retirees found on the Bogleheads YouTube channel.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.140]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.740]   investment advice.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.700]   To talk about, I just posted in the chat a link to an interesting thread that just started
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.940]   on the forum about the concept of a rising equity or a bond tent approach in retirement.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.700]   That's the Wade Fow and Michael Kitsis study, which has been somewhat controversial.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.060]   I'm not going to go into detail about the concept there other than the fact that some
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.780]   of us that are doing Roth conversions in retirement, at least in early retirement, end up forcing
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.060]   ourselves into a rising equity glide path.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.260]   That's certainly happened with me because my IRA is 100% bonds and as I'm doing substantial
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.540]   Roth conversions in the early years of retirement and then having 100% converting those fixed
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.100]   income to 100% equities in my Roth, that's shifting my asset allocation higher and higher
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.460]   in equities.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.100]   I'm also spending down the CD ladder that I had created for early retirement.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.380]   I've gone from about a 50% equity allocation when I started retirement into about a 64%
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.340]   equity allocation now.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.260]   It'll probably, depending upon the market, continue to rise, but it's an interesting
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.500]   concept to read up on both the concept of a bond tent, which may or may not be useful
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.740]   to minimize sequence of returns risk.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.860]   It's still a relatively new concept and we don't have any long-term data as yet, as far
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.140]   as I know from Michael Kitsis or Wade Fow, on how well it holds up, but it's certainly
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.660]   something to consider as you approach and prepare for retirement or are already in retirement.
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.620]   Can you give us a quick what's a tent?
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.620]   What does that mean?
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.940]   Well, the idea basically is to increase your bond allocation, fixed income allocation as
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.660]   you approach retirement much higher.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.380]   He used to say typically that you would want to have increasing bond holdings as you move
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.940]   through retirement with age, was it age minus something in bonds, 100 minus your age in
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.680]   bonds or something to that effect, and that your bond allocation increases in retirement.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.100]   But Michael Kitsis and Wade Fow did a study where if you start off with a very high bond
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.740]   allocation and do the reverse, where you basically spend that down in the early days and let
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.820]   your equity allocation rise, that that may provide some protection if you have a poor
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.540]   sequence of returns situation in early retirement.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.460]   There are arguments for and against it.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.040]   I don't know how many people practice it.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.220]   Is there anybody here on this Zoom who have played around with that and are putting it
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.220]   into practice?
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.420]   If I can be so bold, I'm doing that exact thing.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.540]   I'm doing an 80/20 portfolio, and I've been heavily into bonds and heavily into cash.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.740]   And to tell you the truth, I took a bath in my bonds.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.340]   With rates increasing, my bonds took a dive.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340]   The cash has been pretty nice.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:51.260]   I get their CDs and their money market accounts, and they're just strictly interest earned.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.660]   So you tell me, what am I doing wrong?
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.260]   Well, last year was like a hundred-year storm as far as the bond market and what happened.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.740]   In retrospect, it makes perfect sense because of the rapid rise of interest rates by the
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.740]   Fed.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.900]   So what happened is expected.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.660]   But the fact of the matter is if people stay the course and just hang on and let the bond
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.260]   market recover, it's partially recovered, it'll take some time.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.900]   But it's unlikely to happen again.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.660]   In fact, if and when the Fed starts lowering rates, the reverse should occur where we start
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.420]   seeing that the market price of bonds is going up, and we'll get further recovery from that.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.940]   The key thing to know, and I think a lot of people aren't aware of this, that the expected
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.940]   return from a bond fund is basically whatever the yield to maturity is at the time you purchase
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.660]   shares in the fund.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:59.860]   So if the total bond market has a yield to maturity of, say, 4.5% now, whatever it is,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.340]   if you hold it at least for its duration, which is about six to seven years, and then
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.580]   some, barring any huge changes in interest rates, you should get that return long term.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.120]   So starting at this point, we should see pretty good returns from the bond funds, total bond
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.940]   market fund, if you hold on to it.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.940]   And then you may get additional return as interest rates fall and bond prices go up,
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.580]   and the market price of the bond fund will go up as well, giving an additional yield
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.820]   for you if you sell it.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.460]   - Okay, now let me throw you one more curveball.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.020]   Big picture time, I was 80/20 stock, 80% stocks, 20% bonds.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.780]   My stocks and my stock funds have been doing spectacularly.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.060]   They're doing really well.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.480]   My bonds stink.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.140]   They're terrible.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.620]   Being in retirement, I was under the impression that the bonds were not going to move very
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.620]   much.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.500]   It was going to be my opportunity to keep it steadfast.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.380]   This cash, I subscribe to that bucket theory.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.700]   I put a little bit everywhere so that in fact, as I'm in retirement, the cash is not going
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.780]   to move one way or the other.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.140]   The cash, meaning my bonds, are not going to move one way or the other.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.980]   Well, I found out the exact opposite is true.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.820]   I'm not interested in being in bonds for a long period of time.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.220]   I want the stability of cash.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.620]   Now you tell me, am I thinking wrong?
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.900]   Am I doing something illogical?
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.900]   Hell.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:45.500]   - Well, right now, obviously, cash has a pretty good yield, but you have interest rate risk.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.340]   As interest rates fall, if you're in money markets or short-term T-bills, what are you
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.780]   going to do with that money when it matures?
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.860]   Whereas if you're in a bond fund long-term, you'll reap some of the benefits, but the
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.820]   bonds are there for ballast, as Jack Bogle would say.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.020]   Although we didn't expect, we should have known that this could and would happen, but
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.740]   we were so lackadaisical and comfortable that bonds were going to maintain their value all
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.660]   the way through, but there's no way that low interest rates would have been maintained
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.660]   to this degree.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.980]   They had to go up sooner or later.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.660]   The fact of the matter is, though, if you look, the bonds fell, what, 17%, I think,
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.420]   maybe, total bond market, but they didn't fall as much as stock funds did.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.880]   The total stock market fell worse.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.580]   There's less volatility in the bond market.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.620]   We just got hit hard for one year.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.620]   There's a lesson learned.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.500]   I'd be curious to hear feedback from everybody here as to how they have handled that.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.020]   A lot of us have a significant portion of our portfolio in bonds, and how did you all
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.100]   handle this situation last year, and to some extent, this year?
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.620]   Yeah, Mel, you have your hand up.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:59.020]   Do you want to speak to this?
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.140]   You're muted.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:09.020]   There you go.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.020]   Good hearing you, Mel.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.020]   Muted again.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:17.100]   Let's move over to Laura, and we'll get back to Mel after this.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.100]   Yes.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.100]   I'm about to retire at the end of this month, and my ASA allocation is 50/50.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:34.540]   I chose, and I work for the federal government, so I chose to put my bond allocations in the
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:45.020]   G fund, in my TSP, and mostly I bonds, small smattering, a double E bonds, and the reason
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:54.300]   I picked those vehicles for my bonds is because my understanding that they would not lose
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:01.260]   principal regardless of what the interest rates did, and I found that to be true, especially
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.340]   when all the bonds were dropping in value.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:12.500]   My I bonds did very, very well, as well as in some cases, I was making over, like a little
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:20.540]   over 10% on some of my bonds, but I've been collecting those I bonds for about 15 years
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:28.900]   in anticipation of one day retiring, and if I retired in a bear market, I would have someplace
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:35.620]   to go that for sure would not lose its value, and in the case of I bonds, would at least
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:42.460]   keep up with inflation, and for some of those I bonds that had a fixed rate above zero,
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:48.400]   it would be even a little better than inflation, so that's my only comment.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.940]   You know, the one thing I've heard, and I don't dabble that much in bonds, but one thing
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.460]   I've heard is let's say I get a double E bond at 5%, and then the next day, magically, CDs
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:04.420]   are paying 7%, although I may not lose principal, and it's redeemed at the full face value of
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:11.300]   the bond, technically, I could get 7% somewhere else, so I'm technically kind of losing money
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.780]   even though it doesn't look like it.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:18.660]   I think that's the general argument there, so just to bring that up.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.500]   Except that, you know, they can make, you know, you don't know for how long they'll
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   make 7%.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.900]   No, you're right.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.220]   You're buying a contract, yes.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.300]   It's not buying 10% for, you know, indefinitely.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.300]   Yes.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.180]   Yeah, and I'm not arguing either way, but that's what I've heard.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.300]   Jim, do you have a comment?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.020]   Yeah, I've taken a different approach.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:48.780]   I start off with the concept that stocks and equities will perform much better over time
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.980]   than bonds will.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:55.880]   If you look at history, that has largely been the case, and theoretically, bonds are in
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.060]   there to stabilize things.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:04.100]   However, it's clear, I think, if you do the math behind bonds, that if you're in a rising
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.980]   interest rate environment, which we did experience these last couple of years, then the value
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.420]   of the bonds will go down.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:20.260]   In a like manner, if you're in a declining interest rate environment, the value of bonds
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.940]   will go up just because of math, everything else being equal.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:31.900]   I personally have been very heavy in stocks, 80, 90%, but recently with the Fed talking
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:40.560]   about lowering interest rates, I've upped my bond percentage to about 20, 22%.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.460]   As far as bonds that pay 4%, somebody mentioned that earlier, well, that's hardly keeping
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.740]   up with inflation.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.500]   That's not doing you a whole lot of good as far as an investment is.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.340]   If you think about insurance, yeah, there's some insurance there.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.500]   I did an analysis.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.080]   This is before interest rates started rising.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:05.560]   If I was better off having money in cash that I would use if the stock market went kaboom
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:14.140]   versus bonds, and leaving more money in stocks and having a pot of cash, which I would call
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:22.140]   on if the market really tanked so I wasn't selling in a declining stock market, came
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.540]   out far better than bonds because it takes less cash to generate cash you can take out
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.700]   than it does in the value of a bond.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:38.140]   Bonds have their place, but I think that unless you're really interested in safety, tends
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:44.060]   to not be nearly as good as a much more aggressive equity portion.
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   Okay.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.180]   I just put this up.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.420]   I'm no expert at this.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.420]   Somebody showed me this the other day, and I'll put this in the chat.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:57.180]   What I did was I said, "I want to go from 1990 to 2024, but I could change that if somebody
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.380]   wants me to."
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.100]   I started with 10,000, and then I told it I wanted the U.S. stock market or the total
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.420]   U.S. bond market.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.460]   I could pick treasuries and different things.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:17.180]   I just took this total U.S. bonds, and in this portfolio, I have 100% in the U.S. stock
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.180]   market.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:23.740]   It doesn't really say what, S&P 500, whatever, and then this is that 100% in portfolio number
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:30.820]   two, so you guys can set this up yourself, and if I click Analyze Portfolio, and then
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.860]   this is I think the blue is the stock.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.580]   Yeah, there's the stock market.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:41.300]   That's from 1990, and you do have a very steady climb on the bonds, and then you have this
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:48.220]   little problem here, as Alan and Scott were talking about, but that's in the chat if you
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.380]   want to play around with that and change the times.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:58.780]   It also tells you your worst year in the stock market, so down 37%, and the worst in the
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:07.300]   bond market, and this was 13 and a quarter percent, so it's kind of interesting.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:14.340]   Okay, Jim, so Scott, how long of a period was this?
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.020]   Were you like a lot of stocks a long, long time ago, and you did this over a long period,
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.140]   or was this recently?
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:26.940]   And you're muted, Scott, if you could unmute.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.940]   Still muted.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.940]   There you go.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.780]   I have a few windows open, and so I'm there.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.940]   Yeah, I have a very short timeframe.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:46.460]   I've been looking at the bonds for roughly say the last year or so.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.380]   I'll give you a for instance.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.060]   I can change this date if you want.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.940]   Let me change this to the date range you're talking about.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.940]   What should I do then?
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.940]   20?
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:56.940]   Yeah, do 2020.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.940]   That's fine.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:03.340]   2020 to 2024, and then I've got the 100%, 100%, and I'll hit add those here.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.940]   Oh, I know exactly where you're at.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:05.940]   Okay, cool.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.300]   And then this gives me this, which you probably lived through, right?
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.620]   Yes, that's exactly what I'm dealing with.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:20.100]   So for instance, the S&P 500, the VOO, I'm getting 24% return in the last year, whereas
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:29.180]   my bond fund, I'm maybe getting 4%, 5% when I'm looking at it just in the last year.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.540]   And look at, I mean, here we're talking $10,000 to start, an initial dip.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.620]   This must have been the COVID downturn, right?
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.540]   Right when COVID started, I think?
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.540]   Okay.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.300]   And then now we're still below the line here.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.820]   We're at 9,600 versus this one.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.700]   But obviously, we could have a bigger correction than this, and we'd be wishing we had bonds,
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   right?
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.540]   That's exactly right.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:02.060]   And for me, being a newbie, as far as the retirement thing, I just retired.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.000]   I don't want to lose any money, period.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.980]   And I'm familiar with the stocks going up and down, I can handle that.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:14.260]   But I'm trying to equate whether just to keep that money in cash or to put it in bonds.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:20.220]   I don't want to look long-term, I don't want to have a five-year window for bonds.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:26.340]   I want to be able to have that money, that cash available to me tomorrow.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.020]   Yes, Alan?
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.900]   Yes, well, I think you need to look also, remember, a couple of points.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.660]   Number one, we want to look at our overall portfolio return.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.920]   Don't just focus on the equity returns and the angst that we're not getting that elsewhere.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.020]   We want to look at how the whole portfolio is performing for us and making sure we have
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.980]   enough to live on.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:54.460]   And we want to run out of life before we run out of money and be able to sleep well at
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.460]   night.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:01.980]   So we have to look at the two together and accept what the combination gives you.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.020]   And again, even looking at the bond market, it went down, it dipped down, it's slowly
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.020]   recovering.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.980]   So we'll be OK.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.080]   Those who stay the course and don't try to time the market and don't bail, just as when
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.320]   equities are falling, you don't want to bail and sell at the lows, you likewise don't want
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.340]   to do that with bonds, unless you are taking advantage of it as a tax loss harvesting opportunity,
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.140]   which is another thing we can delve into.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.180]   That's something I did in my taxable account.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.540]   As bonds fell, I had some municipal bond funds that took a beating also, and I sold them
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.540]   and tax loss harvested to get some benefit there.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.340]   So even when the market is volatile, certainly when bonds are volatile, there are some potential
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.660]   opportunities in a taxable account to benefit from that.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.780]   But the bottom line is we want to stay the course long term.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.140]   And if necessary, you can kind of build a liability matching bond portfolio that ties
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.840]   into the time when you need the money.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.780]   You may have a combination of short term, say, treasuries, and then some intermediate
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.100]   term treasuries.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:10.500]   Feds tend to advise against holding long term bonds because of their increased volatility,
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.420]   but some folks still do.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.020]   But if you kind of split up your bond fixed income holdings between intermediate term
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:23.900]   bonds, short term bonds, and then some cash as well, certainly with good yields now, that's
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.780]   reasonable, and you're further diversifying and just stay the course and rebalance.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.260]   That's what I tried to do.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.260]   Okay.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.420]   Thank you, Alan.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.740]   Mel, do you want to say something?
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.180]   Let's see if this...
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.180]   Can you hear me on this one?
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.180]   Yes, perfectly.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.180]   Okay, good.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.260]   My other computer, the speaker wasn't working.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:51.220]   When Scott said he simply doesn't want to lose any money in bonds, there are several
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.980]   ways he can do it or a combination of the two.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:19:00.780]   One is build a treasury ladder, buy an auction, and hold a maturity, and you will not lose
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.020]   any money.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:10.380]   You may lose spending power, and another way to cover that is to buy your allocation
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.380]   of I bonds.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:16.260]   So a combination of the short term at the present time, short term treasuries, bought
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:22.180]   an auction, held a maturity, and I bonds should cover him, and you won't lose a penny on either
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.180]   one.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.180]   Okay.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.180]   Okay.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.060]   If I could be so bold, I love what...
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.780]   I think her name is Christine Benz over there at Morningstar talks about in the different
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.940]   bucket strategies, and so I have a huge bucket of stocks.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.540]   I'm used to stocks.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.380]   I'm familiar with stocks.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.020]   I've been invested in stocks for 50 years.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.060]   I'm used to that.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.620]   The bond situation, I'm relatively new in the bond thing.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.860]   I've been doing the bond for roughly a year, two years, three years.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.740]   Bonds have been losing money like crazy lately.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.100]   I've been taking a bath in my bonds.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:09.180]   Then I have a whole bunch of money market or CDs or online savings accounts, and they're
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:18.500]   not losing any money on a monthly basis, and the interest I'm getting is 4% or 5%.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:25.140]   I'm having trouble sleeping at night knowing that my bonds are being affected so dramatically
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:31.620]   whereas I've been doing really well in the stock market for the last, say, 10 years I've
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.260]   been doing really well.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:40.500]   Now I'm taking a bath in the bonds, and with my limited experience in the bond market,
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.140]   losing money year after year, I'm really...
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.140]   I'm hesitant.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:52.380]   I'm having trouble sleeping at night knowing that I have 20% of my portfolio in bonds that
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:21:00.780]   I've been taking a bath, and you're telling me I just need to ride away, just stick with
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.780]   it.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.260]   I mean, if the Fed announced tomorrow that the interest rates were 1%, wouldn't you be
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.260]   just...
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.260]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.260]   You'd be whole like tomorrow morning, right?
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.260]   That's right.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.260]   You're absolutely right.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.260]   I don't think it's going to happen, but it would.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:21.180]   Scott, did you hear that you can buy treasuries at auction and hold a maturity and you will
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.020]   never lose a penny?
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.580]   You can also buy I bonds, which will give you inflation protection and you'll never
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.900]   lose any money.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:34.460]   So there's two solutions right there, and then you can sleep at night.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:40.500]   It's also good to hear, Scott, that it's 20%, not 80% either, right?
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   I missed that.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.500]   You said...
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.180]   I think you said it's 20% of the portfolio, right?
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.180]   Correct.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.180]   Correct.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.500]   20% of the portfolio is in bonds.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   Yes.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.220]   And from a diversification point of view, and as Alan was saying earlier, what age minus...
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.220]   What was your number, Alan?
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.980]   I think it's 100 minus age is one of the rules of thumb, I believe.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.540]   Now let me be brutally honest with you guys.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.100]   I've been 100% in stocks for 50 plus years.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.580]   I've ridden the wave.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:19.980]   I've been exposed to back when the market dropped 50% in 2008, I rode it out.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.980]   I didn't move.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.740]   I didn't lose a dime.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.980]   I stuck with it.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.940]   I'm used to things like the stock market going up and down.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.940]   You rode this.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.940]   This is what you rode.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.940]   You were the blue line.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.940]   I rode it.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.940]   I rode it.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.940]   But the red line's not so bad either.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.940]   I mean...
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.940]   You guys are killing me.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:45.180]   Jim, if you can show- There's people that live through the depression
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.620]   that wish they had some money in bonds probably, if they were solvent.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.620]   I don't know.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.740]   Jim, can you create a third portfolio there on Portfolio Visualizer, a 60/40 portfolio
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.420]   of equities and bonds to show you what that does?
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.420]   I think I can go 60 here.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.300]   Do you want 60 on the market and 40 on bonds?
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.340]   60 equities, 40 bonds, and then- Okay.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.140]   That should do it.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.180]   And then that gives us that.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.300]   And that's the orange line, I believe, right?
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   Right.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   Portfolio.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   I got it.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   I got it.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.300]   I got it.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   So, as somebody said in the comments, there's no free lunch.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.700]   And there's some other comments about cash.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:30.100]   Although it's paying great now, when interest rates drop, you're not going to get that.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.780]   People also commented that VOO is high return because it's high risk.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.820]   Is VOO this Vanguard thing?
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820]   Is it?
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.820]   This is VOO.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.380]   So, I like that curve too.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.380]   But look at this.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   You got some things like this.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.380]   Hey, I was there.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.380]   I felt it.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.380]   It was there.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.380]   You get to take the good with the bad, right?
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.060]   But, you know what, see, the thing is, I'm used to that with stocks.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.740]   I want that to happen with stocks.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.700]   I'm not going to lose any sleep.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.060]   But the bond market is something that's new to me that is killing me.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.060]   It's new to me.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.060]   I mean, I get the same feelings.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.060]   Let's see.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.020]   Jim, do you have another comment?
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.860]   And you're muted.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.420]   Okay.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.020]   Anything else, Scott, before we move on?
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.340]   I don't know if we can give you anything that would make you sleep better other than Mel's
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   advice.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.740]   I mean, the bucket strategy is cast in stone.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.740]   That's a good one.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:43.380]   Some of it in bonds, some of it in stocks, and some of it in cash.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.380]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.220]   In fact, if I do what Alan was talking about here, let me go right to here.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.980]   And you were saying 80-20, right?
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.980]   That's what I'm at right now.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.780]   Let's put this 80 and 20, okay?
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.620]   And then I'll hit this.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.660]   So now that's not so bad.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.820]   I mean, you could do a lot worse, I think, don't you think?
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.380]   I know it's not what you want, but it's not so bad.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.460]   I'm being retarded as a bitch.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.460]   Okay.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.900]   David, did you have a comment from Detroit?
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.660]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.780]   I think, I mean, this conversation is really focused on some extraordinary times we've
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.980]   had in the past couple of years in terms of specifically the bond market.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:37.700]   And I guess my thinking is that what's happened in the past few years is interesting to learn
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.340]   from, but we need to be looking forward and understanding what the nature is of the different
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.300]   things we want to be invested.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:50.140]   And I think, so I want to be forward-looking, first off, and second, I think maybe it sounds
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.180]   like some lessons have been learned here, right?
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.020]   So if something about your asset allocation is causing you to lose sleep, I think that's
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:02.260]   a red flag that says maybe your asset allocation doesn't suit your risk tolerance.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:07.100]   And so, yeah, so let's just understand what happened in the past and that we've gone through
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:13.380]   an extraordinary couple of years here and think strategically going forward.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.380]   Okay.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.580]   Thank you, David.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.140]   And Jean, do you have a comment?
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.500]   Yes.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.940]   Like Scott, I was heavily in stocks and as I've gotten into retirement, I moved to bonds.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:31.180]   And before I totally got into bonds, I started to study bonds and realized that not all bonds
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.180]   are equal.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:38.980]   And going back to Mel's message, Treasury bonds and I bonds are a whole lot different
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:45.620]   than municipal bonds and corporate bonds and junk bonds, and there's all kinds of bonds
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.620]   out there, Scott.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.740]   What are you invested in?
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.060]   Oh, you're muted, Scott.
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060]   Go ahead.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.060]   Unmute yourself.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.060]   I'm in T-Bills.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.340]   I mean, I'm as golden as I possibly can get.
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:08.860]   I'm not buying any I bonds, I'm not buying any junk bonds, I'm not buying anything other
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.860]   than Treasuries.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.860]   Short-term, long-term?
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.940]   I think I can pick Treasuries here.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:20.140]   Right now, I'm in, gosh, not long-term, medium-term and short-term.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.140]   Okay.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.420]   How about if I just call it intermediate-term Treasury here?
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.420]   There you go.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   Okay.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.460]   So, and that would be 20% here, 80%-
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.540]   Intermediate is anywhere from four to eight years or something?
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.380]   What is the duration of those?
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.380]   No.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:44.180]   The bond market I'm looking at is five years is the maximum, five years is the maximum.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:49.540]   Which one do you guys think I should pick here?
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.060]   That's short-term.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.060]   Five years maximum.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:58.980]   I think Mel, Mel, come on on, come back, come back to us, Mel.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:05.940]   Yeah, you're short-term, you start to hit at the five to six years, you start to hit
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.940]   the intermediate.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.940]   Right.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.820]   So, he's right at the cutoff point.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.820]   All right.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:11.820]   I'll pick short-term.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.820]   He's long on short-term.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.820]   I'm going to pick short-term.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.820]   Intermediate.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.820]   All right.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.620]   And are you, you're in strictly Treasuries and you're having, and you're having trouble
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.620]   sleeping at night?
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.620]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.620]   Ambient, ambient.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:30.180]   I'm looking at my S&P 500 and I'm getting 24% return, and I'm looking at my Schwab
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.700]   bond fund and I'm getting 4% return.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:42.140]   But there's your problem, Scott, don't buy a, don't buy a fund if you cannot afford to
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.940]   lose any money.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.940]   Correct.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.620]   Individual bonds, buy Treasuries and hold them to maturity.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.980]   You will never lose a penny.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.540]   Treasuries, yeah.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:29:02.780]   Bond funds have a high, high fees.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.980]   This orange line, Scott, I just want to make you sleep better at night.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:11.220]   This orange line, a lot of people who are paying high commissions, high fees, and are
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.500]   invested in the wrong stuff are not getting anywhere near this orange line.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.220]   So you should sleep better than you are.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.220]   Okay.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.100]   So to get the orange line, what do I got to do?
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.100]   That's what you're doing.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.100]   Treasury direct.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:31.820]   You're not blending the 20, you need to blend the 24% you're getting in your market, stock
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.580]   market stuff with your 4% you're getting in the bond.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.060]   That's what this is doing.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:42.660]   This is the stock down here, the bonds in the red and the stock market generally in
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.860]   the blue.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:49.420]   And because you're 80/20, you're 80% closer to that line.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.620]   And you have the diversification, which when the Fed lowers the interest rate to 1% tomorrow
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.140]   morning, you'll be completely opposite on this topic.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.700]   Well, you can see the volatility though.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.440]   What you're doing is adding volatility.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.380]   If you see that the yellow line more or less parallels the blue line, because they're primarily
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.780]   equities compared to the lack of volatility of the red line.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.900]   So it's a matter of risk, how much risk and volatility you're willing to accept to allow
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.540]   yourself to sleep well at night.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.540]   We're all individuals.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.180]   We have to decide that for ourselves.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.260]   So backing up big time, I am used to volatility.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.260]   I want to take advantage of the stock market.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.220]   I want to get that 24% return.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.740]   I want to get that 50% return.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:44.180]   I can handle, I'm keeping 20% of my portfolio, roughly five years worth of cash, living expenses.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.300]   I'm not working anymore.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:52.780]   I want to be able to have five years worth of income that I can just access tomorrow.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.380]   So what you're telling me, I'm not going to find that in the bond market.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.140]   I got to put that in CDs and mutual funds.
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:07.940]   If you put it in CDs, you don't have immediate access to it without paying penalties.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.460]   So you can, a penalty is a loss.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.460]   So if you-
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:18.380]   - Once again, you heard somebody else mentioned having a tree, having a CD tree, have something
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.860]   that's going to mature in five years, have something that's going to mature in four,
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.300]   three, two, one.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:31.220]   - Okay, so that I have access to, you know, 10,000 bucks a month that I can play with.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:36.700]   - So you can do that with CDs, or you can do it with treasuries.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.700]   Take your pick.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.380]   - Yeah, but once again, the treasuries, I'm not doing well.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.380]   You know, when I'm getting-
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.540]   - What do you tell, Scott, what do you tell somebody that went full into the market right
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:55.700]   here and dropped this much versus the guy who bought bonds on that same day who rode
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.180]   right through this blip?
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:04.580]   As I think David mentioned, we've got extraordinary circumstances going on in the last few years
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.580]   here.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.580]   - Okay.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.220]   - Do you have a Vanguard brokerage account?
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.220]   - Yes.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.520]   - Okay, you can buy treasuries with no problem, no cost, and you don't have to deal with treasury
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.700]   direct right from your brokerage account at Vanguard.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.380]   - Okay, do I have to do 10,000 bucks at a pop?
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:34.380]   - You can do 1,000, you can do 5,000, you can do 100,000, you can do 10 million.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.380]   - Okay.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.580]   Big picture time, guys.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.780]   Let me ask them, point blank.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:46.740]   That 20% that I would allocate towards bonds, what if I pull that 20% out and put it in
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:54.100]   mutual funds, put it in money market accounts, put it in CDs?
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:59.140]   - Well, the CDs aren't gonna be available to you without paying a penalty if you need
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.140]   it right away.
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.140]   You mentioned that.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.140]   - I do that tier thing.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:07.860]   Let's just reuse some round numbers, that 20% let's say is a million bucks.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:16.620]   Let's put $800,000 in four years, a CD that lasts four years.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:23.380]   Then let's put another $100,000 in a one-year CD, you follow me?
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:30.260]   And put the rest in a mutual fund that I can access next month without a penalty.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.340]   - Not without a loss though, which is what you wanna avoid.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.460]   - What kind of a loss am I gonna get in a money market?
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.220]   - You've already experienced it, Scott.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.220]   - How?
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.220]   Where?
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.860]   - The whole problem is you've already experienced it and you can't handle it.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:55.100]   So you gotta work around your inability to handle losses in bonds.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.540]   - If I can interject, Jim, I think we probably ought to move on, but one thing I wanna say
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.820]   is just as a little disclaimer to remind everybody that this meeting is for informational purposes
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.060]   only and should not be construed as personalized investment advice.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.100]   We can't delve into extreme detail for everybody.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.180]   We're just gonna talk in generalities and basics.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.580]   But if there's anybody else who has a little bit different perspective regarding bonds
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.940]   and how they handled the downturn last year, we'd like to hear from you.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.900]   Otherwise, I think we perhaps ought to move on.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.060]   - Okay.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.780]   Anybody else, raise your hand if you wanna speak about bonds.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.060]   Okay, well, we'll move on.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:37.300]   Thank you, Scott, for sharing that with us 'cause it was good discussion.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:44.260]   The next topic is pre-retirees, traditional or Roth retirement contributions.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.140]   Well, I think on the video they said not everyone had access in their early days if they're
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:53.100]   retiring now to Roth accounts.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.140]   And now they had a discussion about whether you should be contributing to a traditional
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.140]   or a Roth.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.740]   And I forget if it was Mike Piper or somebody said, they always base it on if you could
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:10.140]   predict your tax rate today versus when you retire, that should be part of your guidance.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.620]   Does anybody have experience with that?
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:17.220]   Maybe they've switched from traditional to Roth and they're not yet retired.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.220]   Anybody there?
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   David from Detroit.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:25.100]   - Yeah, actually, I've sort of gone through sort of my thought process on that as I look
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.620]   forward to retirement.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:32.340]   And so I'm in my sort of wanna expect the sort of peak earning years.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:36.700]   So one, you know, sort of, if you'd asked me 10 or 20 years ago, you know, where I would
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.860]   be at this point, I'd say, oh yeah, I definitely wanna be, you know, contributing pre-tax.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.380]   But then as I look forward and, you know, actually, so now that I have like line of
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:49.860]   sight to what cash flows might actually look like at, you know, a future retirement time,
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.740]   I realized that those, that RMDs, you know, wind up catching up with me in a couple of
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.980]   decades should I still be around.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.940]   And so that changes the math entirely.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:07.100]   But even though I'm at my peak, you know, salary earning years, that income for me is
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:13.540]   gonna wind up being, you know, substantially less than what my income might be in RMDs
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.100]   would likely be or my projected to be at that time.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.100]   So even though I'm at my peak earning years, I have completely shifted and put nothing
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:31.160]   into pre-tax savings anymore and I'm actually converting, you know, hundreds of thousand
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:37.040]   dollars over these next three years while the current tax cuts are in place.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.720]   So I've had to completely shift gears.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:45.460]   That's a purely personal situation, but I mentioned it because it's contrary to what
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:50.860]   sort of one might intuit if one looks at this from a couple of decades back, right?
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:57.460]   I'm at a place where one would expect to be really definitely abusing that tax deduction,
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:04.420]   but it turns out it's small potatoes compared to what I'd be facing at RMD time.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:10.260]   And somebody commented on one of the other calls that having high taxes at RMD time is
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.780]   a good problem to have, means you've got some money.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.980]   Probably the kind of problem we'd always to have.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.180]   And so Leslie, do you have a comment on that or you want to talk about your situation and
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.180]   you're muted.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.380]   Okay, Jean.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:40.500]   I've been, I've been taking RMDs for several years and now that I have the hindsight, I
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.180]   would have done it differently.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:48.740]   I would have taken my nest egg and divided it in half and had half in 401ks and the other
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:56.860]   half in after-tax monies because when the RMDs hit, they hit hard and you're just creating
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.340]   a huge tax bomb.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:04.540]   And that applies, and yes, it's a nice problem to have, and it applies to those people that
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.540]   were steady savers.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:12.100]   You know, they started their IRAs when they were 25 or 30 and they saved every year the
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.520]   maximum amount.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.060]   When you get there, you've built yourself a tax bomb.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.900]   Second thing is, is I believe this is a lower tax season than we'll see in a while.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.020]   So it's better off to pay the taxes now.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.020]   Okay.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.020]   It makes sense.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:32.540]   I think Alan, you talked about the RMD alternatives with charity or something last call.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.540]   You want to mention that again?
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:42.020]   Well, they're qualified charitable, what they call them, QCDs, Qualified Charitable
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.540]   Distributions, I think.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:51.220]   I haven't done those, but you can donate from your tax deferred account to a charity and
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.900]   that will count towards your RMDs.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.700]   Perhaps somebody who's doing that or Mel can provide details on that.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:02.340]   But one thing I'll add, it was Mike Piper, in fact, who commented primarily deciding
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:08.860]   between Roth versus traditional contributions while you're still working.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.460]   And as he pointed out rightly that a lot of us retirees never had Roth contributions as
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.220]   an option in our working days.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:21.860]   So now's a good time for us to be doing those Roth conversions and also to consider, as
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:27.780]   David did, to put more money into a Roth, especially if you were in a, expect that we'll
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:32.620]   have favorable tax status in the future.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.860]   But if you have a match in your IRA or 401k, I should say that is reasonable to at least
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.620]   contribute as much to get the match.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.580]   You don't want to turn away from free money and thereafter put more money into a Roth
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:49.140]   if it's appropriate tax wise.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:55.220]   The other group of people who need to be thinking about whether they're about consider putting
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.680]   money into Roth instead of a pre-tax are those with pensions.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:06.100]   And you mentioned sort of the previous generation that was more likely to have a pension and
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:11.500]   less likely to have access to Roth 401ks, for example.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:17.100]   But especially those in the middle who had both, for those who've had access to a lot
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.580]   of pre-tax contributions and also have a pension who may not be drawing down investments early
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:29.620]   on in their retirement, then those, when one is receiving maybe a couple of pensions, a
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:36.300]   couple of social securities, when one hits RMD age, a lot of those returns from investments
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:42.740]   can really wind up stacking on to create higher income levels and tax brackets than anticipated.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.100]   If I can interject one thing, it's helpful.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.100]   I believe it's Swab.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   I was looking for the URL.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.100]   I don't have it in hand.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.940]   But I think Swab has a free online calculator for RMD payouts, and you can plug in where
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:41:00.140]   your current tax-deferred account is and some other key information, and it'll project out
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.820]   what your RMDs will be in the future.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:06.740]   So you can kind of use that as a gauge as to whether you want to continue contributing
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:11.500]   the maximum there or perhaps shift dollars towards Roth or otherwise.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.320]   And that's a useful modeling tool.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.380]   You do have to make some assumptions on what the return will be.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:24.420]   But if you're typically primarily fixed income, as many of us are, we're predominantly fixed
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.740]   income, you can kind of model it pretty well what the future return will be and then see
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.460]   what your RMDs will look like years later.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.980]   Yeah, Alan, Keith, go ahead here.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:41.020]   I was just noticing in the chat, there's a couple of comments right after Keith.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.380]   I'll make some comments that might get some discussion going that's in the chat right
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.380]   now.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.380]   Go ahead, Keith.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:53.140]   So I'm kind of in the situation that David from Detroit was describing, have a pension
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.700]   and I'm a few years away from collecting Social Security.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.780]   I want to get to at least full retirement, if not a little bit later.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.140]   And what scares me is having to take RMDs.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:10.980]   So as I mentioned, I think when I talked earlier, I'm going through and doing Roth conversions.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:17.180]   I didn't have the opportunity to have a Roth 401(k) that I could contribute to until the
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.580]   last month of my 30-year career.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.780]   And so it was way past.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:27.580]   I had advocated for it for about 10 years and the company never did it until I literally
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:32.260]   had one month to go till I retired and I wish I had that option.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.420]   And I look at it from two perspectives.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:42.340]   Number one is just having the ability to put that in tax after tax.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:47.460]   But to me, it's really the flexibility because you don't know what kind of situation you're
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:53.020]   going to be in later on when RMDs happen.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:59.340]   Between my pension, Social Security, my wife will get a spousal benefit.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:05.020]   And then having to do RMDs, I think it was Jean that mentioned, it can hit you pretty
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.300]   hard.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:12.180]   And so I'm kind of taking the pain right now and doing Roth conversions and paying the
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.660]   tax on it, but I wish I had the opportunity to do it while I was working.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:26.660]   So I have two working adult kids with 401(k) plans and I tell them, do Roth if you can
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:33.260]   and make sure you're contributing to your Roth IRA so that later on, no matter what
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:40.500]   fiscal policy there is and tax rates there are, you'll have the flexibility, more flexibility
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.180]   than someone like myself that has to do Roth conversion.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:51.940]   So I like that and the fact that I'm doing something that I know right now what the tax
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:58.980]   rates are so I can plan with a known, known, so to speak, as opposed to not knowing what's
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.020]   going to be like when it comes to Roth conversions.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:07.900]   I just prefer to make decisions based on things that are factual rather than guessing what
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.820]   it's going to look like in the future.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.860]   I think the diversification aspect there is really important.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:19.580]   And I think he and I, this is David, we've both learned a lesson that having some more
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.140]   money toward the Roth side might've been helpful in retrospect.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.860]   But don't forget, depending, there's lots of people online here, people are earlier
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:32.700]   in their career, especially, that what you certainly don't want to do is be in a situation
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.980]   where you're pulling out funds out of your Roth, out of a Roth account in retirement
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.780]   for your first dollar, right?
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:48.220]   Because those for married filing jointly today, your first $27,700 are tax-free.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.300]   And then for some portion after that, you're only paying 10%, which is almost certainly
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.860]   less than you're paying today.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.900]   And so you want to plan on having money in both accounts.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.740]   Gene has said 50/50, Keith has said he wishes more on the other side, but I think tax diversification
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.780]   was also mentioned in the round table.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:12.060]   And I think that's sort of what we're talking about is it's not all or nothing, but I think
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:16.980]   at some point you need to start projecting future cash flows and that's where everybody
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.980]   alluded to.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.500]   You need to have plans and you really need future cash flows.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:26.860]   I found that new retirement was the calculator that put me on the path of understanding where
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:33.580]   I might be and help me sort of understand what the right mix might be for my situation.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:43.940]   If I can just add really quick before you go to Marion, I think the tax comment that
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.660]   David made is very important.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:53.260]   For those of you that are five or 10 years away from retirement, I personally used TurboTax
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.700]   for a long time.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.620]   So I saw the hard numbers that I was entering and thinking about.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.860]   I have two friends that are near retirement and they both have somebody else do their
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.260]   taxes for them.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:09.760]   So they don't really think about tax consequences and moves they might want to make.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.500]   And now that they're thinking about retirement and they're asking me my advice, one of the
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:20.740]   things I say is get familiar with how things are taxed because there are smart ways and
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:27.100]   not so smart ways to spend in retirement, certain money that you want to spend, others
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.740]   that you don't, depending on whether it's a taxable account or not, and just understand
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:38.060]   how things are taxed and where money is coming from and how it affects your individual tax
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.060]   situation.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:46.900]   And that can be thousands of dollars a year difference in an available income, depending
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.380]   on how you handle certain things.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:54.220]   So for those of you that are five or 10 or 15 years away, and you're just maybe starting
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:47:01.060]   to think about it, my advice is to at least get familiar with taxes and how they work
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:07.420]   and how it's going to affect you so that you start making the right decisions now and don't
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:12.940]   put yourself in a situation where in retirement, all of a sudden you're paying more taxes than
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:18.660]   you thought you were or needed to because it affects it more than I think people realize
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.340]   when they're working and they're busy with their work lives.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.340]   Okay.
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.340]   Thank you, Keith.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.340]   Miriam.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.700]   I agree with what Keith just said.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.900]   I agree with that.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:34.740]   One thing on the forum, many will say that it's good to go into retirement with equal
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:45.220]   amounts in your taxable account, your 401k, your pre-tax account, and your post-tax account,
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:46.580]   your Roth account.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:52.740]   Have equal amount in each more or less because as David mentioned, when you get into retirement,
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:58.460]   each account has different, there are different things you can do with each account, pre-tax
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.780]   money, post-tax money, and your taxable account.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:06.340]   It gives you flexibility and especially for our kids.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:11.380]   For our kids now, they can put a lot of money into those Roth accounts.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:18.940]   They can pack it into those Roth accounts, but not to neglect the pre-tax accounts.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:29.700]   For example, my kids, they can have their 401k be pre-tax and then they can max out
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.860]   their Roth IRA, which is now $7,000 a year.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.740]   That's a pretty good chunk into your post-tax.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:44.340]   By the time they reach retirement, they will have a big chunk in the Roth IRA already,
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:52.340]   which we did not have because there were no Roths when we were accumulating money.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.340]   It's good for them.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:49:00.340]   Also, for the kids, when they put it into the 401k, remember that money is not taxed,
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.940]   so their income tax is lower.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:09.940]   They have a lower income tax because the 401k is not taxed, therefore, they have a little
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.120]   extra money.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.680]   They can then put that over into their Roth IRA.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   That's how that can work.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.000]   Yeah, kind of like investing the tax savings, you're saying.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.800]   Anyway, for me, it was interesting.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   I kept investing in my regular traditional IRA before there were Roths.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:37.760]   By the time Roths were born, I had this huge, well, a large traditional IRA.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.120]   I just kept investing even though I could not deduct it.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.760]   What was nice is that by the time I converted, really only about 50% of my conversion was
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:56.440]   taxable because the rest had already been taxed when I put it into the traditional IRA.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:03.720]   Even if you're in the position I was in, hope is not lost, you can still do a nice conversion
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:09.520]   into your Roth IRA and not pay a giant amount of taxes now, a huge amount of taxes now.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.160]   Okay, thank you.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.600]   We have a caller, or not a caller, but we have a person named 14056, if you'd like to
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   go ahead.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.740]   Yeah, this is Pat.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:24.200]   Right now, they're telling a lot of young people just to go into Roths right away.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:30.000]   I'm talking about people graduating from college because they said your income for many jobs
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.840]   is never going to be lower than it is right now.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.340]   Just keep doing that.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:41.040]   Right now, I think my company now will also match Roth 401ks.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:48.200]   Right now, I'm about 50% pre-tax, 50% post-tax.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:55.400]   My issue right now is I really need to not take Social Security until full retirement
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   age.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.760]   I want to work indefinitely.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:06.220]   I work on call as an editor, and I'm part-time on call, and I'm really, really enjoying it,
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:13.260]   but there seems to be no good time for me to do any kind of conversions or whatever.
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:18.460]   I'm starting Medicare in July, and I don't really want to do anything that's going to
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.460]   ... What is it?
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.460]   The Irma?
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:21.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.460]   Yes.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.420]   It's like somebody can't say, "Oh, wait until you retire," because I'm happier when I'm
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.420]   working.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:33.860]   I'm single, and I have friends and everything else, but just somehow making money, even
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:40.220]   if it's a small project, it gives my life structure, so I'm just really kind of struggling.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:45.380]   Somebody was talking to me about ... Apparently, I'm pretty well set.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:52.340]   I was told that they did a Monte Carlo, and I should be able to live the rest of my life
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.520]   with no problem.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.140]   I can't bring myself to spend my money.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:03.180]   For 32 years, or actually closer to 35, I've been investing and reinvesting dividends and
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:08.340]   capital gains, and it got me to where I am now, and now I have a cash flow problem because
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.780]   I'm really heavily invested.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.140]   I could take money out, but I hate doing it, so I'm just kind of stuck.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:19.060]   I have to figure out what to do, but I can't spend my own money.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:24.120]   That's a common problem that they talked about that on the ... What did you say, Alan, last
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.120]   time?
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.160]   Either you fly first class, or your heirs are going to fly first class, right?
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.160]   You said that.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.160]   I love that one.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.160]   Right.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.160]   I'll throw in something.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.800]   I'm just putting this in the chat, but just to reiterate, for those of you who can, having
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:42.200]   the majority of your bonds in the tax-deferred account may be beneficial, because the slower
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:48.000]   growth of the bonds will help moderate your future RMDs, because if you have more of your
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   equity holdings in a taxable brokerage with favorable long-term capital gains tax rates
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.080]   or a Roth with no taxes, have your main growth occurring there, and slow down your tax-deferred
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.560]   growth by having most of your bonds, if not all of them, in that account.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:11.160]   That's another way to control future RMDs long-term.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.480]   And Leslie, did you have a comment?
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   Your hand's up.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   I do.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.440]   Sorry, I had issues with my microphone.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:24.400]   One thing that I've learned over the last couple years is my company allows us to max
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:33.480]   out the IRS pre-tax savings, so $23,500 plus the catch-up, and they'll match that.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:41.040]   And once we hit that IRS limit, they allow us to put money in post-tax dollars up to
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:47.320]   the IRS limit, which is now close to $76,500.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:53.960]   That money can be immediately rolled over into our 401(k) Roth.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:00.440]   So it's a mega backdoor Roth concept, but that's the way where I'm putting a large amount
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:06.360]   of money into the Roth to kind of spearhead what everybody's been talking about, trying
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.680]   to be able to maximize our taxes when we retire.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.000]   But so anybody who works for a big corporation, you know, double-check.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.680]   I would say I've actually done some education for our employees, and I would say 90% of
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:28.120]   them did not even know that this benefit, and I considered a benefit, existed.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:34.720]   So for super savers, it's a way to get the pre-tax savings as well as get money into
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   the Roth environment.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.720]   Okay.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:44.440]   I'm just going to ask Margo, if you wanted to get on, you know, at least speak to it.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.960]   You mentioned in the comment about psychologically on a hard time having, having a hard time
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.080]   spending money that you've so diligently saved.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:57.640]   Could you maybe express your comment audio-wise?
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.640]   You mean me?
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.640]   1-4-0-5-6?
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:04.180]   Well, it came up in Margo on the chat.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:13.600]   I was addressing it to you, to 1-4-0-5-0-6, but I just personally, I'm like known as El
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.000]   Chifador among my family, and I just have a really, really hard time spending money.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.400]   It's so hard for me.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.000]   And I like, you know, comparison shop for everything, and it just, it got to a point
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.080]   where I had to realize, like, this is not productive.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:31.600]   This is not a good use of my headspace, a good use of my, like, limited time on earth.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.400]   It's just not what it's meant to be used for.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.400]   And I read, I can't remember where I read it, but it said, I can't remember now where
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:45.280]   I saw this, but it said, if you have a hard time enjoying or employing money productively,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:50.440]   a great way to begin to get over it is to, you know, find a cause that you're passionate
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.840]   about and donate whatever amount is like a little bit painful.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.840]   Psychologically, like, that's a good idea.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:06.120]   Right now, I'm, I'm turning 65, I don't even know what's going to happen to me.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.880]   I don't have long term care insurance, I probably can't get it.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:17.240]   I instead of trying to sell stuff, I do donate like to a lot of animal shelters have a thrift
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.240]   shop.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.560]   And I like getting rid of this, it's really easy to get rid of this stuff, knowing it's
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.240]   going for the animals.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:29.400]   But, but right now, I still have an issue that I don't know that, you know, they say
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.320]   I'll be okay.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:38.640]   But if I end up in long term care, either dementia, God forbid, you know, it's not going
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:43.940]   to be easy, because by the time I'm old enough, you know, we could be paying a heck of a lot
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:44.940]   of money.
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:50.360]   So I really can't, you know, right now, I have to really keep a tight rein on my own
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.560]   money right now.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.400]   I understand.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:58.520]   One more comment from the, from the chat, I was wondering if Matthew Heaney could speak
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:05.160]   to some of the issues about not wasting space in the lower brackets and smoothing out the
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.160]   marginal rates.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.400]   I think you made comments about that.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.200]   I've seen a few comments in the chat.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:17.640]   Are you still here, Matthew?
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.500]   Okay.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.480]   So I think, actually, Alan, you've already touched on this tax efficiency of drawdown
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.880]   strategy, right?
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.680]   Which is this topic here.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:39.240]   Not, not per se, I guess I'd like to hear other folks' thoughts, other than, as Maria
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:45.960]   alluded to, having tax diversification is key and having, you know, three buckets, relatively
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:51.240]   well balanced, it gives you options, depending upon what the future tax situation is that
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   you find yourself in.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:59.360]   Historically, I know they say that draw from your, your taxable brokerage first, and then
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:05.000]   you go to the IRA or tax deferred, and then leaving the Roth for last.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.240]   But there's times, as I think Wade Fowl alluded to during that round table discussion, that
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:14.520]   there are times that you may want to switch that up a bit.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:19.280]   It has to be, you know, it's an individual situation and you have to decide what's best
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.660]   for you and your tax situation.
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:28.580]   I'm not a tax expert by any means, so I'm curious to hear other folks' opinions.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:36.320]   Would anyone like to speak about tax efficiency drawdown strategies and what you're using?
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.980]   Okay.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:45.360]   So I guess the next topic was pay off the home mortgage before retirement.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:52.200]   Anybody chose that or chose to go the other way, mortgage to the hilt?
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:56.660]   Okay.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:06.000]   You know, I'll just say, Jim, I'm a big believer in having, you know, known things that to
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   deal with.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.920]   So to me, and, you know, we paid off ours, we don't, I didn't want to have a mortgage
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.160]   in retirement because what if something else happened that it needed to be piled on top
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.400]   of that?
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.580]   You know, I have adult kids and, you know, help them a little bit to get on their feet
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:30.100]   that maybe I didn't think about 10 years ago.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.640]   You know, as you get older, obviously you start to have more health issues, whether
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.820]   it's just co-pays or whatever.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:43.720]   And so for me, less debt, the less debt, the better is what I aimed for.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:50.600]   So when those unexpected expenses came up or just maybe wanting to travel and the difference
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:56.480]   between being able to travel and not, it would be a mortgage payment that I'm a big believer
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:05.040]   in and having as little debt as possible when you go into retirement.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.160]   And you sleep better, right?
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.280]   Absolutely.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.800]   And Jean, would you like to make a comment about that?
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.320]   Yeah, before I retired, I paid good money three different times to go out.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.680]   And I always ask that question, the financial advisor, should I pay off my house?
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.680]   Should I pay off my house?
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.680]   And I constantly got the advice of no.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.240]   Now of course, I'm in retirement and I see it would be very handy to have it all paid
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.240]   off.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:37.000]   It would require less monthly output of cash every single month.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.240]   So I am now an advocate for pay it off.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:46.160]   The only con to that would be, let's say you had one of those really bare bones mortgage
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.840]   rates of two, I don't know what the lowest it ever hit recently, but like say two and
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.860]   three quarters or something.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:59.720]   And as Scott was talking about interest rates and CDs, there would be a big marginal difference.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.740]   And I think that's partially what's going on in the housing market.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.600]   People with those mortgages say, if I sell this house today and buy this other house,
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.820]   I'm going to trade it two and a half for a seven.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.880]   So there's that going on.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.560]   I have a 3% mortgage, so I am one of those people.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.520]   And I still see the advantage to having it paid off.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.920]   Oh yeah, I agree.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.920]   I agree with you.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.000]   I'm in your camp, but this is, I'm just saying what other people might say.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.720]   Jo, do you have a comment on this?
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:35.560]   I think that's the wrong way to think about it is compared to the open market rate, because
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.680]   that's always going to fluctuate.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:44.520]   This really fixes your cost in retirement and it's your number one expense, well, it's
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.520]   actually number two.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.840]   Taxes is your number one spend and your house payment is number two.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:58.680]   So it controls number two, and I'm all for controlling the top five spends that you have.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.080]   And the sleep at night factor is nice.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.680]   I totally agree with you on that one.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.800]   So I think the professionals just don't really have a clue yet because they haven't retired.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   Hey, Jo.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800]   Yes.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:22.280]   One thing we did, we noticed a fair time before I was ready to retire that just adding a little
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:30.040]   bit of extra principal to the mortgage greatly reduced the duration.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:38.280]   And that was a very good feeling of being able to just make some extra payments on it
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.360]   that greatly reduced it.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:47.120]   Then about the time I was retired, we did pay it off and I slept much better.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:53.920]   I just felt very good then that it was totally paid off and that was out of the way.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:01.080]   And most people will find in retirement sometimes the property tax goes up.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:09.300]   So even though you don't have the mortgage payment, you do have non-insignificant property
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.300]   tax payments.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:15.760]   And insurance, if you're in an area where insurers are getting out, like some areas
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.880]   of Florida, I think you could have a lot more homeowners insurance than you had before.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:27.440]   All the insurances are going up, but even in areas, we're in Alabama, which is not a
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:36.840]   particularly other than tornadoes, but anyway, but still, we see that going steady climb.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840]   Thank you.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840]   You're welcome.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:45.760]   I noticed in the chat from Margo, Kim, and Carolyn, the opposite about the good rate
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.760]   mortgages that they have and the fact that they can pay them off whenever they want.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:04:00.300]   Does any one of you guys want to comment on that?
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.300]   This is Carolyn.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.300]   Go ahead, Carolyn.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:10.520]   I would just say nobody's giving me money at 2.875%, so I'm going to keep my mortgage
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.000]   and just pay it off as usual.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:22.840]   If I needed to pay it off, I could, but I sleep fine at night with the mortgage.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.840]   Good.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840]   Okay.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   Anyone else?
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840]   This is Kim.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840]   Yes, Kim.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:35.040]   I think my comment was really related to how "money managers" being paid, and they generally
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.320]   don't want you to take money out to pay off the mortgage because it reduces their income
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.120]   for charging you based on assets under management.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.320]   They would never do that, would they?
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.440]   Maybe.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.440]   That's a very good point.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.440]   Yes.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:57.640]   I'm going to take a controversial idea right now, and I have a proponent of Dave Ramsey,
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:03.720]   and he talks about paying that thing off to sleep better at night.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.200]   It's a hard sell when you're paying 2.75%.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:14.720]   I just wanted to ask Leslie, who has her hand up, if you really have your hand up and would
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.040]   like to say something, or is that just stuck on right now?
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.600]   Okay.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   Let's move on to Joe.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   Joe, you have a comment?
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   No.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.000]   I hadn't taken my hand down.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   Okay.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.960]   There's a DC, username DC.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   Go ahead.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   Can you hear me okay?
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   Yes.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:36.960]   Okay.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.960]   Go ahead, Joe.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.560]   I'm in the process of paying down our mortgage, and I'll explain my reasoning on that.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.520]   We have 2.99% mortgage.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:53.240]   It's a decent amount of money on there, say about $70,000, but we're going to pay that
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.480]   down before we retire, even with the lower rate.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:05.280]   Our reasoning is based on our ages when we retire, so I'll be going on ACA or Obamacare
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.200]   for about 4 years.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.180]   My wife's going to be on Medicare, but she's also going to collect her Social Security
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.180]   at FRA.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.720]   She's older than me.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.360]   So our reasoning is let's pay it down because I want to keep my income low when we first
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.920]   retire so I can qualify for ACA subsidies.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   Okay.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:27.280]   We want to keep our Social Security taxes low, so I want to keep my income low, so I don't
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   want to be paying a mortgage once I'm actually retired, so that's our thought process.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.560]   That's an excellent idea.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.200]   So if you were to take -- if you had to pay all that out of 401(k) or something, draw
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:44.880]   down, that would be income, and that would affect your ACA subsidy, which could be substantial,
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880]   right?
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   Right.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   Okay.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   Very good comment.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880]   Sonny?
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:58.160]   I was going to say, yeah, I'm in the process of retiring, and I have a 2.5% rate and a
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:03.840]   decent-sized mortgage, but my cash portion and my short-term bond portion, there's more
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.920]   than enough there to pay that down.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.800]   So I don't really have an issue sleeping at night, but I can pay it off whenever I feel
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   like it.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.760]   Let's say two or three years down the road, rates go back down and end up back at -- you're
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:20.280]   looking at 1% or something in terms of savings rate, you can just pay it off at that point
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.840]   where I'm making 5% now in savings or a CD.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.840]   Okay.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.840]   So that's my view.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.840]   Very good.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.840]   Let's see.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:34.800]   Our next topic was funding ratio tool for retirement readiness.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.840]   I don't remember what they said about that.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.760]   Anybody remember what that topic was about?
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:46.280]   I say, Jim, if I can interject, there's a good comment from Maggie Wood about this.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:52.740]   Is anyone considering selling their house and downsizing and/or renting in retirement
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:57.360]   and also throw in the concept of geographic arbitrage, moving from a higher cost of living
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.840]   area to a lower cost of living area during retirement?
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.720]   If anybody would like to address those options.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:11.320]   Carolyn, go ahead.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:18.680]   Yes, I've thought about that, and I'm kind of looking at it two ways.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.760]   So my younger retirement years, I'm going to stay where I am.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:31.840]   I purposely bought a ranch and remodeled it and plan to kind of stay here for that first
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:37.500]   15, 20 years when I'm more active as a retiree.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:44.860]   And then I will probably downsize from there and go somewhere where more kind of independent
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:50.560]   living situation for seniors because I'm single and I don't have kids.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.440]   So I think at that point, you know, I'll be ready to kind of slow down and it'll probably
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:01.480]   be someplace like Vegas or somewhere warm and low taxes.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.360]   And what area of the country are you from now?
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360]   I'm in Michigan.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360]   I'm in the Detroit area.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360]   Okay.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.440]   All right.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.440]   Thank you.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   Sam?
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:18.480]   I don't, my, our house here in retirement is only 900 square feet, so there's no way
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:26.560]   down to downsize unless we move to a tiny home, which with our aching osteoarthritis,
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:32.320]   we can't even climb up the stairs nowadays.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:41.320]   My neighbor next door, he's a millennial, just starting with the first home buyer program.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.520]   He says that, yeah, we will, we need to live in a bigger house.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.400]   I'm going to move.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:54.720]   If we end up later in retirement, we still live in this house, which is the same size
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.400]   as my house, 900 square feet.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.440]   That is a failure for us.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.840]   He said, "Uh-oh, here we are."
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.080]   It's paid for, 900 square feet, but it's paid for.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.800]   And you sleep well at night?
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.800]   Certainly.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.120]   There you go.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.120]   That's all that matters.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:23.140]   I want to thank that person who says that he is, his strategy is to pay off the house
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:30.940]   so that the, for Obamacare purposes, great idea.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   I didn't think about it.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940]   Very good idea.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940]   Yes.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:34.940]   Yes.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.940]   That is, that is good.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.120]   That is a good one.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   One idea we heard on a previous call a long time ago on a Obamacare discussion about subsidies
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:51.300]   was somebody actually took out a home equity because they needed cash for daily living,
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:57.680]   and it ended up, it was better than taking money out of their 401(k) to ride through
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.700]   from like 62 to 65.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.760]   So that was an interesting strategy.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:14.660]   Okay, I think we can move on to the next topic.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.080]   Back to the funded ratio concept.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.640]   I don't even know what, I'm sorry, but I don't know what that is.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.440]   If anybody can help me with that.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:31.480]   It's the same analysis that pensions use to see basically how well capitalized they are
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:38.720]   for future obligations, and I think, I don't, I think it might have been Wade Fow who said
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:44.740]   that, it might have been Mike Piper who has a calculator online or a spreadsheet where
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:51.960]   you can plug in your data and see what your funded ratio is.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.720]   I'm not that familiar with it.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.400]   Maybe somebody with expertise could speak to that.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.400]   Anyone?
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.720]   I'll see if I can look it up.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.760]   Oh, if not, let's, let's move on to the next topic.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.800]   Let me get my cheat sheet here.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.220]   Retirement contribution when one spouse is still working.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:21.560]   So this, I guess the assumption here is one spouse retired, the second one is still working.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:27.280]   And I think it belongs to, I'm not sure if Carolyn said it or Sam said it about the
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:36.360]   Obamacare subsidies could be significant if you're, you know, in that pre-retirement age.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.000]   Does anybody have any comments about making retirement contributions with one person retired
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.120]   and one working in a two-person family?
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120]   Jeanne?
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:55.720]   As I recall, they summarized that one with the only advantage was if there was an age
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:02.640]   difference between the couple, one was putting it into a 401k and the other was drawing it
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.000]   out of their IRA.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.520]   And if there was a significant age difference between the couple, it could be an advantage.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520]   Otherwise it was a wash.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.920]   It kind of sounds like putting in one pocket and taking it out of the other.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.600]   That's what I recall the conversation ended up with, because I was really listening to
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.400]   that one for some friends of mine.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.400]   Okay.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.480]   Let's see how we're doing on, it's 825.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:39.240]   The next topic, spend more now and also work longer.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.280]   Maybe we could take a show of hands of people who are actually retired right now.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.040]   Just hit that show, raise hand if you could.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.600]   And I think we have 64 people on the call.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:14:07.520]   And I'm seeing about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.960]   Okay.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   So about 18.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960]   So maybe a third.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.960]   Okay.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:17.040]   If you could lower your hand and let's say you're going to retire in the next five years,
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:33.040]   raise your hand like we have about 10, 11, 12.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.440]   Okay.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:41.960]   And the people that are between 18 and 24, I don't think we have many, but we're open
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.960]   for everybody.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.640]   And, you know, if anybody wants to get advice as a younger person, feel free to ask.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.120]   We have a lot of experience here.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.640]   And who on this, who on this call has had a lot of trouble spending money now that they
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.720]   are retired and are not accumulating, anybody?
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.880]   You can just raise your hand if you want.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.800]   Mary, would you like to speak on that?
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.040]   Or Joe?
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.040]   Or Keith?
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:26.120]   We, I mean, we have to withdraw more RMD than we have any need to spend.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:35.600]   Plus we have social security and we just, we're satisfied with the way we live, which
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.360]   doesn't really cost that much.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.400]   We have our house paid off, don't owe anything on cars.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.920]   We don't have an extravagant, we do eat out, but we don't eat out extravagantly and it
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.320]   really doesn't take that much money.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:55.480]   We're in a fairly low, we're in Alabama, which is fairly low cost of living area.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.720]   Taxes are fairly low.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:08.120]   And so, you know, we have much more than we need, but we have, don't, you know, kind of
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:14.240]   that thing of we've saved and, you know, I still look for bargains, I still use coupons.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:20.080]   I still, you know, look, you know, you can't get over that.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.320]   You've been trained for 50 years, right?
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.320]   Or 70 years.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   Right.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:35.760]   And, you know, it, you, but, you know, I say I'm frugal and I have a friend who's cheap.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.240]   So he's worse than I am.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.220]   I think that's my favorite thread on the, on the site is that what frugal thing did
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.220]   you do today?
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:49.000]   You know, where the guy's gotten 50 days out of the same teabag, you know, that stuff just
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.940]   getting so excited, you know.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:17:00.560]   Well, this, my friend, the one I call cheap, one of the local pizza places had that if
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:07.280]   you paid a certain amount, you could have a slice of pizza every day for a month and
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:15.200]   he bought it and then, then would just drink water, wouldn't even buy a drink when he went
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.200]   in.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.720]   And did he get pizza almost every day?
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.720]   Yes.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.720]   Yes.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.720]   For a month.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:22.720]   Great.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   That's great.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.720]   Okay.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   Thank you.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   Mel.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:35.300]   Yeah, a number of years ago when I was doing Forbes column, my editor got in touch with
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:42.560]   me and asked me about, she was getting ready to retire and she was really concerned about
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:49.200]   going from having a salary to not having a salary and not having money coming in and
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.800]   happened to start to spend down.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.960]   And I told her that I had a problem with that.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.880]   And I thought it would be a good subject for an article.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:09.960]   So I interviewed a lot of the Bogleheads and I was not really surprised, but I found out
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:16.960]   that there were a lot of people who had a serious problem transitioning from saving
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.480]   to spending.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:25.480]   So I did a column on that and it's still available on Forbes, it's called Shifting Gears, Going
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.880]   from Saving to Spending.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:36.680]   And it is basically a real problem that a lot of Bogleheads said they had.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.600]   And I knew that I had the same problem.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.800]   So yeah, there's the article.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.800]   It's still up.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.200]   It was 10 or 15 years ago.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:52.720]   But you might look through that and see that if you do have a problem that you're not alone.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.960]   I was really amazed to find out that I wasn't the only one.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.720]   Yes, it's a common theme.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.320]   Somebody said on the last call, I think they, you know, you basically get, you know, make
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.480]   yourself a paycheck and whether you give it to charity, as somebody suggested, or you
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.760]   buy something you want or help somebody out, just you got to spend it.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:16.760]   Keith?
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.720]   Yeah, I'll second what Mel said.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.280]   It was extremely difficult.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:26.400]   You know, you're used to looking in your checking account and seeing that direct deposit from
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.040]   your paycheck every couple of weeks.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.200]   So you feel okay with buying some things here and there, and then all of a sudden you don't
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:39.240]   have that, even if it's investment income or a retirement.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.400]   And I'll just throw out there that some people making comments about frugal.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:47.840]   I came across, for those of you that are on Facebook, there's something called, there's
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.960]   a group called Everything Frugal on Facebook.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   And I joined it maybe a month ago.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.680]   And it's kind of interesting.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:02.640]   It's a lot of the same kind of talk that we have here, but it's more related to spending,
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:08.380]   being better for spending decisions, finding ways to save money, not necessarily on the
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:15.720]   investing side, but more on, hey, I'm doing this and how can I save an extra $50 here
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.720]   and there.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.240]   So for those of you that like to call yourselves frugal or cheap and are on Facebook, it's
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.800]   called Everything Frugal, and it's kind of interesting.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.620]   And there's a lot of people make comments and they'll give their advice, maybe something
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:30.620]   they did.
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:37.600]   And I've picked up an idea here a couple of times on utilities and services and things
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   like that.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   So it's kind of interesting.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.600]   - Okay.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.880]   I put a link in the chat for anybody that needs it.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.880]   Sam?
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:53.280]   - Hi, Keith, I disagree for going to Everything Frugal for us who are already frugal because
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.920]   it will, the opposite of the antidote to being frugal.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:07.240]   In the Boglehead conference, Mike Piper say the antidote is to get counseling.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:13.480]   Ouch, pay a psychologist, it's not that much, Mike Piper says, to get counseling.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:26.800]   And he even does it because if you worry about not having enough money or what, anyway, Joe,
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:38.480]   I agree with Joe that to give yours, no, for Jim, I agree with Jim, give yourself a paycheck.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:49.880]   So that, yeah, otherwise, I mean, you think about like our safe withdrawal rate is, we
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:55.840]   already set it for 3% and then it ends up being a lot less than that.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:56.840]   Could you believe it?
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.200]   We can't even reach 3%.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.840]   - And if the market does well for a while, it's going the opposite way, right?
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.840]   - Yeah.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.840]   - If we only knew how long we were going to live, it would be very simple.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.960]   - I think there's a website for that, it'll tell you exactly.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:27.120]   And then last comment about to Joe, I say that the cost of living for his lifestyle
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.120]   is satisfied.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:37.360]   And the only thing that he spends is eating out, well, I don't even eat out, Joe.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:45.440]   I cook all the food myself, thanks to YouTube, literally.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.960]   And with COVID, we really cut that back and we spare no expense on groceries, that's for
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.040]   sure.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.680]   But we really enjoy cooking now.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:58.560]   Okay, Alan, thank you, Sam.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.800]   - Yeah, these are all great comments.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:07.200]   I too have suffered with this, being a longtime individual living, my wife and I both living
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.880]   well below our means, and it's very hard to break that habit in retirement.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.960]   But one thing that I have found useful in initiating a step in the right direction is
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:22.040]   focusing more on creating memories with our friends and families, say, trying to take
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.360]   vacations and paying for the kids to come along.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.680]   And those are the long lasting things that you want to hang on to anyways that bring
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:36.380]   you joy and can reflect back upon much more so than buying things.
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:41.680]   So focusing on experiences and creating memories with family and friends is one way to kind
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.480]   of break the mold and dip your toes into spending a little bit more money.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:51.160]   And over the last three, four years, what we've done is an Airbnb in a central area
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.120]   and paid for all of our kids to come and spend.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:58.920]   We bookend two weekends and the week in between they come whenever they can, all expenses
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:02.280]   paid and we just hang out and it's been wonderful.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:07.720]   And no guilt whatsoever in spending the money there.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.760]   - Thank you, Alan, yes.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:13.840]   And Ray, do you have a comment on that?
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:23.080]   - Hi, this is Raj, yeah, one way for us to deal with that problem is to gifting to the
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:29.200]   kids that 18,000 to one person from one of us.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.520]   So that's about 36,000 to each kid and we have got two kids.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:40.160]   So this way, we just have started giving them for the last several years now.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:47.040]   So that is one way we deal, we dealt with our problem, like in difficulty, spending
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.040]   our money.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.400]   - And you get to see the benefits, right?
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.800]   - Yeah, yeah, they seem to like it, they enjoy it.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.600]   And we like them, like enjoying themselves.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.960]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.640]   Versus if you were gone and they get it, you wouldn't see it.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.240]   - Right, with a warm hand rather than a cold hand.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:09.040]   - Yeah, as Alan said before, I told that to a lot of people in the last couple of weeks.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:15.360]   - Okay, let's go back to where we were at here.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.320]   I think we got one or more.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:24.080]   How often to take distributions, does anybody have any strategies on distributions?
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.600]   And are you talking about like, I don't know what they were talking about on the call,
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:33.120]   was it monthly or yearly or what was the issue here?
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.520]   - Yeah, I think that was it, whether to take it like the beginning of the year, the full
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.400]   year's worth or divide it up monthly.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   - Does anyone have any strategies that they're using?
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:53.200]   - Yeah, we usually take my wife's at the beginning of the year and I save mine for November or
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:26:01.800]   December because I pay 100% of our taxes from the previous year, have it withheld so that
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:12.400]   I don't have to do the quarterly estimated taxes, which I did for 40 years.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:19.720]   And it's considered to be any tax that's withheld is considered paid equally throughout the
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.760]   year.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:26.200]   So you get rid of the estimated taxes.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.400]   So that's the way we do it.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:35.480]   I know how much, I know that I've got enough in my RMD because it's fairly large to cover
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:39.560]   the taxes of the previous year, plus have some leftover.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:47.440]   So after I do my taxes for this year, I'll know how much I have to take from my RMD later
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.880]   in the year.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:54.520]   I don't bother to take it now because I can, I can adjust it over the course of the next
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.720]   six, eight, 10 months and get 5% or whatever.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.600]   And then I send it in at the end of the year.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.160]   So that's my strategy.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.980]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:12.360]   And finally, we have some, people can talk about the tools that they're using for retirement
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   planning.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.840]   I think we touched on this a couple of weeks ago also.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:18.440]   Somebody earlier in the call mentioned new retirement.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:23.920]   Is anybody else using any other tools?
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:29.320]   I think, Alan, you mentioned that Mark Zorrill, what was the thing you mentioned last time?
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.840]   - Well, yeah, there's Mark Zorrill at PlanVision.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.520]   He uses eMoney Advisor.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:40.520]   It's a relatively low cost way to access that tool and his expertise.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:46.040]   He has now, I think he has three, oh, three, Mark Zorrill, Jason Lynch, and somebody else
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.120]   that I believe that just joined their team.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.920]   For people who need a little more sophisticated modeling, even for basic modeling, it's a
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.680]   worthwhile approach.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:04.080]   Also, I personally really like Empower, formerly Personal Capital.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:09.600]   I think it has very fundamental but useful retirement modeling tools that I found very
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.600]   helpful.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.520]   And I actually am a client of Mark Zorrill's as well, and I've consulted with them a couple
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.720]   of times more or less just to confirm that I'm on track.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:26.240]   One individual I'll mention, a YouTube individual you're probably all familiar with or should
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:31.640]   be, and that's Rob Berger, who's been to the Boglehead Conference the past couple of years.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.040]   He served on the panel last year, I believe, or 2022.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:42.080]   He's excellent giving no-frills, objective advice from his website and YouTube channel.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:49.840]   And he said that he's going to start focusing, he's already building an online resource of
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:56.280]   all the available tools for financial, personal finance and retirement planning.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.600]   It's very rudimentary at this point.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.240]   One of his recent YouTube videos, he goes into a little bit more depth explaining what
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:07.000]   he's going to do with that, but that'll definitely be a resource to keep your eyes on as he'll
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.880]   be listing the pros, the cons, and delving a little bit into the details of each of these
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   tools.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.920]   And they're all a little bit different.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:19.400]   The one thing I might add is that remember that when you're using any online tool, there's
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:24.000]   usually embedded assumptions either that were built into the program or assumptions you're
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   making.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.560]   And we don't know the future.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.600]   We do not have a crystal ball.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.920]   So take everything, all the output with a grain of salt, because it could be that you're
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.280]   putting garbage in and getting out garbage results.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:41.320]   It's probably useful to have at least two, perhaps three different resources that you
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.000]   consult and see if they're roughly within agreeing with one another.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.960]   And even so, I still would be willing to change, adapt as your situation changes.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.960]   Okay.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.000]   Thank you, Allen.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.680]   There's a bunch of tools here.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.120]   I'll put this in the links.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.560]   Keith, do you want to talk about tools?
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:10.240]   I would just, you know, for me, you know, I guess I'm just thinking about calculators
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:13.640]   just to make sure that I was on track.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:18.040]   Fidelity did the 401(k) at the company that I was at.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.360]   And they had, I've mentioned this before, they had a tool where you could either make
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:28.840]   it more kind of general, you know, five or six inputs, or you could go and put in all
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.080]   of your expenses literally line by line.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.280]   I actually found that to be very helpful.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.940]   And I dug out all of our bills and said, okay, how do I feel that this is going to change
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:41.260]   in retirement?
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:47.440]   And was able to get a more manageable number in terms of what the expenses were going to
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.640]   look like versus the income that I was going to generate.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:58.900]   And then I kind of bounced that against the Monte Carlo simulation that Vanguard has.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:01.160]   And there was a third one that I use that escapes me.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.360]   It might've been Kiplinger.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:09.100]   And so when I used all three of those and all three of those came back positive, that's
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:15.920]   really when I felt more comfortable and kind of taking that plunge and feeling like I was
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.320]   on the right track.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.560]   So like you mentioned, Jim, you know, you do, or Alan might've mentioned it, you do
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.320]   several of them.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.840]   And if all of them kind of give you the same answer, that's probably, you know, something
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.440]   that you can not necessarily bank on, but at least feel comfortable with it.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:40.200]   And I would just mention also in terms of planning, you obviously need to be realistic
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.200]   with your inputs.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:46.840]   You know, a lot of them will ask you, what is your expected return, et cetera.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.120]   You want to be realistic in terms of what you're going to put in there, because just
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:58.160]   a variation of a percent or two on your return can have a fairly significant impact on what
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:01.420]   your numbers are going to look like.
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:06.560]   And then also with your expenses, you know, everything showed the rule of thumb being
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:13.120]   something like 70% of your expenses in retirement is what you can calculate.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.240]   And I found that to be incorrect.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:22.880]   Ours was closer to like 90 or 95% of what we had pre-retirement.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:29.920]   And so if I had used the 70% number that the benchmark or the rule of thumb was, I would
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.480]   have been a little more off in my numbers.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.940]   So be realistic with those numbers.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:40.320]   If you can find one that breaks down expenses by line, that's going to be more accurate
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.280]   than using that 70% benchmark.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.880]   Okay.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.880]   Thank you, Keith.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.880]   Jean?
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:51.560]   Ah, very cool, very cool comments there.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:57.240]   In the last meeting, there were several tools mentioned, and I made a list of them, and
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.920]   I sent them to Lady Geek.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:04.840]   And so we're going to post what I found, what I captured out of the chat with this
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:08.080]   meeting on your website.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:14.000]   So there was 10 tools mentioned, and I had no idea there was that many tools out there.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.020]   So Alan, you brought up a couple I don't think that are on my list.
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.720]   Maybe I'll send you the list too.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.800]   And you can add to it, and then we'll post it with this meeting so that people could
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   find tools.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:30.680]   If I can interject, Rob Berger is so thorough in how he is approaching this.
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:36.320]   I was going to suggest to Lady Geek that maybe rather than us trying to replicate that on
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:43.320]   the Bogleheads wiki, which is lacking, since it's constantly got to be updated, it might
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:47.480]   be one instance here where it might be better just to refer everybody over to Rob Berger's
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:48.480]   website.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.660]   I think where he's building this tool repository in the chat.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:58.500]   Has he got the list available now?
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.500]   Yes.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:04.640]   I just put in the chat, Jim, if you want to share your screen, click on that link for
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.960]   the Rob Berger tools, and you can just show them what's up there thus far.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.960]   Great then.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.280]   Because see, I went looking for tools and couldn't find anything.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.600]   Is it on the, is this it here?
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.600]   Is this what you're talking about?
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:21.600]   Yes.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:22.600]   I'll put that link in the chat.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.600]   Cool.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:24.600]   It's in the chat.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.840]   Then I won't bother to send it back to Lady Geek.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.400]   I'll tell her it's already done because all the tools on my list, I could see they're
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.400]   on there.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.400]   Cool.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.400]   Thanks.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.240]   I didn't know.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.320]   And I think we have videos on the site.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:44.680]   You can find them where we went through a number of retirement tools.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:49.720]   They've all probably been updated since then, but at least it gives you some tools to take
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.720]   a look at.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.160]   I'll put this in the chat also.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.160]   Great.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.880]   I had no idea that there was a list that you could go to, and if I had known that, I wouldn't
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.880]   have wasted my time.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.880]   Later.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:05.360]   One thing I can add that's very important, I know a lot of people are fearful of using
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:10.120]   online tools, especially if you're, it's an aggregator or you're linking your personal
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.120]   accounts.
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.280]   And that's very important to think about security and so forth.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.760]   There are tools that you can download and just do everything locally on your computer.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:22.740]   There are others where you can manually enter in information without having a link to your
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:23.740]   accounts.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:29.400]   And then there are others like Empower, formerly Personal Capital, and I think New Retirement
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:35.120]   and others that you actually can use one of the aggregators and link to your accounts.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:40.360]   It doesn't mean you have to, but you certainly need to be aware of what the security risks
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.360]   are.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:47.000]   With Personal Capital, Empower, you actually can manually enter everything in.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.920]   A lot of people are not aware of that.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.720]   I don't know about, I presume New Retirement as well offers that.
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:58.600]   I signed up for New Retirement, and you can manually enter or link.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.040]   And for security reasons, I manually entered.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.040]   So that's an important consideration with any of these tools.
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.040]   Uh-huh.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.040]   Uh-huh.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.040]   Agreed.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.040]   Okay.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.640]   And I think I was going with Rod Berger.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.640]   It's Rod Berger.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.160]   Somebody pointed out.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.160]   And this is the site here.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   Rod Berger.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.160]   Great.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.160]   Thank you, guys.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:22.480]   I think this is a great resource, because I had no idea there was that many resources
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.480]   out there, and I needed some help.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.840]   So it was really, I wanted to help others with it.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.800]   And there's the old, what is it called?
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800]   FireCalc?
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.440]   I haven't looked at this in a while.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.440]   Mm-hmm.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:37.440]   FireCalc was one that hit the list.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:45.640]   So if I would like to spend $40,000 a year, and I have a $1 million portfolio, let's say,
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:52.520]   and I want to go 30 years, I think what this thing does is it simulates some split between
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.760]   the S&P and bonds for 30 years with all the returns from the different years, like through
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.920]   the depression and all that.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.160]   And it says, "These are all your glide paths."
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:09.240]   So in this case, I've got a very small percent here chance that I would run out of money.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:14.680]   These cases below the red line, and it looks like there's three cases below the line.
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:17.000]   And I think they give you some results.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:24.940]   They're saying at 123 possible 30-year periods, you, I don't know where the results, six cycles
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:26.720]   failed out of the 123.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:32.040]   And it actually included, how far back did it go?
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.520]   It's got some historical data.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:38.360]   I don't know how long it goes, but it's kind of like a sequence of returns, like you started.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:44.960]   If this was the day the Great Depression started possibly, the purple line might be that.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:50.840]   And then maybe during the '70s, you did bad again, and then you did better in the '80s.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:51.840]   But that's the whole thing.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.840]   It just wraps around the various years sequentially, I believe.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.080]   And there's a number of tools like this that we reviewed.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:06.440]   But once you start, and it usually falls in line with a 4% withdrawal thing, right?
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:11.920]   I'm sure this is some of the baseline that everyone's come up with, to have come up with
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.600]   4% withdrawal rates.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:21.480]   It also points out that if everything goes well, you might end up with $6 million instead
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.480]   of being broke.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.480]   Big split between the two.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.480]   Big difference.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:36.280]   I mean, this is where a thing that's probably accurate to very little, even though it's
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:40.480]   very precise, to seven decimal points.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.220]   Okay.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.220]   Anybody else have tools?
[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:47.080]   If you want to, you can put them in the chat.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.520]   Raj has his hand up.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.520]   Raj, go ahead.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.520]   Sorry, I missed you.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.760]   I had a question about people who use the empower.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:02.200]   I have trouble deflecting those questions, those phone calls, which keep coming to me
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:08.600]   whenever I put my portfolio in the empower, and I wanted to have some clues how to go
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.280]   about it.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.760]   I've been using it for six years.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:12.760]   They called me twice.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.720]   I said I'm a do-it-yourselfer, not interested in their services, and I've never gotten another
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.720]   call from them.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:21.760]   Gee, for some reason, they keep calling me and I have to get down.
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.720]   You can change your phone number on the, put in, some people use a Google number, or I
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.880]   think you have to have a phone number in there, but don't make it your primary one and you
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:34.080]   can just block the, use your mobile number and block it.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.080]   Okay.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.080]   Maybe.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.080]   Okay.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.000]   Well, that's a good one, Alan.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:48.080]   Another small piece of information I have is I use a new retirement and I have Fidelity
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.680]   as my broker and Fidelity, you cannot really connect to the new retirement.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:58.620]   You have to have like, put it, put the numbers manually, you cannot really connect the Fidelity
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.620]   thing.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620]   So, okay.
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:02.520]   So Fidelity blocks it?
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.400]   No, Fidelity doesn't connect with new retirement.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:06.400]   Okay.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.400]   Interesting.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.400]   You cannot really.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:13.080]   So you have to put all your totals like, you know, manually.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:17.720]   So would you do that monthly or how long would it take you?
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:23.800]   Like, you know, you would do it maybe every six months once you are here, you don't have
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   to do it.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.800]   I don't do it like monthly.
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.800]   And how long does it take you every six months?
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:35.320]   Like, you know, depending on how many accounts you have, maybe if you have eight account
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:39.520]   or 10 accounts, like IRA, Roth IRAs and taxable.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.760]   So those numbers you need to put it in.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.040]   It takes me two hours.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.040]   Okay.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.040]   How about you Raj?
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.040]   How long does it take you?
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.880]   No, it doesn't take me that long.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:53.840]   Maybe an hour at the most.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.020]   Yeah, it might be worth it for the security risk.
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.080]   I don't trust anything anymore.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.080]   I don't either.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.640]   I wouldn't put all my information in that way.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640]   Okay.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:08.160]   We're going on almost two hours here.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.720]   So does anybody have any other topics they'd like to talk about?
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.480]   If they do, I see Sam has their hand raised.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:20.400]   Go ahead, Sam.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:28.760]   Like for example, in new retirement, how is it different than just the, I'm using Excel
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.720]   spreadsheet and just entering it in here.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:38.600]   What does it do more than just doing like what I do?
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.480]   I already know that I can retire.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.960]   Well, I am retired.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:52.400]   So what, what is this for?
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.640]   And I would suggest you watch one of the YouTube videos that demonstrates all the features
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.000]   of new retirement or any other tool there.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.480]   They're far, they're all very in their sophistication, but there's a lot more than just a spreadsheet.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:12.240]   But one thing I'll add that I like what I most like about the empower tool is that it
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.360]   breaks down your holdings into their actual sub asset classes.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:21.920]   If you've got a balanced fund, it breaks it down into whether it's bonds, stocks, large
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.640]   cap, small cap, you know, and so forth, breaks all your bonds down to the appropriate sub
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:29.320]   classes.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:35.680]   And it shows you your entire portfolio, the actual true asset allocation.
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.760]   Whereas something like the Vanguard, for instance, Vanguard portfolio watch is horrible.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.760]   It just may classify their small cap value fund is a hundred percent small cap value
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.820]   when in fact it's a mix of mid cap and small cap, and it's not all value.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:58.000]   So I find that tools that can do a much more sophisticated breakdown versus a spreadsheet.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.440]   And I've got a custom spreadsheet myself that I've toyed with, but I can't get it to break
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.080]   down all my holdings that are, have mixed classes.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:13.240]   So I'd like to see that and help me rebalance, but there's a lot more they can do just Monte
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:17.920]   Carlo analysis and Charmin, you know, spending strategy.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:22.440]   Some of them new retirement, I think has a Roth conversion tool as does e-money advisor
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:27.600]   can model Roth conversions, but you have to use the plan vision service because they need
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.680]   to customize that for you.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.120]   I'm sure as these tools become more and more sophisticated, they'll all veer off into different
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:39.940]   directions with some overlapping features and some that are unique to each tool.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.520]   Thank you, Alan.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:43.520]   That is useful.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:54.560]   So it seems that you do slice and dice where I only have one fund, total stock market index
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.560]   fund period.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.800]   That's a good one.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:00.440]   That brings up a very important point that we didn't discuss.
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:05.320]   If you don't mind me bringing that up is about how, how we should try to simplify our portfolio
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:12.000]   as we enter into retirement, both by consolidating accounts as, as best we can, and then simplifying
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.040]   our holdings.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:16.880]   Because if we have, if we happen to have a spouse, significant other who might ultimately
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:23.800]   inherit a complicated sliced and diced portfolio they may not be comfortable handling that.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:27.060]   And as we get older, we don't want to necessarily spend as much time.
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:31.920]   Those of us on this, on this zoom are probably for the most part, you know, personal finance
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.520]   geeks, but our, our significant others may not be, nor our kids.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:44.000]   And simplifying things and make it understandable and also including your plans and, and philosophy
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.400]   in your investment policy statement for others that may need to deal with it after we're
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:54.920]   incapacitated or no longer here is other, another useful step.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.020]   That's something I'm working on.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:01.600]   So there's a lot more to consider other considerations as well to make our lives simpler and the
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.880]   simpler our overall finances and portfolios are, as we enter in retirement means we'll
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.160]   have more time to spend on other activities, such as figuring out how to spend our money.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.360]   Okay.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.960]   Or going to therapy to spend your money.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:18.960]   Thank you.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.960]   You're welcome.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:20.960]   Thank you, Sam.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.960]   How about 14056?
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:32.160]   Try not to throw rotten eggs at me, but I've been toying with the idea of getting an annuity.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.680]   And for a couple reasons, it's going to force me to take out the money and I have a cash
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:37.320]   flow issue.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:45.480]   And also I can, if I do it with my 401k, I could start to peel down some of that, you
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.680]   know, nastiness that's going to hit me when my R and D kicks in.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.600]   I had two people bring up two things.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.980]   One person said the only annuity they would consider was a SPIA, S-P-I-A.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:04.240]   And then another option was a fixed index that would, and either of these could be like
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.060]   just 10 years rather than a lifetime.
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.720]   So I'm going to throw it out.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:16.320]   And if there's any annuity that you guys think is not as nearly as odious as the others,
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.360]   please let me know.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:26.280]   No, I think Wade Fowler has talked a lot about the fact that you can't really annuitize yourself.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:34.560]   So, you know, and I think the recommendation is usually for the SPIA, isn't it, Alan?
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:41.480]   Yes, single premium immediate annuity, which is the simplest, lowest commission, lowest
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:47.200]   cost approach, which in some instances is very reasonable.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:53.640]   Would you, right now, you know, I can't imagine myself living like my dad did who died at
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:47:00.420]   99 and he was going to the gym at age 97 three times a week.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:05.320]   But would you consider like if I did like a five-year or a 10-year or something just
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.880]   to kind of see how it goes?
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:14.760]   And I don't know, you know, I visited somebody who wanted to see me put around $650,000 in
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:20.800]   a lifetime annuity and, you know, yeah, believe me, I wasn't going to hand over my money without
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.440]   really studying this.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:28.640]   But I started to think that maybe, and I did a calculator, you know, I can't remember who
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:32.200]   it was, whether it was a Fidelity calculator or whatever.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.460]   There's an intermediateannuities.com or something.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:42.480]   And I thought like, you know, a SPIA with 10-year SPIA seemed like it was kind of like
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:46.960]   an okay idea.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.960]   That might have been where I went.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:48.960]   Yeah, this is it.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.600]   Yeah, that's where I exactly where I went.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.920]   Okay.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:48:03.020]   To help you, Marilyn Dower did a one, I think, one hour, one and a half hour overview on
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:11.520]   annuities and we recorded it is on the Sacramento Bogleheads YouTube channel.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.760]   And he did a wonderful job explaining all the annuities, pros and cons.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:21.000]   And I think he's no longer on the call, so he probably wouldn't speak about the fact
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.220]   that we've got it recorded and it's a wealth of information.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.320]   Thank you.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:30.160]   And I think this is the Wade Fowl article or something about it.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.680]   Yeah, right here.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.400]   I'll put this in the chat also.
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.920]   One thing important to note is that, of course, annuities nowadays don't offer any cost of
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.880]   living adjustment, which is a bit of a concern, but instead of buying a single, if you're
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.680]   going to purchase an annuity, especially a SPIA, what you could do is instead of buying
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:54.560]   one single one is kind of build a ladder of two or three annuities at various times.
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:00.280]   And that way you may get some inflation benefit from that based upon the current market conditions
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.280]   and interest rates.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:06.200]   Split it up instead of one lump sum, divide it into three and divide it up over a period
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.080]   of time to purchase them.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:13.680]   So then maybe I should start with like a five year and kind of see how it goes and make
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:14.680]   it small.
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:17.880]   But you know, you can make it so small that what they're really giving you every month
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.200]   is not is chicken feed.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:27.120]   Well, and then Harry Sitt, the finance buff, also does a lot of conversation about annuities.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:33.120]   And I think he talks about laddering annuities, Alan, to your point.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.400]   So that might be another resource for you.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   Thank you.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.720]   Okay, Sam, did you have another question?
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:47.380]   Yeah, back to Alan talking about simplifying our accounts.
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:56.480]   In addition to simplifying the number of funds, like me only holding one index fund for stock.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:05.200]   And then you go so we can simplify the number of the brokerage account, like for example.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:15.160]   But if I put everything into Fidelity, then it will be big.
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:23.880]   Instead of diversifying the risk between Vanguard and Fidelity and Merrill, it will be all in
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.600]   Fidelity and if Fidelity goes under, I'm done.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:29.600]   What do you think?
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.440]   Fidelity, any of these brokerages, they don't hold the assets.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.520]   There's another holding company.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.460]   So there's no risk there in losing everything.
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:44.880]   The bigger risk would be if there's a breach, a security breach, and you lose access to
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.080]   your account for a while until that's rectified.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:50.480]   That's a bigger concern.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:56.000]   So it's always a good idea to have some other bank account, checking account, maybe another
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.080]   account somewhere outside of a brokerage.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:04.000]   I personally have no qualms about holding all my money at Vanguard, although it turns
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.280]   out for another reason I have some money at Fidelity, but what are everybody's thoughts
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.280]   on that?
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:15.040]   That's oftentimes posted on the forum and that's, I think, not a valid concern about
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:24.400]   Fidelity or Vanguard or Schwab or anybody else going under and losing your assets there.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.600]   No, but somebody made a comment.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:33.160]   I think Margo made a comment about the concern about the long-term annuities and the solvency
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:34.880]   of the company.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:37.840]   And I think there's some kind of cross-insurance between these companies.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:41.960]   I don't understand it all because they really don't want the word to get out that annuities
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:46.880]   don't pay out and they're just liquidate and screw everybody over.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:49.020]   Does anybody know about that?
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:50.840]   Maybe Mel knows about it?
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:55.960]   I was told that the annuity actually has a little bit of an insurance policy.
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:03.400]   The annuity companies, the insurance companies have insurance policies, not a ton, but some.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:08.560]   Well, it's a state issue and it varies from state to state.
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:12.620]   Typically it's around $250,000.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:22.020]   So it pays to go with different insurers and it pays to make sure that you stay under the
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:28.820]   amount that you're guaranteed by the state, especially if you're going out a little bit
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:38.880]   on the risk, the companies are ranked and the lower the ranking, the higher the payout
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:39.880]   normally is.
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:45.500]   But a lot of people are tempted to go down on the risk scale and on the safety scale
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.140]   and will buy to get a little more.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:52.620]   And in a situation like that, you want to make sure that you stay under, know what your
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:57.780]   state policy covers and stay under that.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:02.080]   So Mel, are you saying if I was in a state where it's limited to $250,000 and I plopped
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:08.300]   down a million bucks and they went insolvent tomorrow, they'd give me back the state guarantee
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:12.320]   or I'd only get $250,000 back?
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.320]   That is a possibility.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:18.000]   Now, of course, you've always got the other thing where the other insurance companies
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:27.060]   come in and buy the ... But the problem is, is that as with some assets, there's still
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:30.020]   assets to be had by whoever takes them over.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:36.080]   But in this case here, they got a half a million or a million dollars and if they've already
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:40.560]   blown it, there's not really a lot of assets for them to take over because all they're
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:45.480]   taking over is debt, the annuity to pay out.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:52.840]   So I would say that either go with top rated companies if you're going to go over the insurance
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:54:01.240]   amount or stick with the lower, if you're going to go down on the risk scale or safety
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:06.280]   scale, buy from mobile companies.
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:09.160]   And there's nothing wrong because somebody mentioned it before, I'm not sure whether
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:19.360]   it was you or Alan, but one of the ways to offset inflation is to buy one today and buy
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:23.800]   another one a couple of years from now and a couple of years from now, instead of putting
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:30.760]   it all out right now, unless you feel that this rate is as good as you're going to get.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:36.200]   In other words, if it's an exceptional period where the rates that they're paying is extremely
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:38.600]   high, then you may go for it.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:45.080]   But if the rates are low, you might buy some today and some a year or two from now and
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.000]   some a year, a couple of years after that.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.800]   So you're laddering it, which also helps to offset inflation and gives you a safety feature.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.560]   Okay, thank you, Mel.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.760]   Somebody had posted, I think Matthew posted in the chat about a comparison of fixed index
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:13.160]   annuities and bonds by an article by Wade Pfau and Alan Roth there.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:15.880]   I posted that in the chat here, he did.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:23.260]   Well, just to, now Wade of course is associated with the insurance industry, so there's always
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:26.660]   that possibility, something you have to keep in mind.
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:35.900]   I did a six-column series at Forbes on annuities, which are still up and people can search for
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:42.780]   them and go through the whole series and it goes over all the different types and the
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:47.160]   things to look out for in that.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:55.940]   So all you have to do is search for Forbes Lindauer and it should bring them up.
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:56:04.660]   I wanted to say that Taylor Laramore has two SPIAs, single premium index annuities.
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:10.740]   I think, Mel, I can't remember, I think he bought one, his first one in his 70s and his
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:17.400]   second one maybe in his 80s and he's now, he just turned 100 years old and they're still
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.400]   paying him.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:24.880]   And in fact, his son told me that every year Taylor gets a letter from the annuity company
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:27.880]   and says, "Are you still alive?
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:28.880]   Are you still there?"
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:31.880]   And he asked to sign the letter and send it back.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:36.780]   Yeah, Taylor is one of the ones that really made out on it.
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:41.200]   I heard rumors that they fired the guy that wrote him.
