[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]   (music)
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.400]   Welcome back.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.480]   This Monday morning, we begin our new week together asking whether we should encourage
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.800]   non-Christians to pray for faith, or is a faithless prayer like that basically pointless?
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.800]   Here's the question.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.920]   "Dear Pastor John, my name is Jeff, and I am a PhD student in Los Angeles.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.140]   My question is about faith.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.800]   Many times I have been evangelizing my friends and they say that they admire my faith, but
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.300]   they don't possess faith like mine.
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720]   They have difficulty believing themselves.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.760]   I always tell them that God generously supplies faith, and it's not something I mustered up
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   myself.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.200]   I might show them 1 Peter 1.3, that He, God, caused us to be born again, or 1 Corinthians
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.560]   2, verses 11 to 14, we receive the Spirit that we might understand.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.680]   What should I tell someone who realizes that God gives us faith, but who feels stuck waiting
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040]   for God to give them that faith?
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.120]   The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God until they've been given
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.000]   by the Spirit.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.920]   Or should a faithless person not pray at all, or do they simply wait until God may or may
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.080]   not give His Spirit?
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.160]   Pastor John, what counsel would you have for Jeff?"
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.840]   Well, first, let me agree with Jeff.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.080]   Saving faith is humanly impossible.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:39.580]   The fallen, sinful, spiritually dead human soul does not have the moral ability to believe.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:48.420]   They have the mental powers, they have the powers of volition, but the heart is so bent
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.660]   away from God, it cannot make itself prefer God.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.780]   You can't make yourself love God.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.180]   You can't make yourself treasure God.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.400]   You can't make yourself rely upon God if you are dead and bent away from God.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.340]   When the rich young man turned away from Jesus and refused to follow Him in love with his
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.580]   money, Jesus said, "It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.380]   a rich person to enter the heaven."
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.420]   And His disciples threw up their hands and said, "Well, who then can be saved?"
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.500]   And Jesus didn't respond by saying, "Oh, you over-interpreted my words."
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.820]   He didn't say that.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.680]   He said, "With man it is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.260]   And Paul underscored this condition of the natural human heart with the words, "The natural
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.860]   person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.600]   is not able, he cannot understand them because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:05.640]   And again, in Romans 8, 7—that was 1 Corinthians 2, 14—in Romans 8, 7, he said, "The mind
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.680]   of the flesh," that is, the natural mind, the unregenerate, unconverted, non-born-again
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.720]   mind, "is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot."
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.900]   Or again, Ephesians 2, 5, "We were dead in our trespasses, and that's how God found us
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.140]   and made us alive."
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.900]   That deadness included a blindness to the glory of Christ.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.080]   The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.600]   light of the gospel of the glory of Christ in the image of God.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:52.280]   Christ does not look glorious or supremely valuable or desirable to the fallen human
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   heart.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.320]   A new birth is needed, a spiritual resurrection.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.400]   Yet the command remains for unbelievers to believe.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:15.360]   God has the right to require from humans what they ought to render to him, even if sin has
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.500]   made that rendering humanly impossible.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:30.600]   We are responsible to do what we ought to do, even if we are so bad we won't and thus
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.280]   can't do it.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.800]   For example, Acts 16, 31, "The jailer cried out, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'"
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.580]   And they say, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved."
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.720]   And Paul isn't the first to command the impossible.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.760]   Like Ezekiel looked out on a field of dry bones and prophesied, "Hey, dry bones, live!"
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.400]   And they did.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.340]   Jesus did the same in John 11 with Lazarus.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.200]   He spoke to a dead man.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.020]   Lazarus come forth and he did.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:15.960]   And Jesus sends us, he sent Paul and us out to do the same, the same impossible thing.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:24.920]   He said in Acts 26, 17, "I am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.560]   darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God."
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:37.240]   Human evangelism is indispensable in the miracle that God works to raise the spiritually dead
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.000]   and give them saving faith.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.160]   I planted a pulse, watered, God gave the growth.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.600]   Humans plant, humans water, absolutely essential.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.520]   And God does the impossible.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.840]   He gives life.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   The reason faith is impossible for spiritually dead sinners is not that spiritually dead
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:09.440]   sinners can't make decisions, but that faith is more than a decision.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.560]   Saving faith is a treasuring faith, a treasuring trust.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.680]   Faith involves seeing Christ not just as useful for getting out of hell or getting well or
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.480]   getting rich.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.680]   Saving faith sees Christ as glorious, better than any other treasure in the world.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:39.720]   That's why faith is not possible for sin-loving, self-exalting humans unless they are born
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.440]   again.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.040]   We must be born again.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.920]   What Peter says, and now we're getting close to the issue that was raised, Peter says the
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.440]   miracle of the new birth comes by the Word.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:05.760]   In other words, alongside 1 Peter 1.3, that Jeff quotes, "God caused us to be born again."
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   God caused us to be born again.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.800]   Alongside that, we must put 1 Peter 1.23.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.920]   So beside 1.3, put 1.23, "You have been born again through the living and abiding Word
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.200]   of God.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.620]   For all flesh is like grass, and its glory like the flower of grass.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.180]   The grass withers, the flower falls, but the Word of the Lord remains forever, and this
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.580]   Word is the good news that was preached to you."
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:41.360]   Now that implies two things in answer to Jeff's question about what to say to an unbeliever
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:50.880]   who listens to all of this and feels paralyzed as if the only thing he can do is simply wait,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.520]   like lie in bed, sit in a chair, and wait for the gift of faith.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.440]   The first thing it implies is that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:10.240]   or to use Peter's words, new birth comes by hearing.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.960]   Hearing by the Word of God.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   Therefore, the absolutely key thing to say to the unbeliever is keep reading the Word
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   of God.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.280]   Keep listening on your app to the Word of God.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.600]   Keep pondering the Word of God.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Don't be passive.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.320]   Here's a book, read it.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.760]   Be greedy, greedy, greedy for understanding the Word as greedy as you are for silver and
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.120]   gold.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.240]   This is how faith is sustained for believers.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.920]   This is how faith comes into being and is awakened for unbelievers.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.800]   Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.280]   New birth comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.640]   Keep exposing yourself to the Word of God in whatever way you can, and believer, keep
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.000]   putting it forward.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.400]   The other thing implied in 1 Peter 1 is that we should encourage the unbeliever to call
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:25.760]   out to God for eyes to see and ears to hear and a mind to understand.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:32.520]   Remember the man who cried out, "I believe, help my unbelief," in Mark 9?
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:38.560]   I think he could have said, "Oh God, help my unbelief."
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   Period.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:48.200]   In the Old Testament, several times we are taught that those who feel unable, in other
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:54.640]   words paralyzed, trapped in their own inability, in their own sin, they feel unable to return
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.880]   to God should cry out.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.520]   This is an exact quote from Lamentations 5.21, "Cause me to return and I will return, oh
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   God."
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.000]   Isn't that an amazing prayer?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.320]   "Cause me to return and I will return.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.120]   Enable me and I will be able.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.040]   Make me come and I will come."
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.960]   Do whatever it takes, God, so we encourage the unbeliever to pray.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:30.200]   Besides keeping the Word before unbelievers and encouraging them to pray, I would mention
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.760]   one more thing.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.840]   Keep leaning in to their lives personally with care.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.640]   Keep communicating, not to make yourself a nuisance.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:49.240]   You need spiritual discernment to know when that's happening, but to show them that you
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:58.840]   really do want them to believe and be saved, to be your everlasting brother or sister with
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.720]   God forever in joy.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   Just as God may open their eyes to see the glory of Christ in the gospel, he may also
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.320]   open their eyes to see the love of Christ in your concern.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   Yeah, amen.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.560]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.800]   You can ask a question of your own, search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast,

[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.800]   Well speaking of faith, believers also fight for faith, especially in this age of entertainment
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   and comfort.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.320]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.760]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday to talk about fighting for faith in the entertainment
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   age.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.760]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.000]   1
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Now, I'm going to ask you to take a moment and just pray for us.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.320]   I'm going to ask you to pray for us.
