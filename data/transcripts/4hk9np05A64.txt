[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   There was a unique unipolar moment that happens very rarely in history, where the anglosphere
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.120]   had much more power in the 90s and early 2000s than the rest of the world.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.240]   Is there something you wish, in the way the institutions were set up at the time and were
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.160]   cared for now, that you would maybe change? There was a key opportunity in the unipolar moment. How
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.080]   should that have been used? How well was it used? I think it was myself and President Clinton who
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:35.120]   took the crucial decision to bring China into the world's trading framework. The G7 at the time was
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.440]   the G8, with Russia there, and China would always be invited. I think we did try. I honestly think
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.920]   we tried a lot to recognize that we were going to live in a new world. The power was going to
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.320]   not shift from the West, in the sense that the West would become not powerful, but the East was
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.400]   going to become also powerful. I think we kind of did understand that and worked towards that.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.680]   The problem is that, and particularly in these last few years, certainly China and Russia have
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.600]   come to a position that is, in terms of fundamental values and systems, seemingly hostile
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.360]   to Western democracy. We live in a multipolar world today. Personally, I think that's a good
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.240]   thing. I think in any event, it's an inevitable thing. I think it's really important always to
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:44.400]   give this message to China, for example. China, as of right, is one of the big powers in the world,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.280]   and as of right, should have a huge influence. I don't believe in trying to constrain or contain
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.920]   China, but we do have to accept that the Chinese system, as it presently is, is run on different
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:08.320]   lines to our own and is overtly, in some degree, hostile; which is why it's important for us to
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.800]   retain military and technological superiority, even though I believe passionately that it's
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.240]   important that we leave space for cooperation and engagement with China. Now, how much could we have
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.640]   foreseen of all of this back in those days? I'm not sure, but I think sometimes one of the problems
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.160]   of the West is that we always see it through our own lens, and we always think, "Well, we could
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.040]   have done something different to change the world." But actually, the rest of the world operates on
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.200]   its own principles as well. Sometimes the change happens not because we didn't do something,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.040]   but because the rest of the world did.
