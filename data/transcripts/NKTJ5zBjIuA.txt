[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   I care a lot about not just minimizing my taxes, but also minimizing penalties,
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.100]   interest, and honestly, problems.
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.720]   The more busy you get, especially in business, but honestly, in any area,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.860]   like I know how painful it is to work with the IRS.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.100]   Like, even if I got audited today, I would be stressed about it.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.860]   I'd be in the driver's seat, so I'm not going to like crazy worry, but it
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.660]   would stress me out because I know just the time it takes would be honestly
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.900]   a huge loss in money to me, right?
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.040]   Huge loss in energy, effort, everything.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.340]   So everything I do is built around that.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.300]   And obviously transcripts is one of them.
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.580]   I like to actually extend so that I have a clean, I want one return, submit it.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.100]   That's it.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.580]   And then everything I do is clean.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.540]   So it's like, if I think I'm going to assume the IRS is looking at my return.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.020]   If there's anything that they're going to be like, Hmm, that doesn't look good.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.620]   I would prefer to not make it stand out without misrepresenting.
