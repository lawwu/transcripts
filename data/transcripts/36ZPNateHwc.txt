[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   A wife and mom in southern England writes in, "She is perplexed and frustrated and
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   is obvious why.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.040]   Dear Pastor John and Tony, thank you for this podcast and the ways that you have approached
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.520]   so many topics with care and godly insight.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.300]   I have been hugely helped by episodes 548, 'How Do I Honor God in Chronic Pain?'
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.960]   and episode 1243, 'I Have Chronic Fatigue, How Do I Not Waste My Life?'
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.660]   These episodes directly apply to me as a disabled mother of a two-year-old and a newborn.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.040]   My disability causes constant pain and significantly limits my physical activity.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.560]   I am grateful for a husband who will do anything he can to reduce my burdens, although he himself
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.560]   has health conditions which limit his ability to physically help as well."
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.800]   Proverbs 31 paints a picture of a vigorous, invaliant, and strong wife, up early, late
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.120]   to bed, endlessly busy inside and outside of the household.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.320]   When I look at this example and at the parents in our church without my physical limitations,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.400]   it is very easy to feel confused about my practical role as a wife, and anxious about
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.700]   investing positively in my children.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.080]   Many attractive aspects of our friends' parenting, such as homeschooling, are unlikely
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.080]   for us.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.760]   How do I build a vision for parenting faithfully through my limitations and deal with my guilt?
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.640]   Over the things I cannot do.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.000]   I've been thinking recently about the caution that C.S. Lewis gave to the person who was
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.360]   judging a Christian's patience or gentleness without taking into account his natural temperament
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.240]   that he was born with.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.440]   The problem had arisen from the fact that there was an unbeliever who seemed a lot more
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.920]   patient and gentle than this particular believer.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.040]   So the critic wondered, "Well, what good is it to say that God has saved this person
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.520]   and is in the process of sanctifying them?
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.280]   They're no better than an unbeliever."
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.120]   Suppose you have a scale of 1 to 10, and the 1 represents a person who is totally impatient
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.440]   and completely without any gentleness at all, a perfect hothead.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.960]   And 10 represents a person who is perfectly patient and perfectly gentle in all the ways
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.340]   that we should be.
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.200]   Then you find that there's a Christian who's a 5 on this scale between 1 and 10.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   And there's an unbeliever who, as far as you can see outwardly, is a 7 on the scale
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.880]   of 1 to 10.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   And Lewis asks, "Can you say from this that the Holy Spirit is a weaker sanctifying influence
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   in the life of the believer than the natural influences are in the life of the unbeliever?"
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.040]   And his answer is no.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.160]   No.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.600]   You can't say that because, as far as you know, the unbeliever was born with a temperament
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   of 7.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:26.080]   He's simply by nature phlegmatic in his personality, while the believer may have been born a 1
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.360]   and is by nature a Vesuvius of bad temper, so that being a 5 is an incredible miracle.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.080]   I'll tell you, when I read this years ago, I was just blown away with helpfulness.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.680]   I wonder why, right?
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.000]   I wonder why I look in the mirror.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.400]   Now I think that caution, that wisdom, not to judge without knowing all the factors that
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   shape a person's personality and achievements, applies to lots of areas of life besides patience
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.720]   and gentleness.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.760]   And the principle is very relevant when it comes to this particular case of our young
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.520]   mom with a disability.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:26.920]   And the principle is God doesn't measure the form of our faithfulness by the form of somebody
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   else's faithfulness, who may have started from a very different place.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.000]   Faithfulness always matters.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.960]   The form of the faithfulness differs according to hundreds of circumstances.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:58.320]   So Proverbs 31 describes the form of faithfulness in the life of an ancient woman—that is,
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.540]   a woman from antiquity—in the full bloom of her health and strength.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.520]   It doesn't describe the form of faithfulness for a woman who is deaf and blind in her 80s,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.560]   for a woman who's recently married at age 16, just beginning to discover what wisdom
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.920]   is.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.040]   And it doesn't describe the form of the faithfulness of a woman with disabilities that might keep
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.800]   her from planting a vineyard or putting her hand to the spindle or rising while it is
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.600]   still dark or even clothing herself.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:45.520]   So a woman with such a disability must search the Scriptures to find the form of faithfulness
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.540]   that applies to her.
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:54.940]   And she won't have to look far, because right here in chapter 31 of Proverbs, there are
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.600]   beautiful forms of faithfulness that she can pursue.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:10.320]   Trustworthiness—verse 11—not harming her husband's reputation with an idle tongue,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.960]   being financially astute—verse 16—being generous with the poor as much as her resources
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.560]   allow—verse 20—laughing at the time to come because her faith is unshakable in the
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.240]   goodness and sovereignty of God—verse 25—overflowing with the teaching of kindness and wisdom—verse
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:39.560]   26—and finally, the beauty that really counts, captured in verse 30—charm is deceitful,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.240]   beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:55.840]   I don't discount the difficulties and challenges that test this woman's faith as she is unable
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.920]   to do some of the things that other mothers do.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:09.880]   And I would encourage her not to begrudge the thorn that God has apparently given her,
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.880]   at least for now.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.520]   He's a great healer.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   Who knows?
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:22.600]   But for now, this thorn, like Paul's thorn in the flesh, that thorn in 2 Corinthians
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.800]   12, limited what Paul could do.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.120]   It changed the form of his faithfulness.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.280]   He will not be held accountable to be productive in the same ways.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:44.160]   The test now is not, "Would he be productive?" but "Would he be content?"
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.720]   That's how the sufficiency of Christ will be magnified.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.060]   God does not put as high a premium on productivity as we think he does.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:03.080]   He puts a much higher premium on the qualities of character, the fruits of the Spirit, that
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.360]   you can exercise flat on your back in a hospital bed.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.840]   I don't say it's easy.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.080]   I do say it's possible.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:19.080]   The form of faithfulness for a paraplegic, for example, is different than the form of
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.300]   faithfulness for an Olympic athlete.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.780]   One person is given ten talents, another person is given five.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:32.220]   The form of their faithfulness is not measured by the same set of achievements.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:40.780]   I would encourage our dear friend to focus on a text like Psalm 147.10.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:48.700]   God's delight is not in the strength of the horse nor his pleasure in the legs of a man,
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:57.340]   but the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:06.060]   Strength and beauty are wonderful gifts, but they are as nothing—let me say that again—they
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:13.940]   are as nothing compared to the fear of the Lord and the heart that hopes in God's steadfast
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.940]   love.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:22.460]   So, when this young mother looks in the mirror or measures herself by the strength of a horse
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:32.140]   or the legs of the healthy supermom, remember the words of Samuel in 1 Samuel 16.7.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.660]   The Lord sees not as man sees.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.060]   Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.140]   1 Samuel 16.7.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:51.540]   There is a kind of beauty and there is a kind of strength and there is a kind of mothering
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:10:00.940]   that God has designed for every disabled mom who will look to Christ and trust him.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.260]   Wonderfully compassionate and encouraging.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.780]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.

[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:20.420]   Well, there are right ways to correct other believers, and there are wrong ways to correct
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.420]   other believers.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.420]   So, what's the difference?
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.100]   Romans 14 will help us understand that difference.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.740]   Pastor John will explain next time.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.140]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.460]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.060]   Thanks for listening.
