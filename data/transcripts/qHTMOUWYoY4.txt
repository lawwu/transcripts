[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]   What you've done, and it seems so genius to me,
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.220]   is you've actually turned the deals into a side hustle
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.940]   so that you can generate income.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.940]   - Well, it's been a couple decades of doing this,
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.900]   but primarily it really ramped up
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.820]   when my wife and I did the FIRE,
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.660]   the early retirement thing,
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.920]   and we wanted a way to kind of supplement our income
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.000]   because you're on a kind of a tighter budget
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.920]   when you do FIRE.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.400]   Profitable deals, it's one of those things
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.240]   where you can tackle a whole plethora of things
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.840]   that people often don't think about.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.440]   You know, credit cards, I think, are the main things
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.280]   people think about when it comes to sign-up bonuses,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.400]   but there's this whole avenue of bank bonuses,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.320]   brokerage bonuses, meal kits that you can do
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.880]   that can really make you a lot of money,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.160]   and that's for us, like, in the last couple of years,
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.760]   you know, I think 2023, we made $36,000
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.280]   doing these profitable deals,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880]   and two and a half million points the year before
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.960]   was $32,000 and a million points,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.400]   so it's been slowly kind of climbing up in that sense,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.240]   and I think we're on track to make even more this year.
