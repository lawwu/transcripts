[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   (music)
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.400]   The Apostle Paul, writing in 1 Timothy 1:15,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.500]   declared himself to be the world's worst sinner.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.700]   The world's worst sinner.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.200]   So is that hyperbole?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   Or is that apostolic self-deprecation?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200]   Or is that true?
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.300]   Was Paul really the world's worst sinner?
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.600]   You want to know?
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.900]   I want to know?
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.600]   A listener named Joel wants to know,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.400]   and so we ask Pastor John.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.200]   Joel writes this, "Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.800]   Paul makes this claim in 1 Timothy 1:15,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.900]   the saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance,
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.600]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.400]   of whom I am the foremost."
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.600]   The foremost.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.800]   Must be true, because this is the authoritative word of God.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.500]   But is Paul exaggerating his claim here?
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.400]   The context seems to suggest that
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.100]   Paul meant he was truly the worst sinner.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.300]   He goes on to say in verse 16 that he was saved as an example,
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300]   that if he, the chief of sinners, was saved,
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.800]   then surely others can be saved as well.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   So was Paul really the world's worst sinner?
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.200]   Paul said, "The saying is trustworthy
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.500]   and deserving of full acceptance,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.100]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.500]   of whom I am foremost.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.900]   But I receive mercy for this reason,
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.900]   that in me, as in the foremost,
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.500]   Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.200]   as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life."
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.000]   So the claim really does seem to mean
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.800]   foremost among all sinners, not just a little group,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.200]   because he is comparing himself
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   with all those whom Christ came to save.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.700]   He says, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.600]   and among that group, I'm the foremost."
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   That's all sinners, at least all at that time.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.400]   The word behind foremost,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.900]   the Greek word behind the English word foremost,
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.500]   is protos, which simply means first.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.800]   I'm first.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.700]   It's used 155 times in the New Testament,
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.000]   almost always meaning first temporally.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.100]   Well, Paul doesn't mean that.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.000]   He doesn't mean temporally,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.900]   as if there were no sinners before him,
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.200]   like I'm the first sinner.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.400]   He doesn't mean that.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.200]   He means first in line, measured on some other scale,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.700]   not temporally, but some other scale.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.600]   So the task is to figure out from the context what scale.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.300]   I mean, how is he the first, the foremost,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.900]   before others in what way, what criteria?
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.600]   And Paul gives us three scales, so to speak.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.400]   In verse 13, "Formerly I was a," number one,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.000]   "blasphemer," number two, "persecutor,"
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.800]   number three, "insolent opponent."
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.400]   Let's just take those one at a time and see how he measures,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.700]   how he's thinking about his firstness.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.100]   "Blasphemer."
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.900]   This means he spoke.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   He spoke.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.300]   "Blasphemer" means something you do your mouth.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.500]   He spoke demeaning lies about Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.400]   His words directed people away from the truth about Jesus.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.900]   His words tarred and feathered Jesus with false descriptions.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.400]   They belittled Jesus and mocked Jesus.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.100]   His words treated Jesus as a pretender, in effect, a liar.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.200]   Paul could not argue with any credibility that Jesus did not exist.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.900]   Good grief, he lived at the same time.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.500]   So he had to argue that Jesus put himself forward as something he wasn't.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.300]   He was a hoax.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.600]   And when you treat someone that way, the seriousness of the sin rises with the glory and dignity of the person you're demeaning.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:27.200]   So Paul considered his slanderous language about Jesus as the first thing to be mentioned in his unworthiness.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.500]   So that's where he starts.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   Second, "persecutor."
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.100]   He went way beyond words.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.200]   Now, these are cumulative.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.800]   He's mounting things up here.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.900]   And I think the third one's going to be the climax.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.400]   But here we are at number two.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.600]   He's a persecutor.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.800]   He went way beyond words.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.500]   He pursued people to prison.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.600]   He oversaw the murder of Christians.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.100]   Here's the way Luke puts it in Acts 9.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.800]   Saul, still breathing out threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:08.100]   asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus so that he could, if he found any belonging to the "way"—that's Christianity—men or women,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.500]   he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.600]   And what would happen there?
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.400]   Perhaps stoning.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:29.500]   In Galatians 1, verse 13, he says, "You have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:40.300]   And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers."
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:52.000]   So when he connects his aim to destroy the church with his advancing beyond any other zealous peers in Judaism,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.900]   I think he meant nobody went after the church like I did.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   Nobody.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:05.200]   My murderous, imprisoning, persecuting efforts to destroy the church were literally unsurpassed.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.800]   I think that's just literally true.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.600]   I think Paul said that, meant it, and there's no reason to think it's not the case.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.500]   Now, here's the third one.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:22.900]   He calls himself not only a persecutor and a slanderer of Christ, but an insolent opponent.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.400]   Now, the word is in Greek hubristain, and you can hear in English the word hubris, right?
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.600]   Hubristain.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   Hubris.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   We get hubris from it.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.400]   Arrogance, haughtiness, pride.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.000]   This may be the key.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:49.400]   I think this is the key to understanding how literally Paul meant it when he said he was the foremost first of sinners.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.800]   To be a blasphemer or a slanderer, we can measure that by a person's words.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.200]   To be a persecutor, we can measure that by a person's actions.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:09.000]   But how do you measure proud insolence, haughty, arrogant insolence?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Only God could see this evil perfectly, and only Paul could feel it extensionally.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.100]   And Paul perhaps knew it and felt it more than all the rest of his sins.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:30.700]   On the Damascus Road, the words that Jesus used to convict Paul were, "Saul, Saul"—that
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:37.200]   was his Hebrew name—"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.800]   And he said, "Who are you, Lord?"
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.300]   And Jesus said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting."
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:50.800]   This put all of Paul's blasphemy, all of his persecution, all of his arrogance in a new light.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.000]   Now Paul had to measure his blasphemy and persecution and arrogance not by itself, but
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   in relation to the one he was sinning against—the risen, living Son of God.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.400]   And my guess is that this set Paul to thinking not just about the greatness of Christ as
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:19.100]   the one he was persecuting, but also about the privileges that he was sinning against.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.100]   Just think of it.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.600]   I think this is what stirred up the sense of the depth of his arrogance.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:31.700]   One, he was sinning against his own destiny because God had set him apart from his mother's
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.300]   womb to be an apostle.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.800]   Two, he was sinning against the greatest Bible knowledge of his time.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.500]   He was a Pharisee of Pharisees, he said in Philippians 3.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.200]   That is, he was a great Bible scholar.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.900]   He was sinning against all that knowledge.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   Third, he was sinning against the nearness, the historical nearness of the historical Jesus.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.600]   Paul was alive when Jesus, the Son of God, was on planet Earth.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.400]   He knew this was not myth.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.100]   Hundreds of eyewitnesses to the miracles and the words of Jesus existed.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.300]   Paul was sinning against great evidence.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.600]   Four, he was sinning against the beautiful love and mercy of martyrs.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.400]   Paul was there face to face with Stephen.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.360]   When he was stoned to death, they lay their garments at his feet, it says in the book
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   of Acts.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.500]   He heard Stephen say, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.800]   Lord, do not hold this sin against them."
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.360]   He saw that beautiful demonstration of Christlike mercy.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.480]   He was sinning against that.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:54.200]   So when Paul considered all that he was sinning against and that his blasphemy and his persecution
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   were in the face of all that truth and beauty, the insolence, the arrogance, the pride of
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:10.720]   his own heart was so terrible in his eyes that he pronounced himself the foremost.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.480]   And if we wonder, how could he know that no one was worse?
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.440]   How could he know that no one was worse?
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.920]   The ultimate answer, I think, is Jesus revealed this to him.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:40.000]   And this seems right, because this very firstness in sin was part of the inspired writing with
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.480]   which God intended to encourage others who despaired that they could never be saved,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   because they were that insolent, almost.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:58.520]   So it seems right that to say that God would see to it that Paul realized, felt this about
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   his own arrogant heart.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:09.480]   You, Paul, are the least deserving of my mercy, so I'm going to save you so that when you
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:17.960]   write 1 Timothy, no one will ever be able to say, "I am too undeserving."
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.360]   Absolutely humbling and hope-giving for all of us sinners.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.240]   Thank you for drawing those gospel reminders out for us from the life and testimony of
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   Paul.
