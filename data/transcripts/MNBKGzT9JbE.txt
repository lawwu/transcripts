[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.340]   like way back in the day um and i was actually supposed to be in a2f it's a little known thing i
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.340]   was supposed to be in a2f oh you were remember because you started recruiting me oh yeah from when
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.020]   i was like a junior in high school and i didn't know what these groups were so i was gonna join
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.900]   a2f and then choice of a life stuff happened another thing that i still haven't forgiven you
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.940]   for yeah because then we would have been together that would have been neat yeah because you were on
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.860]   a2f yeah yeah yeah yeah and then next year kairos and then that's when rick and i oh man and it was

[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.340]   form for like 12 years yeah except for like one semester so i'm gonna ask them to just tell us a
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.300]   little bit about themselves tell us a little about you guys for um for everyone listening so can you just
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.500]   start off with um your graduating class and your major and a little bit like a two sentence like
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.260]   your spiritual background and how you came to because we're a college ministry we do everything
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.460]   by graduating class yeah that's just how we do it so yeah mandatory questions how about pastor will yeah
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.060]   yeah sure yeah i'll start off um i graduated college in 1991 and i studied economics and after
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.860]   that i worked in um the consulting field for about 10 years um married to esther had two kids uh they're
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.740]   all grown up and so um yeah just really thankful for that my spiritual journey was um i grew up in
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.980]   a non-christian family but my dad became a christian when i was when i was 12 years old so it became we
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.660]   became a church going family after that um i accepted christ at my youth group in um with my family
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.540]   but then i slowly started to fall away because there were a lot of apologetics questions about
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.860]   science and faith that i just couldn't get answered yeah so i left that thinking okay i'll come back to
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.580]   religion later uh but for the time being just wanted to pursue just my dreams academic ambitions for
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.780]   about uh you know for the next 20 30 40 50 years and then when i'm getting ready i'll see god but um when i
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.780]   got to college i i had everything that i wanted but by the time i was a junior in college i started to
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.980]   ask those questions again why am i working so hard what's the purpose of life and that's when i met
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.180]   your dad isaiah and then um asked him a bunch of questions and uh started coming to our church
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.140]   the rest is history there's a funny story of like when you first came to our church and there's like
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.220]   people and people knew you yeah yeah so they're surprised this yeah yeah yeah wait wait oh yeah
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:42.540]   so i came junior right but i was a frat boy and i had you were a lambda no no i know i was a pineapple
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.020]   you're a pineapple yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so it's a little different full-on motorcycles well yeah yeah
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.580]   yeah yeah they're they're different and i have my opinions but you know okay that's for another podcast i
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.780]   suppose um i i i kind of developed a reputation about myself um in college as a frat boy and when
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.660]   i stepped foot into our church uh several of the sisters came up to me and said what are you doing
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.500]   oh my gosh i was like we're not secret friendly at that time we're not friendly to newcomers and then i
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.940]   just wanted to say um because of god yeah that's a good answer but but but but i knew where they were
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.580]   coming from and believe me i i totally deserved it okay wow yeah that's a lot of humility i actually
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.620]   experienced you when you were like just coming back i think we were freshmen and you're like a senior yeah
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:38.540]   yeah i didn't i didn't have a very favorable impression just letting you know yeah it was a long time ago
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.220]   it was a long time ago i want to hear more details about that i don't think we have time but okay so
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.980]   maybe rick just yeah your graduating class major and kind of your spiritual story yeah so i graduated in
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.140]   well my class in 94 when i actually graduated is another story but i studied cognitive science and i
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.340]   worked as a software engineer for 20 years before i went full-time and my spiritual background is i grew up
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.180]   in hawaii so i didn't go to church um my parents my family we had some run-ins with some christians
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.860]   so i really had a negative view and i just thought they were all like to be honest idiots okay because
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.020]   yeah it was bad anyway so i came in not looking for church came to college not looking for church but
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:35.100]   then um i from hawaii this pre-internet guys no internet back then and i had to find housing and so
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:42.460]   um i arranged for a room a boarding room at a frat and um when my parents went there to move me in they
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.820]   said oh my gosh this place was so filthy they said you're not gonna live here and so then i had to
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:57.500]   scramble long story short um i ended up getting contacted by our church who had a house full of
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.540]   guys and this is not in the house but uh they one of the guys moved out for you know he had a dorm
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.260]   contract so then he moved out and so the space opened up for me that is the only reason i'm here
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.660]   who did you know from our church or how did you get in contact well we met someone at the housing office
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.380]   when we were looking for housing and my mom being korean started to talk to anyone who's korean
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.660]   started asking them where do you live where do you how did you get your housing and then so they
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.820]   led us to the church and so we called and that's how yeah it was every moment it was on region
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.340]   yeah yeah i came over we played a lot of card games like as our times oh yeah yeah that kind of stuff
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.940]   wow yeah yeah we had we had a we had like six freshmen and a bunch of seniors oh okay cool okay so the
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.820]   reason we wanted to have you guys on today is because today's theme um of today's episode is
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.620]   uh what's changed about our church um we've been around um not necessarily as grace point but basically
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.500]   our church has been around for about 30 years yeah a little over 30 years now um and so obviously
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.180]   a lot is different um but you know we were only around well i was around since 1990 but i wasn't in
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.780]   college ministry until much later right so we wanted to get your guys perspective and basically what we want
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.980]   historical yeah historical prehistorical perspective so we want to get you what are for you guys what
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:28.220]   are the top three things that you are glad have changed about our church and could be serious could
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:34.300]   be just kind of random cosmetic things like whatever you want it to be well i'll start because i came in as
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:42.860]   a non-christian so first time at church you walk in and uh you know i just want to be inconspicuous just
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.100]   kind of attending whatever next thing you know is like they made all the newcomers stand up oh and start
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:56.140]   introducing yourself to the rest of the church so i'm glad we don't do that anymore yeah yeah what did they
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.100]   make you do they just say you just have to say your name and no you gotta stand up and then yeah yeah
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.220]   so everybody's seated and then the newcomers all stand up yeah and then one by one you just say like
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.220]   what's your name where what are you studying those typical questions and oh yeah and then they all clap
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.500]   for you i'm like okay thank you yeah it's kind of like let us welcome brother rick but then you weren't
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.900]   even a christian wait there was a no yeah yeah there was a total oh yeah yeah i don't think they
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.940]   sang for me but i i heard that before my time oh that was even before your time yeah that that was
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.700]   before my time no yeah yeah when i came uh first thing was to your dad's bible study okay so i came in
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:39.100]   and this i mean i mean you were in your mother's womb and then um yeah i came in to say hey you know hey
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.620]   we have a newcomer here his name is william and let's let's welcome him and uniformly they all you're
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.220]   standing yeah yeah i'm standing and on cue i don't know how they started singing this song
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.100]   that is welcome brother will let us and i forgot how it goes but i remember standing there feeling
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.900]   wow this is really awkward i'm a frat guy right i'm coming in and i'm not i'm not used to listening to
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:08.380]   that kind of music you know other type of music right yeah uh but uh it was weird but um i i came
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.740]   because i was hungry for god's word wow and um i loved hearing your dad you were like push through this
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.780]   yeah so it was well it was worth it it was it was worth it pushing through all of that just to hear
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.980]   the word when did we stop doing that when did we stop doing the song because i i don't remember that
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.180]   yeah yeah i think it must have been before you guys so sometime in between yeah yeah okay
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.900]   three years yeah but even afterwards we were still welcoming people yeah i remember the standing
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.860]   because i remember i brought some friends during high school and then we try to make it a little less
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.260]   awkward by having their friends stand up with them oh yeah yeah yeah i remember but then it was really
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.100]   awkward for the person introducing them too so i had to do that for this guy that i had literally just
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.980]   met like a week before that was that was rough and then i forgot i don't want him i don't want to invite
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.900]   anyone to church again yeah it was very while we're on the topic like anything else around those
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.860]   gatherings and services well yeah because well okay so that's a front end so you when you're a newcomer you
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.700]   come into our church you're getting sung to right and then toward the end of service there was this
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.140]   weird thing in which um uh the pastor would say his closing prayer and then he'd have us all stand and
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:22.140]   then like on mass like everyone knew what to do they all reached down they started holding each other's
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:28.860]   hands i'm like whoa this is kind of weird right because um you know you do that and then the guy next
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.900]   to you could have really clammy hands and after you come start coming to our church for a while you
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:40.300]   know who they are yeah you don't want to sit next to them at the beginning of service knowing what's
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.340]   coming at the end oh man right and what really made it awkward was sometimes you know you know you do that
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:52.060]   with um with you know with girls too and and i'm like whoa you know um this is kind of weird and
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:58.780]   like okay i get it but sometimes you know um you know a girl comes by and kind of like her and you
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.660]   didn't mind and you know at the beginning if you sit down and you think strategically you kind of like
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.980]   okay well you know what's coming up yeah yeah that's kind of hard to focus on the message and everything
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:16.380]   yeah yeah exactly exactly and then that's ideal right yeah hold hands and um yeah and yeah just
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.700]   is that why they stopped them yeah well i don't know when we stopped that either but it's like stuff
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:30.060]   like that happened because of tradition until someone was bold enough to say hey why are we doing this
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:37.100]   and then we're all like yeah why are we doing this and then we just stop are the is that a korean thing
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.900]   the holding the hands and is that or yeah i don't know because i went to a korean church in high
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.540]   school and i don't remember doing that okay so i think it was just kind of i didn't do that yeah
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.740]   thank the lord we used to do foot washing too we did yeah yeah i've heard of that i didn't know our
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:57.900]   church did that yeah yeah it was a tradition every new year's eve you did that yeah it happened like twice
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:03.340]   like it was like pretty pretty special occasions though yeah and so literally you just yeah so um new
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.020]   year's eve you came and you came with your own bucket so you had to bring you bring your own
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:14.140]   book yeah yeah b-y-o yeah bring your own b-y-o-b means something different and then um and then you
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.860]   know there would be a message and then it's about you know foot washing yeah john 13. yeah in light of
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:24.300]   what jesus said right we got to serve and love and everything and um i remember when we did that um
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:33.340]   your dad would magically disappear yeah yeah he hates stuff like that yeah he hates stuff like that
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.220]   so we're all doing it and i'm like wait where's where's ed because i just knew him as ed back then
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:44.140]   because he was just a lawyer um but then he would somehow find like some technical issue or some sound
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:50.620]   and go to the bathroom or something that was really oh i did i actually did not know we did that kind
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.380]   of disgusting oh gosh but you don't remember that no and how did they we probably i'm thankful so you
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:04.940]   were the cusp of a new generation yeah how can you oh anyways you know okay so so come to think of it um
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:12.220]   your dad he went to he went to boston to planet church right right and then when he came back
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.860]   that's when he took over the college ministry right and i think that's when he started to
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.380]   change stop a lot of those yeah yeah stop a lot of the things that okay they were kind of nice
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:28.300]   back in the day i suppose but then we started to ask where he started to ask hey why are we doing this
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.100]   let's yeah if there wasn't a good reason that i can praise the lord i'm very thankful i don't think i
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.780]   would have stayed at our church if we had to it's just one of those things i think yeah yeah
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.260]   wow just just mentally i can't even imagine how how did they pair you up for the foot washing
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:49.260]   um you have a morbid fascination with this whole topic yeah yeah you just go to the person that you
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:55.820]   want to yeah and so that makes it worse i think no no yeah it was worse but then here's the thing like
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:01.900]   you're thinking okay well i gotta submit to this and i gotta humble myself and i have to love like jesus
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.420]   yeah love someone like jesus did and for me it was like okay who do i have a tough time loving
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:13.900]   it was my my roommate wow and so i'd have to come to him and he come to me there's something powerful
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:20.940]   about that there is there is so it's a it's a practical way to love your brother humble yourself
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:31.180]   and humble yourself um but then maybe not the most hygienic yeah or newcomer friendly yeah or or newcomer
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:37.260]   friendly but um but yeah i i think it was helpful but yeah i think there are other ways to to humble
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:44.780]   yourself yeah like saying sorry or exactly other things exactly wow okay okay gosh all right well
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.740]   thank you for that okay so we have the we have the weird welcoming tradition we got the holding
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.940]   hands and praying we got the foot washing yeah um were there other things that come to mind what
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:01.100]   else yeah well i think for me um i think one thing that's definitely changed is the segregation between the genders
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:07.820]   yeah because um when i came like it was like on one side of the church with all the brothers and
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:13.020]   on the other side the sisters except when the holding of hands yeah anyways but that's kind of
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.660]   it's in the aisle yeah but when it came to like fellowship time it's pretty much the guys gathered
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:24.620]   and the girls gathered and um i i i spotted that immediately and i knew it was different it wasn't
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:31.500]   something that i experienced at my church growing up uh but then i i kind of appreciated that because um
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:40.140]   there was a kind of a um a reverence or or or respect uh for the other gender and it gave time for
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:47.180]   relationships uh between between peers of same genders to form and me coming from a fraternity
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:53.260]   background you know coming in like i i loved it because i could just focus on god right i don't
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:59.740]   i don't have to worry about the game the drama the game the potential marketplace type values and stuff
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:06.060]   like that uh so i i i definitely appreciated that yeah you know honestly in the back of my mind i'm like
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:13.740]   i don't know that's changed i mean it depends on which church well i think during our undergrad days
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.940]   or maybe a little after there was a shift definitely the um segregated seating not that it was ever like
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.700]   a rule but that i remember that did happen yeah but there was a conscious effort like we gotta yeah
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.100]   and then we said okay this is weird guys let's start integrating the seating please and then it would
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.620]   be like one row of brothers on the sister side yeah yeah and then but over time i think that has that
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.900]   aspect at least has gotten better but you know coming from a non-christian perspective i had no
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.780]   preconceived notion of what church was supposed to be like i just thought it's holy it's like this place
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:51.340]   where you come to you know meet god or whatever so when i first came surprisingly i didn't have a lot
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:57.580]   of besides the cringy holding hands washing feet stuff like um like in terms of like church i just
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:03.100]   thought like okay this supposed to be a holy somber kind of place maybe you know you can't you know so
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.340]   you kind of expected yeah i kind of expected a lot but then you know getting to know a lot of my
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:13.580]   friends who grew up in church and went to church i mean i can tell like they had different issues with
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:18.620]   like a lot of different things and it was all new to me so i was just like oh what how come they have so
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:24.300]   many problems yeah it's become with some notions of what you yeah so for me i mean like segregation
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.100]   all of that's like oh okay well i guess you know this is supposed to be like this at church you know
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:34.540]   you're supposed to focus on god some stuff didn't change yeah no so i mean yeah so i had a lot of
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:41.260]   those kind of issues like i'm new to church but then it's the church guys who had a lot of different
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:48.300]   things so that is interesting yeah yeah well now now i i think i know why guys still congregate with
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.660]   guys and girls girls it's because i just like talking to guys we can talk about guy things like
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.940]   sports or you know marvel or whatever and um and i just girls play sports and yeah yeah yeah
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:05.980]   yeah but man it's just like you know getting together with yeah you know so yeah i get that
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:12.700]   yeah yeah it it has changed though i think there is more integration i think um uh but yeah it wasn't
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.900]   yeah it was really bad back it was bad i agree yeah well rick i mean was there anything that like
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.940]   you did have issue with like you know it's all new but like you know you're just kind of like yeah i mean
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:31.500]   well the first thing that comes to mind uh back when um i was a freshman is okay you know i'm i'm from
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:40.140]   hawaii yeah i made that clear uh i'm used to going to the beach and you know like just that kind of stuff
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:45.820]   so our church we had our like a rafting trip it was really fun you know it's splashing water and everybody
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:51.340]   everybody gets wet there's not no one should be dry after rafting and so we're all wet and then you
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:57.820]   know we have a picnic after and with food and so after uh the rafting my shirt everything is wet so
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.220]   i'm like oh man i gotta take this off so i took it off and i got in line for food because it was normal
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.860]   for you growing up yeah it's like it's a wet shirt why have your shirt on why why are you wearing a wet
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:12.700]   shirt right and then i got a tap on my shoulder saying um can you please put on your shirt i was like
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:25.900]   what my shirt's wet and like i know i'm like okay this is weird church yeah so i had to go put on the
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.820]   wet shirt and it was like you know nasty feeling yeah putting back the wet shirt yeah so and it was a little
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.740]   embarrassing that's a little because you got called out because i got called out in line i'm like in
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.540]   line getting food and they're like go put on your shirt i'm like oh what the i'm surprised you came
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:49.020]   back yeah yeah so yeah yeah that was that was a little shocking and like oh yeah this church it's a
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:56.940]   little uptight yeah they were uptight about the whole skin thing you know that is a weird thing like still to
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:02.220]   this day i remember in undergrad i had a friend from another church at berkeley who was like dude i
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:09.340]   heard i heard grace pointers aren't allowed to go to the beach i was like uh that's not true but it is
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.660]   true that when we go to the beach everyone keeps their shirt on so that is yeah that's a little weird
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:19.340]   thing about us but you know it's because we are kind of well it's interesting i never encountered that
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:25.340]   problem because like when i went to the norcal beaches i was like it's cold you know i love going to
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.060]   the beach i love doing like you know same thing but in norcal i was like okay hypothermia yeah it's like
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:37.420]   55 years here it came up a little bit you know but but yeah it is yeah i mean you know the issues
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:42.780]   whoever called you out was probably one in guard a culture of modesty and and just you know but
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:48.460]   it's weird yeah and for the record like put on a wet shirt for the record our church we don't have
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.980]   an official stance on wearing your shirt at the beach just want to throw that out there i mean my wife's
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.980]   still a little mad about she's she's kind of she's kind of one of these hyper conservatives i think
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.980]   but we went to tahoe one time and you know some freshman guys sophomore guys to say can we take our
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.260]   shirts off i say go for it man and um we still haven't come to an agreement about that one me and my
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:15.020]   wife but yeah my point is that it varies leader yeah and it does vary the leader yeah yeah freshmen at
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:20.460]   tahoe that reminds me of the there was a time later on so after all of this i'm thinking like everybody
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.820]   needs to keep the shirt on and we were out there with some freshmen for an outing and your parents
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:31.660]   like when you were a staff our staff your parents were there with us and then all the freshman guys
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:38.460]   took off the shirt and they're like running around and i was like oh man and the first thing i did was
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.220]   look at your dad's reaction i was like what is he gonna say and he was totally cool is it on flicker
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:51.660]   no but i'm thinking like i had to put my shirt on you know these guys are running around without their
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:57.580]   shirt wow wow yeah you know well i'm from so count so i went to the beach um and uh totally used to you
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:03.020]   know going to the beach and then you swear bathing suit and everything and um i i remember that that
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.980]   rafting trip oh you remember yeah yeah well i you know i was on a raft we're a raft full of guys and
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.980]   it was so hot i just took my shirt off you know what else are you gonna do wait wait you mean the
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.860]   one where he took his shirt off and he got called out yeah yeah yeah but but then that was at the picnic
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.860]   where there were other people you know just brothers and sisters just everywhere so you put on a
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.740]   yeah i i was on a raft full of guys right there weren't any leaders around
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.260]   i mean of course of course when there's a raft of sisters you know we're just doing this well
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.100]   i mean even if the sister wanted to call you out they can't because they're on the ground
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:43.740]   so um yeah so i i think i think if someone called me out like that i would have been like what's up
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.460]   because you were still kind of new to our church too yeah yeah i was still kind of new i was a frat guy
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:56.140]   just unrefined so it seems like it's like it's not just like it's it wasn't the shirt off it's it's the
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.860]   uptightness yeah yeah yeah it's the uptightness and like you know what's the that might be the
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:07.020]   why what is that well what what's so tight or you know what's the heart everyone does allergic yeah
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.780]   yeah and so it's it's things like that that um okay well i realized okay our church is like this
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:20.060]   but i'm willing to roll with it because i love i love our church in the sense that i love how i can get
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.980]   god's word everyone's living it out right and there's a sense of holiness and i knew i had to be
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:33.900]   there and um stuff like that it was just a small price to play uh play pay okay so i so i rolled
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:40.780]   with it but then now like 10 20 years out i can look back at that and see the wisdom behind you know
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.860]   some of that because you know we don't want to draw attention to ourselves yeah yeah we don't want to
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:51.020]   stumble others and all that kind of stuff on on that word stumble i heard a really funny story so stumble
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.860]   for people who don't know it's like you know tempting people or like you know yeah yeah you
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.820]   look really attractive whatever right and there's a story of a uh a guy the guy's playing ball and
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.340]   like everyone's there playing yeah and then um and then uh one of the guys is like wearing a cut off
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.260]   tee you know just just no sleeves right and just playing and then one of the person can you go talk
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.860]   to that guy and the guy that i heard the story from he had a quote he went up to go call the guys hey
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.260]   man can you like change your shirt i was like why and he goes oh because you know it's kind of like
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:22.060]   stumbling you know the guy goes people are stumbled by this like yeah never mind you're good
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.260]   i won't cut off t play basketball i never got called i don't know why i just know some of the
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:35.740]   people so i remember when i was a youth pastor yeah i took a bunch of high school high high school guys
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.860]   to zion right which included isaiah's brother noah yeah that's hey let's take our shirts off because
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:46.220]   it was hot yeah so we took it off and we took like these pictures i didn't make it a flicker i mean
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:52.700]   yeah it's not it's on my hard drive so yeah to this day yeah yeah to this day yeah i have it and
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.740]   you know john vang's there we all know john oh yeah and then he's like yeah and i can see yeah it could
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:04.540]   he's done depends on who yeah it depends it varies from person to person you i mean he's you can wear a
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:14.700]   shirt you yeah yeah no i got you but i do feel like yeah i i do feel like for sure we we've improved
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.140]   on this as a church maybe some work to do still but like i do feel like back in the day
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.020]   we kind of expected like non-christians to act like christians a little bit there was a little
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:29.260]   bit of that going on and uh kind of just not overzealous yeah yeah so then now we're like okay
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.020]   and maybe like it was also you know you're trying to build a culture too because you're a little more
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:39.260]   hyper vigilant as well so yeah it's like actors too but yeah yeah okay do you guys have any more for
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:44.540]   us we want to move on to one more topic before we end the show here today okay so we wanted to
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.060]   talk about now some like more recent stuff so that's like that's kind of ancient history for
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.860]   most of our listeners they were not around maybe not even born
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:56.780]   describing now that i think about it um so we want to talk a little bit about some of the more like
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:02.700]   recent changes like and i'm talking within like the past five ten years um so um what are maybe if
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.180]   we just i think just throw these out here as a group um we don't really have a system for this but
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.700]   like what are some of like the significant changes that we've made recently and maybe just your thoughts on that
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.500]   um you kind of your reaction and kind of if you thought that was a good or a bad thing and and
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:23.820]   that so so like i think one thing that stood out to me and this is pretty recent um so i can start us
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:29.500]   off is the whole sabbath week phenomenon and i think that started like a two years ago year ago
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.140]   year ago i think about a year it started when you guys went out to philly is that was that the first time
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:41.020]   we yeah yeah yeah so um i mean i think that's like a big thing that i don't know how that even would
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:46.780]   have come across to your generation when you were our age that might have been like i don't know but
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:52.460]   it would have kind of been unheard of but basically now once a week as a church we try to build a week
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.980]   where we don't really do like the regular rhythms of ministries so we basically say nothing that requires
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:03.500]   a meeting or like a planning doc you know um we like spend a night for soul care spend a night just
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.820]   building relationships and hanging out with people spend a night just hanging out with your fellowship
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:14.460]   in like an unstructured way um and personally i think it's been really good for us it kind of forces
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:20.300]   us to slow down gives us a breather uh kind of helps our staff to just sort of come back again to
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:26.860]   like why am i doing this and and connect to jesus again good reset point yeah um so i think that is
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.820]   to me one of the biggest changes that we've made in a very recent one but i think it's helped to kind
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:37.820]   of offset a lot of um i think just some of the difficulty of doing ministry um where it can feel
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:44.060]   relentless and it can feel at times like um yeah like we don't make times to just connect you know we
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.300]   don't make times to just like grow in our relationships because we're just doing doing doing so
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.980]   to me that would be one of my top ones what do you guys how do you guys feel about like like what do
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.660]   you guys think about that change about that i think it's really good because back in the day
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:01.900]   oh man i think well i i can't speak for other people but this is my sentiment that other people
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:07.740]   thought this way like for me i prided myself on doing a lot of work like i was a business guy i wanted
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:12.300]   to go to wall street you know they work like crazy are you a type three pastor yeah no actually i'm a type
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:21.900]   seven yeah yeah so i'm not i'm just kind of confused enneagramically yeah but anyways um like
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.780]   when i heard okay michael milken right he's a wall street guy you guys don't know he worked like 80 to
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:31.900]   100 hours left four hours and i thought man if he's gonna do that for money i gotta do that for the lord
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:37.420]   yeah and so i'm i'm gonna be like okay well let's work let's do this um no one forced me to but that
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:43.900]   was kind of like my work ethic and that's a sense that i got from the oldies back then but looking back
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.220]   now that i'm older yeah i could i'd be like oh yeah i think that was a little too unhealthy
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.740]   i mean no one was forcing us to do all of that but then that was kind of the culture so i'm really
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.620]   glad to see that things have changed that we're taking this monthly sabbath and i praise god for that
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.860]   yeah and i'm thankful just because like with a lot of church planting and stuff like that like just
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.620]   a lot of the relationships have gone disrupted we feel thinner yeah we feel a little thinner because
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.940]   we've just been i mean you plant a shirt like you send people out to plant church it disrupts a lot
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.300]   relationally i think maybe part of the reason why we were able to run so hard before was like
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.540]   everyone was together and that there's a lot of relationship right and our church because of church
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:23.820]   planting which is praise god for um there is that cost of relationships thinning right and so like
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:30.300]   trying to build in um at times so yeah i'm trying not to laugh because i as soon as i said we feel
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:36.140]   thinner i knew that some people are gonna make comments about that so i already know i'm like
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:43.100]   why are you smiling okay can i can i get one yeah yeah yeah um i think one of the things that i felt
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:48.620]   like changed the most since i was a freshman is sort of how open we are to other churches yeah and like
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.700]   for me that's the biggest one actually really because because i like we were always connected
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.980]   so one of the reasons why i stayed at our church and i was really interested because i remember meeting
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.140]   you and you're telling me how pastor is like really good friends with jp moreland yeah and jp moreland
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.300]   is one of my heroes in high school oh yeah yeah he's being your vineyard vineyard he was vineyard and then
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.540]   like my my mentor was getting me into apologetics and then i was like this church is apologetics and
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.580]   so i was like blown away so like i was blown away by how many people were connected to whether it was like yeah um
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.780]   jp moreland josh mcdowell sean mcdowell like william mccraig some of these guys so we've always been
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.540]   connected but we've always been under the radar because we don't want to attract attention to
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.860]   ourselves we just want to like be faithful right but now it's like i mean set network college
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:33.180]   collaborate like just i can name so many things where i'm really open and so i just want to get your
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:38.780]   guys's thoughts on on that like i mean have some thoughts but my thoughts on that yeah just like do you
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:44.700]   see that as as a change that's happened and yeah yeah i think so i think we're very i mean i think
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:51.820]   we thought of ourselves as like very small you know and um we're just kind of doing our own thing yeah
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:57.020]   and it was just when we first started it was just berkeley right so it's like we never thought of
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.500]   ourselves as anything more than that and then um never thought about like this becoming a net like a
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.540]   nation yeah no and then i think for me it was i mean like getting guest speakers and things like that
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.820]   it was always cool because like you know you could name drop people or something like oh so and so was
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:19.900]   at our church but um still i i think the thing that really got my eyes open a little bit was collaborative
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:28.220]   and it was these other people who kind of visited our church other college ministries yeah they're
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:33.900]   looking at college ministries and they saw something and they wanted to sort of make a big deal out of it
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:43.020]   by having a conference and like having us share our story and how we're doing things and um and honestly
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.620]   like i said this is the theme i i was in church so this is the only church that i've known yeah right
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:55.260]   and so kind of seeing other churches and hearing from them and kind of their challenges and what they're
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:02.460]   going through and then their willingness or wanting to learn like what how we do things and what what
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:08.620]   we're doing i was just like wow that was that was kind of eye-opening for me yeah it's like oh it's not
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:16.140]   like this everywhere else you know it's there's it's very different and we have something that maybe they're
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:21.980]   interested in yeah yeah yeah so for those of you don't know college collaborative um it's a conference
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:27.980]   of collegiate church planting churches and we gathered so yeah share knowledge yeah and it's
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.660]   getting inspired by each other commission board yeah and there was a guy there who was like really trying
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.820]   to get a lot of these college missions together to share knowledge and just like you know build a
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.380]   movement basically of like collegiate focused church planting was really cool um eventually it just kind
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.620]   of stopped it coven and stuff yeah coven and things like that and just um um no one to like really
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.380]   organize that but um but we're still connected to those churches i think we've learned a lot super from
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.300]   them and as much as they've learned from us too and some of those guys they still text here and there
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.260]   oh yeah what's going on yeah i mean we we still keep in touch with all of them steal their ideas oh yeah
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:02.700]   they have a lot of good things that we're trying to incorporate yeah yeah you know and and vice versa i
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.860]   guess and so it's been good in that way yeah and so to that end like i think like once we
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.980]   appreciated what we had i mean i came in because you know from other children wow this is amazing
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.540]   right but just being able to see now us kind of opening and and seeing like wow god's given
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.980]   something really special precious and we want to bless other people with it and i mean for me like
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.220]   even just like doing inner high which is where we go out to other you know ethnic under-resourced churches
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.860]   and do like youth service for them because all these youth don't have their own service their own
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.780]   language like i came from a church like that and so like when we started that passover when you started
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:39.580]   like and i was part of that niche you know like in 2010 2009 and um that was just like i was so
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:45.020]   thankful for that and and it's my favorite ministry yeah yeah it's my favorite ministry and i just just
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:50.460]   because that's where i grew up and and i know how hard it was and i think that's also showed people
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.500]   like it's not it's really not about us yeah it's it's just we want to see the kingdom of god expand right
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.380]   and i think it's blessed a lot of people yeah and so that's what i mean even now like your dad you
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.500]   know we got in touch with him and he's connecting us in socal yeah yeah with like all of these other
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.380]   churches i did youth retreats for his home church and stuff so yeah so i mean it's been a blessing for
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:16.620]   us because like we get to go out there and like you know for some people who it just reignites their
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.940]   heart for yeah youth ministry this is tough for them yeah like they're like doing it on their own
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:26.620]   it's not like us yeah and they're so appreciative of like even anything that we do for them so yeah
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.780]   and i think uh just the the whole aspect of like partnering with kind of other campus ministries too
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.900]   i think we were i kind of think this was a weakness of ours back in the day where we kind of not that
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:43.500]   we weren't open to that but we didn't prioritize that yeah kind of just did our own thing um for whatever
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.820]   reasons and i think that's the way we've grown too just like being more open to that more friendly
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.620]   honestly like hey we're here let's meet let's talk so i think for us uh year one church plan is doing
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:57.820]   that in philly like meeting the local nam and send guys has been a huge blessing shout out to you know
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.100]   like stan williams and kyle kanti and these guys yeah brian messer and then just like the other christian
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:08.140]   groups on campus so like you know we we do a lot with like fca at the penn campus and i think i don't
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.860]   know i just think that didn't occur to us before but super thankful just that we're kind of doing more
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.340]   of that and getting involved in that way so yeah yeah um yeah any others any others you guys want
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.860]   to throw out there like kind of changes that we made in the reason yeah i think um one thing that
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:28.380]   i've seen change a lot is just the amount of uh input that um that we're getting and asking for uh because
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:35.660]   back in the day and maybe this is because i was very low on the totem pole not high up but it always seems
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:41.900]   that the the the that the leadership like they went up to a mountain right and then god spoke to them
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:47.340]   yeah and then they came down and like thus saith the lord this is what we're going to do at a church and
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:55.020]   then we're like okay let's roll yeah and then there wasn't any input or any opportunity or as much to give
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:01.820]   feedback or to like um ask questions about about okay you know can we get more clarification but now
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:07.740]   things are like so different um and because i know it's a reflection of like your dad and your mom
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.780]   i say that because they're they're hungry for data right i mean data is really important they need
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:18.780]   more information and it's important that uh we especially you know when when the overseers make
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.300]   decisions about our church uh that we get input from everyone not just amongst ourselves but from
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:31.100]   uh the leads the full-time leads the uh the campus leads even from staff and students even yeah and
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.980]   we're we're regularly polling you know through like google forms hey what do you think about this can
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:42.140]   we get your feedback on this i've seen um you know there's there's that anonymous email channel that
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:49.500]   that that that that pastor red put up and um anyone can could could write into that um as well as that vine or
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.060]   combo that we have as well yeah just kind of internal yeah and i've seen and i've seen like pastor and
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.660]   kelly they're they're regularly talking to people outside of our church to get uh some input or some
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:05.340]   feedback about us about you know uh what decisions or directions that we need to go and so that has
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:11.180]   definitely changed a lot yeah i mean dramatically i mean to add to that is the q a times that we have with
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:17.740]   them too i mean they have so many almost after for for a season last semester i remember even with the
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.940]   college students right i mean we would have a q a times and they'd ask every yeah we did q a at philly
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:28.940]   too yeah from from from the actual message to just about our church and everything so i think yeah that
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:33.740]   that's been a really positive change i feel like i had a related one um just kind of getting like people
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.860]   involved younger um so like getting our students involved in more things getting them to help like plan
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.100]   things yeah because we used to be a little shaolin temple yeah i appreciated that shaolin temple but
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.460]   then i think if i if i wasn't burnt out coming as a freshman i'd be like this just don't let me do
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:52.380]   anything like that's why i thought you were going to leave i was like i just need to do nothing yeah
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.780]   i remember that yeah we're lucky but yeah no because i think back in the day it was sort of like you have
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:01.260]   to like you don't have to quite be jesus but you have to kind of be like almost apostle paul if you're
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:06.780]   going to serve in any capacity in our church that was sort of our mentality um so we've chilled out on that a
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.540]   little bit uh so i'm thankful for that because i think i think we benefited from that and people
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:16.620]   grow faster as a result yeah yeah i just want to say like as a maybe it's wrapped that one up it's
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.540]   that's a challenge for like every organization to to get that kind of what is happening on the ground
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.420]   that kind of and feedback can do that well and um we we have our challenges and things like that
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.340]   but i do think it's something we continue to grow and just creating that space for that to happen
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:34.780]   in a really constructive way so i'm thankful for that too yeah yeah well i think we are almost out
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:39.340]   of time here so i'm going to just rattle off a couple other things that i think are important that
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.420]   they've changed and then feel free to throw some out more but uh i think it's significant that we don't
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.220]   turn in wrs anymore that's something we just need reflections weekly reflections we don't we still do
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.140]   them but we don't turn them in and that was just it was just one of those things that a lot of
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.900]   people just felt weird about and i think just given sort of some cultural shifts that we were
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.700]   maybe a little slow to recognize we figured okay it's best to not do that anymore well i mean a certain
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.980]   level of leadership we still do just because like among that that's right it's like yeah you know
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:11.180]   that's that is part of our full-time it's just needed yeah and to be honest i hate sitting down to
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:17.820]   write it i hate it it's the pastor of our church everybody pastor of our church overseer every week i'm like
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:24.700]   why okay so but then i just obey yeah and then at the end of an hour and a half two hours i'm feeling
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:29.100]   like oh man i'm really glad i did yeah yeah i'm so glad i did that so there's something really about
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:35.340]   yeah yeah yeah i mean exactly so there's so much that happens you know and i think for me like just
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:41.020]   sitting down makes you kind of think like okay my memory is going so i have to kind of sit down
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:47.020]   and and kind of go okay what happened last week yeah yeah we live like a month and a week yeah yeah
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:52.540]   because if i don't do that then i'm just back in the saddle i'm going you know 60 70 80 miles per
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:58.540]   hour and it's another week of just going strong yeah without getting that oh man i'm really thankful
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.860]   how god worked in my life kind of moment i mean i think that would be dangerous i'm really thankful
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.900]   for wr although i still hate it i'm gonna hate it wait what day is it today i don't know it's a
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:13.260]   thursday thursday yeah i'm gonna hate it monday i'll be thankful monday after yeah yeah but i do think
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.820]   some of the changes have made like you know that structure is good but then also now okay i don't
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.380]   have that structure so how do i continue to keep up with like and keep in and stay in touch with the
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:27.420]   people and get connected what's going on their life for me it's made me try like recognizing the weakness
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.300]   and me being like relational that way and so it's forced me to grow in that way too so it's you emphasize
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.740]   different things in different seasons right yeah sure so yeah yeah yeah all right i think that's all i had
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.460]   actually yeah do you have any last ones to add um any ones to throw out i do have one last one
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.220]   it might be a little bit long a little bit this one is just one that i feel but like um
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:51.420]   i feel like it's important to bring up though because i do think like how we approach um family
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.300]   like like parents you know okay because you know in college that time where you're becoming more
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.460]   independent you're gonna become an adult and so there's that natural separation from parents and
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.620]   stuff like that and like i remember in undergrad hearing a lot of testimonies about people like
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:10.460]   going like wow like i need to stay to grow spiritually right and if i go back home where
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.980]   there's no church there's no like community whatever like that'll be like spiritually really
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.060]   difficult and so a lot of testimonies i heard were like that which is sort of like man even though it
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:22.780]   really disappointed my parents like i wanted to stay you know and and um i i had it easy out because
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.260]   my parents kicked me out of the house they're like go leave so castle when they asked me i want to come
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.060]   back i was like no you kicked me out you know it was still hard though for them but like
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:37.340]   now a lot of the testaments i hear is like he's good with his parents by the way yeah they come
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:42.780]   over all the time so thankful for them yeah but um but just like yeah like now it's a lot of like how
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:47.260]   do we love our parents together i think part of that has to do with our church's aging right and so
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:51.500]   like yeah even just a couple weeks ago i told my mom like she was over helping me watch my kid and
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.780]   i was like mom you know i get sick and old you're gonna stay with me you know and she was it doesn't
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.260]   matter how busy i am like you can stay with me right and that i feel like that's a shift is that right
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:07.020]   would you guys agree and or is that kind of what what your parents just that the the kind of testimonies
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:13.260]   or just that i mean i know your mom my mom yeah that's true with me since yeah since 2000 that's true
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:21.340]   so um yeah that's yeah but i think as as we get older yeah right i think we realize um i mean for
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:26.700]   my family i mean they're not christian but then because of my commitments they sort of you know
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:34.460]   moved out of hawaii came here my mom moved in with me and then um from there she started coming out to
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:40.220]   our church the korean department and then um she became a christian through that so so there was
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:45.100]   that blessing and then you know what else is she gonna do with her life so she spent a lot of time
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:52.140]   babysitting you know raising she she watched our yeah yeah i mean she has like a long list of all the
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.180]   kids some of them are in college now but you know that that she's watched and so she got really
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:04.300]   connected and i i imagine like if it wasn't for that i think she would have been um pretty lonely
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.100]   and isolated because like growing up we didn't have like a lot of friends outside of our immediate
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.180]   family yeah because we're so busy so yeah so i feel like i'm hearing more and more stories like
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.500]   that and maybe it's just age where it's like becoming a blessing to our family yeah right yeah i think
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.980]   what we got better at or more aware of is that oh you know we really need to disciple people in
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.580]   this area i think before we would kind of assume that people were taking care of people knew how
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:31.180]   to like children like birthdays yeah as leadership we realize oh people are not doing that and they're
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.260]   not good at that a lot of times and so i was i was terrible yeah it's like we need to push people to
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.020]   actually love their families and i don't know i think maybe some of us thought that was sort of a
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:45.980]   given but realizing oh so bad yeah we gotta help people do that yeah yeah i think um i think definitely
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   there has been an increase in uh in gaining wisdom right about how to love your parents because boy you
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:59.580]   know i i know that um i've said stuff like hey you gotta call your parents more hey why don't you go
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:05.420]   spend time with your parents because of you know for various reasons and depending upon the person yeah
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:11.500]   you have to spend more time or pay more attention to your parents but then there might be another person
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:17.100]   who might be a little bit too attached to their parents maybe emotionally and even financially but
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:23.260]   then the grown adults and maybe for the sake of like that person's marriage you know just you know
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:28.940]   just a little bit more independence you know healthier independence is better and so you could speak into
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:34.620]   that a little bit but then so i i'd like to say just wisdom with regard to parents how to best i like
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:41.020]   love your parents because it might be pulling back it might be moving toward yeah yeah it's it's really
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:47.580]   difficult yeah it's really difficult yeah it's hard to navigate yeah yeah yeah yeah wow okay i think
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.460]   we got to wrap up but i want to thank you guys so much for joining us today our first guests yeah our
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:58.460]   podcast all right she does more often this is great yeah we should then we have to talk less but i i think
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:04.060]   just to kind of wrap up final final thought here i i do think like the point of today is not to be like
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:08.780]   oh pat ourselves on the back look we figured it all out like i think totally as a church we're still
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:13.500]   figuring things out you know there's still room to grow but like we're not the same people that we were
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.660]   10 years ago we're not the same church we were 10 years ago and i think it's appropriate to to take
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:23.100]   note of that and to and and to have that help us like think through like yeah how can we continue to
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.820]   change and grow and just be the best church we can be you know and that's our goal so um yeah i just wanted to end
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:33.820]   with that note in case it came off that way i guess for our listeners so yeah yeah yeah so if
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.860]   anything we said today helped other churches out there or yeah even just like yeah with even within
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:45.820]   our church you know grow and stuff and thankful for it so yeah so um like and subscribe i gotta say
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:55.820]   that every week and we will see you guys next time yeah let's do this again maybe at the beach
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:01.500]   you know
