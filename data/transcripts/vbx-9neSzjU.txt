[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.720]   James from Auckland, New Zealand asks, "Pastor John, how does God's predestining
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:20.520]   people to eternal hell bring himself glory?" Well, before we embrace the term
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920]   "predestining to hell," we need to make some qualifications, because the very
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.560]   statement is one that is very rare, if present, in the Bible in those terms. I
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.280]   could think of one or two texts that could almost be paraphrased that way, so
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.120]   I don't want to be too hard on the question, but here are the
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.480]   qualifications I want to put on the phrase before I give the answer that I
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   see. There will be no one in hell who does not deserve to be there. No one will
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.160]   be there who can give a good reason, a warranted reason, why they
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.280]   shouldn't be there. And all of the world will know this and will vindicate God in
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.080]   it. There will be no doubting of the justice of God at the last day. That's
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.520]   the first thing that has to be said biblically, is that no one will be in
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.640]   hell who doesn't deserve to be there. Second, no one will be in hell who's not
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.280]   in a state of rebellion against God. If we have any sense, people are being
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.440]   thrown there who are not in rebellion against God, but they're lovers of God,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.240]   or they're repenting toward God, or they're embracing God, or they're
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   somehow not in rebellion against God, that's just a foreign concept to the
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.200]   Bible. The only people who will suffer are people who've been opposing God and
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.360]   are at the present moment in hell opposing God, rejecting God. And the third
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.400]   thing that needs to be said to qualify that phrase "predestined to hell" is, in
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   election and predestination, I think the Bible portrays God as choosing graciously
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:30.480]   to save some sinners, not choosing to make some really good people bad. It
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.960]   always pictures Him as rescuing sinners before the foundation of the world.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   Christ is slain for sinners before the foundation of the world in the mind of
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.800]   God. So with those three qualifications, the question is still a good one. That is,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.560]   how is God made more glorious by ruling a world or creating the world in which
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.960]   people, by His permission or design, however you want to describe it, will
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   wind up in hell justly? And the closest thing that I know to an answer in the
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.440]   Bible is found in the end of Romans 9, verses 22 and 23, and Paul says there
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:28.680]   that God aims to display His wrath and His power. His goal is that the full
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.240]   range of His perfections be known. I think this is the ultimate goal of the
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.640]   universe. God created the universe so that the full range of His perfections,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:49.800]   including wrath and power and judgment and justice, would be displayed. And to do
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.680]   that, there is, as it were, a dark backdrop of the history of redemption
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.560]   called the Fall and Sin, and the acts of grace and the acts of mercy and the
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.960]   experience of salvation shine the more brightly against the backdrop of the
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.680]   Fall and of Sin, so that two effects happen that glorify God. One is His
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.000]   grace, which I think is the apex of His glory, shines more brightly because it's
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.880]   against the backdrop of judgment and of sin, and we, the undeserving beneficiaries
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:40.560]   of this election and this redemption, are moved to a more exquisite joy and
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.400]   gratitude for our salvation because we see all the lostness of people who are
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.800]   no worse than we were, and we know better than them. We should be in hell as well,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.280]   and our gratitude will be intensified. So at least those two senses, I would say,
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.800]   are the answer to his question, "How does God get glory?" He gets glory because His
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   grace and mercy shine more brightly against the darker backdrop of sin and
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.800]   judgment and wrath, and our worship and our experience of that grace intensifies
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.480]   and deepens because we see we don't deserve to be where we are.
