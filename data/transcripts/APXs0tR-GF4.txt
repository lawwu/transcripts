[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:15.920]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, verses 5 to 9, from verse 5 to verse 9,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.680]   in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.760]   "Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with eye service, as men
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.560]   pleases, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with good
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.240]   will doing service as to the Lord, and not to men.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.600]   Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.000]   whether he be bond or free.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.640]   And ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening, knowing that your
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.960]   master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him."
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.680]   Now we come here to a new application of the principle which the apostle had been laying
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.120]   down in the previous chapter, especially in verses 18 and 21.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.320]   Here is the controlling thought.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.600]   Be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.560]   And then the actual application of that is in verse 21, "Submitting yourselves one to
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.680]   another in the fear of God."
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.280]   Now it is essential that we should bear in mind that that is the background.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.040]   We are looking here at one of the illustrations which the apostle gives us of how, being filled
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   with the Spirit, we are to submit ourselves one to another.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.680]   He has already shown us how that is to be done in the matter of the married relationship,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.040]   and he has also shown us how it is to be done in the home, in the relationship between children
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   and their parents.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.720]   And here he takes up this third illustration.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.360]   Now I say it is important we should remember the background for this reason, that these
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.200]   words are not addressed to the world as such.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.060]   The world is incapable of doing this.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.040]   This is possible only to people who are filled with the Spirit.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.160]   And therefore we must realise the importance of the context.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.920]   And as we do so, we are reminded again of certain very important things.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:10.280]   One is that our Christianity is something that covers the whole of our life and affects
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.760]   our every relationship.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.480]   Everything that the Christian does is the same as that which is done by the non-Christian.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.520]   They may do the same things, but they do them in a different way.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.540]   Christianity, I say, is not confined to the church, to Sunday.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.720]   It is something that manifests itself and reveals itself in the whole of life.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.080]   There is nothing more practical in the world this morning than the Christian faith and
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.640]   the Christian teaching.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.800]   And of course the very way in which the Apostle takes the trouble to work it out in these
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.480]   various departments of life is a proof of that in and of itself.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.600]   You see, he is not content with just saying, "Now those of you who are filled with the
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.720]   Spirit, submit yourselves one to another and leave it at that."
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.760]   No, as a very wise and able teacher, he knows that we've got to go into details, we've
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.340]   got to take these points up and apply them.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.400]   So he takes these examples, and the examples that he chooses are those which are quite
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.520]   typical and especially typical, of course, of where the stresses and the strains in life
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.760]   tend to manifest themselves most frequently.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   Clearly that was the rule which must have guided him in choosing these particular illustrations.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.280]   The most delicate relationship of all is the married relationship.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.860]   Well for that very reason, because it is the supreme relationship amongst human beings,
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.080]   the tensions and the stresses and the strains are liable to be at their greatest there.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.880]   And then next to that comes the family.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.480]   Here again is a most delicate, intimate relationship.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.640]   And the devil is always busy.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.560]   Where man is at his highest, the devil attacks him most strongly.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.580]   And then the third, you see, is this one of the relationship of masters and servants.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:26.040]   This comes probably next in order to the other two as the seat or the place where tensions
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.200]   and stresses and strains are most liable to be felt.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.600]   Well I needn't take your time.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.840]   You're all familiar with the fact that this particular relationship we are looking at
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:47.160]   here is one that has always caused a great deal of trouble throughout the history of
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   the human race.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.880]   You can read about it here in the Old Testament.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.840]   You can read about it in your secular history books.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:02.560]   It has always been the cause of trouble, tension, disagreement, and much quarreling.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.360]   And of course it still is.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.560]   It is one of the acute problems confronting this country, confronting all the countries
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.720]   of the world at this present hour.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   And I venture to go further.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.480]   It always will be a great problem.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.960]   While man is in sin, and while as a result of that he is always primarily and essentially
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:37.400]   selfish and self-centered, there are bound to be tensions in this particular relationship.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.000]   You see, we have multiplied the machinery to deal with this particular problem during
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.480]   this present century, and indeed during the last hundred years, in a quite exceptional
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.200]   manner.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.720]   Organizations and societies and acts of Parliament have been dealing with this whole problem
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.320]   of labor, relationship of master and servant.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:08.720]   Yet in spite of all this, it is one of the major problems confronting this country and
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.840]   all countries at this present hour.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:22.160]   And I say we should not be surprised at that, because as man is in sin, he is essentially
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.600]   in the first instance self-centered, selfish.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.440]   And as that is true of all, whatever their position in life, it is inevitable that there
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.360]   should be these problems and difficulties and stresses.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.040]   Well now then, fortunately for us, the Apostle takes the trouble to deal with this and to
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.520]   do so in detail.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   Now as we shall see, this is a very big and a very involved and a very difficult subject,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.360]   and therefore we must approach it very carefully.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.800]   And I am going to try to do so.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.480]   So hold yourselves in restraint.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.520]   You have all got strong feelings about this.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.040]   Do not jump to conclusions.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.880]   I am going to give you a series of points for your considerations.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.880]   And do not imagine that any one point has said everything.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.600]   It will be qualified by the next one.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.320]   So listen carefully and patiently.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:28.480]   The subject, I say, is so surrounded by difficulties that such an exhortation is essential.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.880]   The trouble about all this problem, of course, is that it is so frequently thought of by
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.600]   people in slogans, and they just hurl their slogans at one another, and that never gets
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   you anywhere.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.640]   The matter has got to be reasoned through and considered carefully in the light of the
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   teaching.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.560]   Very well, then, I would indicate, first of all, in the light of what the Apostle tells
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:57.960]   us here, that there are certain general characteristics of this Christian teaching with respect to
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.320]   this particular matter.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:06.360]   And the first is this one, of course, that it is quite unique.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:13.280]   The Christian teaching is unlike any other teaching whatsoever.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.840]   What we are looking at here this morning is something that cannot be found anywhere else.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.080]   I know there are other teachings that seem to look like it.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.040]   They have borrowed from it.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.240]   There are all sorts of philosophers who have borrowed from the Christian teaching.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.560]   They were not Christians, but they saw the excellence of certain aspects of Christian
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.520]   teaching, and they borrowed it.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.880]   And they have used it to suit their own purposes, and therefore there are teachings which may
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.480]   simulate the Christian teaching, but of course they never are the Christian teaching.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.440]   They always leave out the most vital thing of all.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:53.200]   We notice the uniqueness of the teaching and how it differs from everything else.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.520]   The second thing is this.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:04.800]   This teaching assumes that because we are Christian, we have undergone a very profound
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.960]   change at the very center of our life.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.360]   I mean by that, as I was saying just now, that this teaching is not addressed to the
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.000]   world.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.360]   It would be utterly pointless to take this teaching and to address it to a gathering
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:36.120]   of working people who are not Christians, or a gathering of employers who are not Christians.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.280]   That is, according to the New Testament, something which is really quite ridiculous.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.260]   To do that would mean that we do not believe in regeneration.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.240]   It would mean that we do not believe that man is entirely perverted as the result of
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.560]   sin.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.960]   It would mean that we do not agree that man is essentially selfish and self-centered.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.880]   But of course the whole of the biblical teaching is based upon that supposition.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.320]   And therefore these epistles are only addressed to churches, to members of the Christian church.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.880]   These were not newspaper articles put in the daily press.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.240]   They had not got newspapers, and even if they had, these would never have appeared in them.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   These are for churches, for church members, for Christians.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.120]   In other words, people who have been born again, who have got a new nature, a new outlook.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.200]   They are new creatures.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   Old things have passed away.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.360]   Behold, all things have become new.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   Now the Apostle has reminded these Ephesians of that at great length in the first three
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.840]   chapters, and then he has summed it all up again in chapter 4, beginning at verse 17.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.280]   He hath not so learned Christ.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.640]   Then he says in chapter 5, you were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.120]   New creatures.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.440]   It assumes them.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.680]   You see the significance of all this.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:08.640]   There are people whose names and statements are constantly appearing in the press, whose
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   names and contributions are in the press, mainly because they have never grasped that
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.140]   principle.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:21.040]   They think that Christianity is a teaching which can be offered to the world as it is,
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.680]   and they appeal to people to put it into practice.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.440]   They are denying the first principles of Christianity.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.080]   They are wasting their breath.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.480]   It never leads to anything.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.840]   Verily, of course, they have their reward, and that is the publicity.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.600]   But they do not touch the situation.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.080]   They do not make any difference whatsoever to what takes place.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:51.600]   But above all, I say, it is a complete denial of the whole basis of the Christian teaching.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:59.120]   It assumes a radical and an entire change in the people to which it is addressed.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.360]   But then thirdly, it assumes another thing.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.380]   It assumes that these people have got a knowledge of doctrine, and that they have an ability
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.500]   to work out that doctrine.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.700]   You see, that is the way the New Testament teaches us Christian living.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.480]   The New Testament does not come to us and say something like this.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.800]   "Well now, here you are, you are a Christian, and you have got certain problems, difficulties.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.380]   How are you to behave as an employee?
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.120]   How are you to behave as an employer?
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.120]   What are you to do?"
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.800]   "Ah, the only thing to do is take it to the Lord.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.200]   Just pray about it, and then he will show you how to do it.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   He will do it for you."
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.680]   No, no, that is not New Testament teaching at all.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.700]   New Testament teaching is this.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.800]   First of all, you are given your doctrines, your teaching.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.700]   Then you are told that you have got to apply that.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.640]   So obviously, if we do not know the doctrines, we cannot apply them.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.560]   If we have not an understanding of the teaching, how can we put it into operation?
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:09.880]   No, no, we first of all have the instruction, we receive it, we understand it, then we say
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.480]   "No, then in the light of this, this is what I have got to do."
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.760]   That is the New Testament doctrine of sanctification.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:22.040]   And what we have got here, of course, is just one practical example and illustration of
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.840]   how we show that we are being sanctified in practice.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.640]   This is the sanctified life in this matter of servants and masters.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.240]   But without a knowledge of the doctrine, it cannot be done.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.320]   And then the last general observation which I offer is this.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.520]   Once more, the balance and the fairness of the teaching.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.280]   It starts with the servants.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.880]   It starts in each instance, you remember, with those who are called upon to subject
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   themselves.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:04.640]   The wife to the husband, the children to the parents, the servants to the masters according
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.320]   to the flesh.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   But how careful he is to put the two sides.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.960]   Never injustice, never unfairness.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.920]   Husbands are told about their duties.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.520]   Fathers are told about their duties.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:26.960]   Masters are reminded here, "You masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.920]   knowing that your master also is in heaven.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.680]   Neither is there respect of persons with him."
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:42.440]   I remind you of that because it is to me one of the great glories of this teaching.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   It is what makes it so utterly, entirely unique.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.080]   There is nothing in the world that does this as the scripture does it.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.440]   To me, it is sufficient proof in and of itself of the fact that this is indeed the very word
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.280]   of God himself.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.000]   He looks down upon us all.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.400]   And all our divisions and distinctions of which we make so much, he puts them at the
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   right level.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.680]   He shows us the right perspective.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.200]   And everything is there under him.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   Very well.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   There are some general characteristics.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.460]   But now then, let us begin to approach the teaching.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.340]   And at once we find ourselves introduced to the great problem.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.460]   Servants.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.460]   What does that mean?
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:33.020]   Well, now, this is where our translations are a little bit unfortunate.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.880]   Because they do not give us the true impression of the meaning of the word.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.900]   It really means slaves.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.640]   Slaves.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.300]   The apostle was not dealing here with the case of hired servants.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:53.340]   There were in the civilization and in the world at the time these things were written,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.120]   there were hired servants.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.640]   There were house servants very often that were hired and were given their wages.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.960]   But the apostle is not dealing with that here essentially.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.280]   He is dealing with slaves.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.260]   For there was slavery at that time.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:14.520]   And many of these early Christians were literally slaves.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.920]   Now, we have got absolute proof that that is what he means here.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.080]   The word that the apostle used is enough in and of itself.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.000]   He used the word that is always used for slaves.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.360]   Not for hired servants.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.200]   But if there were any doubt, it is settled by verse 8.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.840]   Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord,
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:41.920]   whether he be bond, bound, that is a slave you see, or free.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.600]   There is your free man.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.880]   So the contrast is between a slave and a free man.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:54.160]   In other words, the apostle is quite definitely and specifically here dealing with the question
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:01.640]   of slavery and how the slave is to conduct himself.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:08.960]   In other words, we cannot look at this paragraph, this whole statement, without at once coming
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:17.040]   face to face with the problem of slavery and in particular the biblical teaching with regard
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   to slavery.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:24.120]   Now, the moment I say that, of course, you see at once that we are looking at a highly
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.000]   difficult and controversial subject.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.800]   There are many people who say their main reason for not being Christian is the attitude of
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.440]   the Bible and of the New Testament to slavery.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.840]   They say that is enough to damn it and they can have nothing to do with it.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.260]   It is often been a cause of great perplexity to many Christian people when they are involved
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.800]   in discussions with regard to this.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.280]   Throw your minds back.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:56.200]   Imagine what it must have been like 160 years ago when Wilberforce was waging his great
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.040]   campaign for the abolition of slavery in this country.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.600]   Try and cast your minds back to the 60s of the last century when they fought their civil
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.480]   war in the United States on this very subject.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:18.120]   There you see at once what a subtle and difficult and involved problem this really is.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.080]   And there is still a great deal of confusion with respect to it.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.480]   Very well, we are bound to look at this.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:31.040]   But let me remind you that in doing that we are not only looking at the problem and the
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.680]   question of slavery.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.000]   We are incidentally looking at a number of other problems.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.920]   We are looking at the whole problem of the relationship of the Christian to the state.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.400]   We are also looking at the whole problem of the relationship of the Christian to trade
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   and business at the present time.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.680]   Yes, and in particular to trade's unionism.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.480]   We are looking indeed at the whole problem of the attitude of the Christian to social
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:08.360]   conditions, to politics, reform, and even possible revolution and rebellion.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.280]   It's all here.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:17.680]   You see, the New Testament deals with great principles, and we are meant to apply them.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.920]   It would be foolish for somebody to say, "Well, if that deals with slavery, what's it got
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   to do with me?"
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.760]   Well, the answer is this.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.640]   Slavery is only one of the possible relationships of men to men.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.880]   And what the apostle is concerned about is the behavior and the conduct and the reaction
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:43.520]   of Christian people who are in any position of subservience to somebody else.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.200]   Christians who are implied in any sense, and it goes further.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:54.160]   We are all as it were subservient to the state, to social enactments and social conditions.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.180]   So I say that this subject, if we are to look at it truly and properly, will take us into
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.200]   all those various realms.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.280]   Here it was slavery.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.040]   Now the whole question is how does a slave conduct himself?
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.040]   What is he to do about it?
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.920]   Is he to try to get himself free?
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.320]   Is he to try to abolish this?
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.640]   Very well, you see, it leads to all the others immediately.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:22.920]   Any form of employment that is conceivable, any kind of social or economic relationship.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.200]   And that is why we should thank God for the scriptures.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.600]   There are people who look at these things superficially and say, "Well, now, here I
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.600]   am.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.160]   Should I join a trade union or not?"
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.040]   There's nothing in the Bible about trade union because they hadn't got trade unions at those
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.340]   times.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.760]   But the principle is here and it's in this very paragraph.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.480]   And therefore I say it is our business to look at it together.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.560]   Get hold of the principle, then apply it to the particular aspect of the problem with
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.840]   which you find yourself confronted.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:03.560]   Now it seemed to me that the best way of approaching this was to gather together the teaching of
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.880]   the Bible with regard to this subject.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.920]   And there are a number of passages that do deal with it.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:19.320]   We read one of them at the beginning, Matthew 22, 15 to 21.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:25.100]   When you remember certain of the Pharisees and Herodians came together to our Lord and
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:33.500]   put that catch question to him, "Shall we pay tribute unto Caesar or not?"
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.900]   And you remember our Lord's reply, "Show me the tribute money."
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.560]   And he looked at it and he said, "Whose is this image and superscription?"
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.100]   They said, "Caesar's."
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:49.980]   Then he gave that great reply, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:58.260]   and"—a thing they hadn't asked him about but which he added—"and unto God the things
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.900]   that are God's."
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.300]   And we are told that they marveled and went away surprised.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.980]   We can understand that, can't we?
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.660]   They had more than they bargained for.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.940]   They had a teaching that they'd never anticipated.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:22.860]   There is one other very interesting example of this selfsame thing which is often missed
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.860]   and forgotten.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.700]   It's at the end of the 17th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.500]   Let me just read it to you.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:36.420]   "And beginning at verse 24, when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.700]   money came to Peter and said, 'Doth not your master pay tribute?'
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.780]   He said, 'Yes.'
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.740]   And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, 'What thinkest thou,
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.740]   Simon?
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.600]   Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute?
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.220]   Of their own children or of strangers?'
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.500]   Peter saith unto them, 'Of strangers.'
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:06.420]   Jesus saith unto him, 'Then are the children free, notwithstanding.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:11.140]   Lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:16.820]   that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:24.620]   That take, and give unto them for me and thee.'"
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:30.220]   Then another classical statement, of course, is in the epistle to the Romans, chapter 13
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.220]   at the beginning.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.060]   "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:41.620]   For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.900]   Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.820]   And they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.260]   For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil, and so on."
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.060]   A most important statement.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:05.340]   Then there is that epistle to Philemon, which we read together at the beginning, and which
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:13.940]   of course is dealing quite directly and specifically with this whole question of slavery.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.340]   And then there is a reference to the same matter, the same principle, in the first epistle
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.260]   of Peter, chapter 2, beginning at verse 13.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.660]   "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of men for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.180]   king or supreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.860]   of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well, and so on."
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.220]   Then he goes on and says, "As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:49.140]   as the servants of God, then servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.700]   only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward."
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.420]   And remember these instructions about obeying the powers that be were written when the emperor
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:06.020]   was none other than the terrible men, the emperor Nero.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.140]   But they are told to be subject to him and to all such powers.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:15.340]   Now there are the chief examples of direct teaching.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.300]   But of course you get indirect teaching in the book of Daniel, in Daniel's conduct and
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.860]   behavior, consult especially chapters 3 and 6.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:30.460]   And then you get some very interesting implied teaching.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.940]   For instance, in the 16th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, where the Apostle
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:42.420]   Paul and Silas were arrested and thrown into the innermost prison and scourged and so on.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.220]   And you remember we are told that they were going to let them free, but the Apostle objected
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:52.660]   and said that as a Roman citizen he demanded that the magistrates who had wrongly subjected
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:58.020]   them to such treatment and imprisonment should themselves come in person and let them out.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.620]   It's an interesting side light on this whole question.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:09.100]   And there's a further example in Acts 25 where the Apostle Paul appeals to Caesar.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:16.220]   He had a right to do that as a Roman citizen, and there he exercised his right.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:22.760]   Well now then, there are the main passages in the scripture that have a bearing on this
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.980]   teaching that we are looking at here in Ephesians 6.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:35.780]   And once more I feel constrained to make some general comments, because here it seems to
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.940]   me is a very vital matter.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.340]   And my first comment is this.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:47.700]   Have you ever been struck by the fact that there is comparatively very little teaching
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:55.900]   in the scriptures on this subject directly and specifically?
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:05.220]   In this great volume, or in your New Testament, how little direct and specific teaching there
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:11.180]   is on this subject?
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:17.420]   There is what I've quoted to you, but it is mainly a matter of our deducing from the
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.300]   general teaching the principles which are to govern this matter.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:27.860]   Now to me that is a most important and significant matter in and of itself.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.860]   How?
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.300]   Well, in this way.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.300]   Why doesn't the Bible give more attention to this?
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:41.700]   Why doesn't the Bible give us much more teaching, in a much more abundant sense, with regard
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:49.620]   to this extraordinary problem that has always been so present in the life of the human race?
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.780]   Why such paucity of teaching?
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:04.260]   And here I think we arrive at one of our great general controlling principles, which is this.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:14.820]   The Bible's real big interest everywhere is in a man's relationship to God.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.940]   That's what it's about.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:25.140]   The object, the purpose of this book is to consider man's relationship to God, primarily.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:33.500]   All its stress, all its emphasis, all its space, as it were, is given to that.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:39.820]   Now our Lord, of course, pointed that out, as I say, in his reply to the Pharisees and
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.980]   the Herodians, and that is what makes that incident so significant.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.620]   Here come these men, you see, typical representative modern men.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.340]   "Master, is it lawful to pay tribute unto Caesar or not?
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.220]   What has the church got to say about apartheid?
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.340]   What has the church got to say about economics?
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.220]   What's the church got to say about war?
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.980]   Why isn't the church saying—is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or—" That's
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:03.980]   the question, you see?
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.220]   That's man's question always.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.780]   Not a word about man's relationship to God.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:17.380]   Oh no, man's relationship to men, our rights and justices, and so on.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.420]   So we're always asking these, but you see the reply, "Render therefore unto Caesar
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:30.480]   the things which are Caesar's, and the thing you've forgotten, and which gets you into
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.260]   a muddle about these particular problems.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:40.060]   Unto God the things that are God's."
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:49.500]   Now that, I say, is a perfect example of the biblical emphasis, the biblical attitude.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.660]   It is man's relationship to God that the Bible is concerned about.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:00.780]   That is its great message, its first message, always its first message.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:06.580]   Let me give you another illustration.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.100]   You remember a man, a scribe, came to our Lord and asked, "Which is the first and
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.260]   the greatest commandment?"
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:18.260]   Now you see, he again, like all those Pharisees and scribes, spent a lot of his time in arguing
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.780]   about these details of the law.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.100]   There were 613 of them.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.300]   And the question was, "Which was the greatest of these 613?
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.820]   One said this, the other said that."
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.460]   And there they were, arguing about all these.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.140]   They spent their time in doing that.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.540]   And the man came and said, "Now which do you say is the greatest?"
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:43.420]   And our Lord said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.060]   mind and strength."
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.740]   That is the first and the chiefest commandment.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.420]   And the second, yes, but its only second, is like unto it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.540]   as thyself."
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.100]   He doesn't put that first, you see.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.540]   Human relationships don't come first.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.580]   They never come first in the Bible.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.460]   It is always a man's relationship to God.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.300]   He breaks through all this petty, fogging, legalistic attitude.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.740]   This or that, no, no, he says.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.560]   That's the trouble with you Pharisees and scribes, he says elsewhere.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.980]   You tithe mint and rue and anise and cummin, but have forgotten the weightier matters of
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   the law.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.300]   You'll go and encompass sea and land to make one proselyte, but you've forgotten the love
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   of God.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.660]   You're seeing the big thing, the great thing, the central thing.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.780]   Well now, in the Bible, everywhere, that's the thing that matters.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.860]   It's here you see in our passage this morning, "Servants, be obedient to them that are your
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:43.660]   masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart,
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.940]   as unto Christ."
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:51.380]   Not with "I service as men pleases," but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.380]   from the heart.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.180]   He lifts it right up into the atmosphere of God and our relationship to him.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:02.300]   And he's careful to say the same to the masters, knowing that you, our master, also is in heaven.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.380]   Neither is the respect of persons with him.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.380]   Always the same.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.580]   Very well, there's the first comment which I would make on this teaching.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.500]   And that brings me to a second.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.860]   And this, of course, is the one that is hated by so many today, who claim that they are
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.340]   such practical men of affairs.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.780]   This is the great misrepresentation of Christianity at the present time.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.140]   But I put it like this as a principle.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:49.980]   Life in this world is always regarded in the Bible as being of secondary importance.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:57.820]   The Bible's view of life in this world is that it is just a pilgrimage, just a journey.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.700]   "What are we?"
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.980]   "Well," says Peter, "we are strangers and pilgrims."
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:10.980]   You've got it in the whole of your Old Testament, summed up so magnificently in the eleventh
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.940]   chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, the gallery of the saints, the heroes of the faith.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.140]   What was the truth about them?
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.700]   Well, here it was, they say.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:28.420]   These men were looking for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.340]   They regarded themselves but as strangers and pilgrims in the earth.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.220]   They were journeymen.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:41.580]   That is why Moses, you see, one of them, he had his eye on the recompense of the reward.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:50.020]   He preferred, therefore, to endure hardship with Christ and his people, rather than to
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:58.020]   enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.900]   These men of the Bible ride very loosely to this world.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.020]   They are but pilgrims, they don't belong to it.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.700]   They don't want to settle down in this world.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.060]   They know that that's wrong.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.220]   They're meant for another.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.860]   It's the other realm that matters.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.500]   It's the other realm that counts.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.460]   It's here everywhere in the New Testament.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.620]   Our Lord was always teaching that.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:26.580]   You get it in the epistle, "Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth."
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.740]   It's the great theme of the book of Revelation.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:35.580]   Now, I say it's very important for us to remember this, because it is the thing that
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.900]   controls the teaching with regard to slavery and all these other matters.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:47.380]   A man's relationship to God, yes, and his view of this present life as a passing, temporary,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.380]   evanescent something.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:55.380]   Now, it doesn't mean, of course, that this life and this world have got to be ignored.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.740]   It doesn't mean that you dismiss them, therefore, as having no importance at all.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.660]   No, no, it doesn't mean that for one minute.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.940]   Still less does it mean that you decide to become a monk or a hermit or an anchorite
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.300]   or something like that.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:14.700]   That of course was just a complete misunderstanding of the teaching.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.020]   But it does mean this, that we don't put this life first.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.140]   We don't start with this.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.940]   We don't always think about this.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.900]   No, no, this is only considered in the light of the art.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.660]   We are pilgrims of eternity.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.740]   We are a colony of heaven, says Paul.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.620]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.660]   That's where we belong.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.740]   We are still living in this world, but there's our home, there's our center, there's the
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.340]   seat of government for us in heaven.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.540]   Whence also we look for the Savior.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:56.340]   Now, I know of nothing that is more important at a time like this than that we should grasp
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:03.900]   that big controlling principle.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:14.900]   Man in his relationship to God, man in his right relationship to this world, it's secondary,
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.900]   not primary.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.140]   God first, heaven first, the glory first.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:25.860]   This temporary, preparatory, not permanent, we are moving on.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.860]   We don't neglect it.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:32.300]   We don't go out of the world, I say, but we keep it in its right subordinate position.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.980]   And it is in the light of that and that alone that we can understand this teaching.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:44.020]   Well, now I want to therefore draw a principle out of all this, and I put it in this form.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:54.060]   This must therefore always be the primary characteristic of the Church and of her teaching.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.220]   The business of the Church is to expand the Bible, the Scriptures.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.100]   And if those are the controlling principles in the Scripture, they are to be the controlling
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:09.380]   principles in the preaching and in the teaching of the Church.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:15.340]   And I am emphasizing that for this reason, that obviously therefore the primary business
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:24.820]   of the Church is not to deal with conditions as such, but rather with the Christians'
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:32.340]   relationship to them, and how he is to conduct himself while he still finds himself in them.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.420]   That is his task.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.940]   That is the task of the Church.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.060]   I do trust that I am making this plain.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:46.740]   As the Bible, and the Church is to preach the Bible, always puts its great and main
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:53.140]   and primary emphasis upon man in his relationship to God, and in this temporary relationship
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:58.500]   to this passing world, so must the Church.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.700]   So the Church must not spend her time in dealing with conditions as such in this world.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:09.060]   That is not her primary task.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.820]   And it is interesting to notice that it was not the task of the Church in the early centuries.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:18.540]   You get nothing of that at all, as I am going to show you.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.860]   There is no protest even against slavery in the New Testament.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.900]   You see, the business is not with conditions as such, but how the Christian is to work
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:33.740]   in these conditions, how he is to conduct and comport himself.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:40.300]   And I say that this is something which we must never lose sight of.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.860]   And I venture to suggest to you that the condition of the Church today is very largely due to
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.340]   the fact that this great principle has been forgotten.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:54.180]   I do not want to be controversial, but I am expounding Scripture.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:40:04.060]   I cannot find any justification in the Scripture for the notion of your so-called spiritual
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:08.100]   lords in the house of lords.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:14.340]   I can see no justification in the Scripture for bishops and archbishops taking their seat
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:21.140]   in the house of lords as members of the house of lords to conduct and to debate about politics
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.540]   and social affairs and conditions.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.540]   It is just not here.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:30.060]   They are there as bishops, as representatives of the Church.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.260]   Now that, I say, is something that cannot be justified from the Scripture.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.140]   But let me hasten to add this.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:45.460]   There is as little justification for free Church or nonconformist ministers who spend
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:50.340]   their time in preaching politics and economics and social matters.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:57.780]   They are both wrong, and they are both equally wrong.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:05.100]   Here is the task of the Church to be ever reminding men of their relationship to God,
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.580]   even as our Lord did.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.180]   People will come with their questions.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.620]   It is our business to see that the emphasis is on God and the relationship to God is put
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:17.260]   in the first place, and that we teach them the right attitude towards this present life
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.260]   and world.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.740]   That must never be in the center.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.420]   That must not be the main thing and the chief thing.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:30.980]   And to me, the tragedy of the world this morning is mainly this, that while it ought to be
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:37.420]   obvious to everybody that the main trouble in the world this morning is paganism, is
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:47.620]   godlessness, is irreligion in this and in every other land, whereas the main trouble
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:54.500]   is, I say, that men have forgotten God and their relationship to God and their eternal
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.500]   destiny.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.660]   While that is the position, the Church is spending the whole of her time almost in dealing
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:06.300]   with the secondary matters, the passing matters, the matters that are only dealt with incidentally
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:13.380]   in the Scriptures, merely as illustrations of the great general principles.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.060]   Isn't this tragic?
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.660]   The Church leaders, so-called, are always talking about these other matters that our
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:29.940]   Lord puts in a very subsidiary position, and the great central need is passing by default.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:37.100]   Well now, here you see his teaching which emerges, obviously and of necessity, out of
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.900]   what the apostle tells us here.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:47.140]   Now there is one other aspect of the matter that I might just mention at this point before
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:55.420]   we can go on to deal with the detailed teaching, and it is this.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:01.100]   There are those as Christians who, as I say, have been tempted to contract altogether out
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.140]   of the world, as it were.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.020]   There have been Christian people who say it is wrong for a Christian to vote at a borough
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.860]   election or a general election.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:17.620]   They regard it as sinful for a Christian to go in for politics, local politics or imperial
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:23.220]   politics, because that again is just a complete misunderstanding of the teaching.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:27.940]   It is as bad as the others that I have just been referring to.
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.140]   That is not what is taught here.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.100]   You have always got this balance.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.660]   You are not to go out of the world.
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.340]   You do not cease to be a citizen of this world, and you are to exercise certain functions
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.900]   as a citizen while you are in this world.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.660]   Yes, but keep it in the right place, keep it in the right position.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:51.020]   It is always this question of priorities and of emphasis and of what comes first and of
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.540]   what comes second.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:58.140]   Well now, then, there it is, and I am afraid we have got to leave it at that for this morning.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.540]   But as I told you at the beginning, the matter is one which is surrounded by so many difficulties
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:10.380]   and perplexities that the only safe way to approach it is to look at your scriptures,
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.900]   look at them carefully, bring them all together, compare scripture with scripture, do not rest
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.180]   out a text and say, "This is what the Bible says."
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.900]   Take it in its context, take it as a whole, put it together with all the others, then
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:27.860]   see the great principles of teaching.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:35.820]   And so we can leave it for this morning with this fundamental controlling idea in our minds
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.660]   and in our hearts.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:47.140]   If you and I cannot say that our first and chiefest concern is our relationship to God,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.900]   then what we may believe about these other matters is irrelevant.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:45:03.500]   If we cannot say that we are viewing our life in this world as temporary, passing, evanescent,
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.360]   again we are wrong.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.840]   If we in any shape or form, in our own thinking or in our talking to others, give the impression
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.820]   that this world and this life are everything, and this must always be at the center, this
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.100]   must be first, and we must always be talking about this, I say we are no longer in a New
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:23.820]   Testament position.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.300]   The problems are there and we have got to do something about them.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.580]   We have got to realize our relationship to them.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:44.500]   But if we do not do so in that way, remembering that it is all but passing, but temporary,
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:51.840]   and that what really matters is the fact that we belong there, we are not in the Christian
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.220]   position at all.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:46:00.140]   And our deductions are almost certainly, therefore, to be wrong.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.140]   Well there it is.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:06.180]   Let us try to think these things out during the coming week, that we may proceed from
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:14.620]   it to consider the teaching of the Scriptures, first and foremost with regard to slavery,
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:20.580]   but also with regard to any one of these positions where we are involved with other people in
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.940]   employment or under the state, or whatever it may be.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.300]   How am I to do about it?
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.220]   What is my relationship to it?
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:38.420]   And keep in the background of your mind, is rebellion ever justified or justifiable?
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:44.180]   These problems have had to be met by our forefathers in many centuries.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.300]   There are many in the world who are meeting them this morning.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.180]   Because they may not be so acute in Great Britain, there is no reason why you and I
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.860]   should not think about them.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:00.760]   We ought to know what we would do if such a position arises here, and it may.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.940]   But in any case, we ought to be able to help others.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.560]   You may have relatives in these different countries.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.100]   They may write to you, they may speak to you, they say, "You're a Christian, tell me,
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.600]   what am I to do?"
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:18.440]   It is our duty, my friends, to know the biblical teaching so that we can apply it to ourselves
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.240]   and help others to do so.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:27.800]   May God give us grace to do that, to the glory of his holy name.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.720]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
