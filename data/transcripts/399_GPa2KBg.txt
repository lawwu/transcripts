[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]   Alright final final segment of the show
[00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.720]   three interesting things
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.100]   This is where we take three things that I found interesting that you have sent to me in my interesting at Cal Newport comm email
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.160]   address that all relate to the general theme here of trying to live a deep life and
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.280]   I take three I like and we look at them. So if you are
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.640]   Listening to this show
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.380]   You might want to jump over to the YouTube version of the episode because the three things are visual
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.440]   That's youtube.com slash Cal Newport media
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.420]   We launch a video of the full episode of each podcast usually the same day that it comes out
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.740]   I'll explain in words what's on the screen here, but it's it's better than what so it's a good chance to jump over to YouTube
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:50.060]   All right. The first interesting thing I want to talk about is the director Guillermo del Toro or as I've discovered his fans
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.060]   Call him GDT
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.600]   his so-called bleak house
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.640]   All right, so I've loaded on the screen now an article. There's a lot of articles about this
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640]   This happens to come from a Southern California
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.840]   Radio station and the headline here is bleak house a tour inside Guillermo del Toro's creative man cave
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.240]   there is a picture of him in a
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.400]   Victorian decorated room with a terrifying monster
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.180]   Statue so here's the subhead. I'll read this on the screen right now
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.660]   The director behind pans labyrinth and hellboy owns a house filled with artifacts. He has collected throughout his life
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.380]   Now the reason why we're hearing about this is there's a exhibit they're now doing where you can come in a museum exhibit
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.420]   We can see a lot of these things, but the key thing is before this exhibit
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.700]   He has a two-story house filled with more than 10,000 items
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.580]   artwork sculptures artifacts books movies collected over a lifetime
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580]   But he insists he's not collecting for collecting sake
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.580]   So let's dive a little deeper. Here's a Guillermo quote
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.460]   This is a religious place for me. See to me everything that surrounds us is not a collection
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.820]   It's a relics its relics or its talent talismans, whatever you want to call them
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.020]   They have a spiritual hold of who I am. Essentially this goes right back to the question. We talked about before the break
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.340]   About the the value of having symbolic symbolic objects to capture your values
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.440]   GDT is getting right to the core of this. He sees these things he collects as relics. It's it's a power is being captured in there
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.540]   Where is the bleak house?
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.180]   It's a in the suburbs. He just bought a house in the suburbs of LA near his existing house and he gets into it
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.300]   Later in this article he gets into how this came about
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.380]   He was collecting this stuff because if you know GDT he does these these beautiful
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.900]   Fantastical movies that often have the macabre or terrifying in them
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.960]   So he was collecting these somewhat disturbing objects and at some point his wife very reasonably said this cannot be in our house
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.460]   Like we have young kids if you want to know what I'm talking about and you're watching on YouTube
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.600]   I have an example on the page of something that's in his bleak house. It's um
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.180]   It's a man's face that has been ripped open and there's like jaws coming out of it
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.180]   It's not the type of stuff you want in your house
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.460]   So he said fine, I'll buy another house and that's we're gonna store my collection
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.460]   So he has the second house. Here's another big picture. I put on the screen. It's cool. Jesse. Look at this
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.420]   It's a there's a monster a giant Frankenstein head
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.460]   The whole thing is done up Victorian red walls. All the pictures are covered in framed art, but it's like weird macabre
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.580]   Sort of Hieronymus Bosch style artwork like it's it's a old lamps and bookcases
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.940]   so
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.940]   Here's the quote by the way
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.660]   his wife said
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.180]   that's too close to the kitchen the kids are gonna get freaked out and
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.620]   He GDT said inside of me something cracked and I said I'm gonna get my own place
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.820]   He has a haunted mansion room based off the Disney thing. He has a room that simulates a rainstorm outside
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.080]   He has 13 libraries. So each room has a different library. He's that as a research area
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.300]   So like he this one opens you're in a room. That's a haunted mansion
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.000]   But the haunted mansion room has a library that's all about mythology folklore fairy tales and myths
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.380]   Etc. So he uses this house
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.380]   not just to capture things that are valuable to him, but also as a
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.180]   Source of creative inspiration so he's not just reading about fairies when he's working on pans labyrinth. He's in a haunted mansion room
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.900]   Taking these old volumes off of the shelf
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.400]   I think this stuff really matters and I talked about this a lot on the show if you do any sort of creative endeavor
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.380]   Where you're trying to alchemize value out of the stuff in your mind environment metal rituals matter objects matter
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.120]   If you're an accountant, you might say this is crazy. You bought a second house just to store stuff how indulgent or whatever
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.500]   But this is at the core of what GDT does for a living these fantastical
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.340]   Incredibly creative inspired visual masterpiece style movies. This is just a completely pragmatic investment
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.040]   And I think people might say something similar about the deep work HQ
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.660]   But for what I do for a living
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.380]   It's an investment that makes a huge amount of sense to have a place to come to that
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.860]   I'm specifically decorating to celebrate what I care about in terms of cognitive work that have the ritual of coming here versus somewhere else
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.500]   The the lab we're building in here and Jesse's Saul today when he came back from vacation
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.920]   I bought a lot more electronics equipment because
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.640]   Me and my oldest son are
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.800]   Building things and that's really important to me and having that connection to so it seems completely crazy to you know
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   I don't know like my brother
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.840]   But to me because of what I do it's like, of course, I'm gonna invest in this, you know, it matters
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.400]   Symbolic value matters ritual matters location matters. So anyways, I just think this is cool
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.380]   here's a I like this picture so for those who are watching there's a picture of a a
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.100]   Incredibly scary looking doll on an old Victorian
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.020]   Shay's lounge and I just I want to pull this up because of the photo caption
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.020]   Which just reads a couch piled with books and a demonic doll
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.280]   an awesome photo caption
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.740]   Here's the freaks room that guy's there I'm just sure if you're you're listening I'm just showing like terrifying pictures on the screen
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.540]   There's a simulated rainstorm room. Anyways, I put the link to this article in the show notes
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.380]   So there's Frankenstein drinking tea now Frankenstein's monster. I should be precise here drinking tea film room
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.680]   Anyways, I love that stuff Jesse who wins
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.200]   GDT's bleak house Brandon Saranson's underground lair
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.320]   Seems like GT had more stuff to look at I think he has to I think it's right
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.680]   I think he has the cooler house. It's Oregon is bigger. I love the idea of having themed rooms for different libraries
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.280]   Sanderson just wins on the coolness factor of being underground. Yeah, but it's yeah
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.540]   I'm gonna give I'll give this one that you also might just be upset because he has an answer, you know
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.780]   Door-knocking when you're outside is how it's just me shirtless
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.420]   Sanderson
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.340]   So now you're just knocking this. Yeah screw his lair
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.420]   *outro music*
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.280]   (upbeat music)
