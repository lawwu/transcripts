[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   Well, today's episode zeroes in on pastoral leadership, but it's relevant for every Christian.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.880]   How can a pastor revitalize a church from the pulpit?
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.160]   Question comes from Corey, an elder.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.200]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.200]   This is admittedly a very broad leadership question and very open-ended, but if you were
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.500]   looking to refresh a church's vision and really set forth a compelling trajectory to inspire
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000]   a whole local church forward in its work, what would you focus on?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.400]   What would you preach on?
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.240]   How would you do it?
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.540]   First, let me clarify that I don't see this question relating to any particular season
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.120]   in the church, but relating to virtually every season in the church.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:04.320]   I never thought, and I don't think now that we should think of seasons where a church
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.120]   doesn't need refreshment of its vision, picture of a compelling trajectory, strong inspiration
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.840]   of the whole church moving forward together.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.920]   So I'm going to adjust the question in my mind and would encourage Corey to do the same.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.720]   What the church needs every Sunday, every Sunday is fresh vision, compelling direction,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.180]   deep and strong inspiration.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.960]   If things are going to go well in the church and it's going to grow, this is going to be
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   necessary.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.880]   In fact, whether things are going well or going hard, if things are going well in the
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.520]   church, if it's growing, if people are coming under conviction of sin and repenting and
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.720]   being saved and being transformed into humble, godly mothers and fathers and children and
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.720]   single people and citizens and employees, and if missions are advancing and the budget
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.860]   is being met, what the church needs is the same thing in those moments that it needs
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.720]   when people are languishing and discouraged and growth is not happening and no one is
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.280]   getting saved.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.800]   I never, in all my ministry, I don't think, I never took for granted that a moment of
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.340]   spiritual prosperity would last another week.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.120]   It's just not the way people are.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.880]   It's not the way institutions are.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:48.020]   Our spiritual buckets can leak out in a week or be knocked over in a moment.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.760]   Everything is fragile.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   From a human standpoint, if God withdraws His sustaining hand for one week, everyone
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.960]   will feel like things are falling apart.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.720]   Everyone will be discouraged.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.020]   Sin will take root.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:13.280]   So when I answered the question about refreshing a church's vision and setting a compelling
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.320]   trajectory and inspiring everyone for the work ahead, I'm answering the question, "What
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.120]   is preaching?
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.760]   What is preaching?
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.080]   What do you do when you preach?"
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:36.440]   And my approach to vision and trajectory and inspiration was and is this.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:45.640]   Week in and week out, stretch the mental and emotional capacities of your people with the
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.120]   greatness of God and the unsearchable riches of Christ and the grandeur of the work of
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.680]   salvation and the immeasurable glory of our eternal future at God's right hand with
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.560]   pleasures forevermore.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.960]   That's my strategy.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.480]   For example, back in the late 80s and 90s, we were turning the ship of our church in
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.960]   the area of global missions from a focus that was diffuse, say, toward a greater emphasis
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.880]   on unreached peoples and the concrete finishing of the Great Commission to get the gospel
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.320]   to all the peoples of the world.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.760]   And I was doing a lot of speaking at missions conferences and to a lot of pastors, and they
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:39.000]   would ask me, "How do you get a church fired up for global missions, for evangelizing the
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.480]   whole world, for unreached peoples?"
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.360]   And it became clear to me pretty soon that my answer had to be this.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:59.200]   You create vision and trajectory and inspiration for missions by not preaching about missions
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.520]   but about God, who happens to own the world, run the world, have a plan for the world that
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.280]   cannot fail, like, "This gospel will be preached as a witness to all the nations, and then
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.800]   the end will come," Matthew 24, 14.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.880]   In other words, it seemed hopeless to me—still does—it seems hopeless to me to try to create
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:31.260]   a glorious vision for global missions on the back of a puny vision of God.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:38.680]   And I would generalize that and say that's the problem in most programmatic churches.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.760]   They desperately want to mobilize people with a vision for something like evangelism, small
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:54.200]   groups, justice issues, godly parenting, vibrant worship, and on and on.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.240]   And these trajectories, these visions, are pursued prematurely.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.760]   Whatever energy a pastor with a personality can stir up, it won't last.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.640]   It just won't last.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.880]   If it doesn't rest on a great, ever-growing vision of God, the greatness of God, the beauty
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.800]   of God, the worth of God, the wonder of God, the power and wisdom and justice and wrath
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.040]   and grace and patience and goodness and sovereignty of God.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.160]   And this vision must be clarified every week, brightened in the eyes of our people every
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   week.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:42.600]   And if you ask, "So, Piper, you think we should preach on the doctrine of God every
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   Sunday?"
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.760]   Well, actually, here's the way I would say it.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:56.920]   No, preach on everything that is in the Bible, every imaginable, practical, nitty-gritty
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.960]   problem of your people.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:11.240]   But every Sunday, trace this issue down to its deepest root and up into its highest branches.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.560]   Preach about televisions and tennis shoes and sore throats and tattoos and football
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.240]   concussions and public schools and private schools and gluttony and laziness and workaholism
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.840]   and on and on and on.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.760]   Christ relates to everything, absolutely everything.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.480]   He's Lord of the universe.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.320]   He's Lord of everything in your life, whether you eat pizza or drink Diet Coke, do all to
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   the glory of God.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.040]   That's an actual quote from 1 Corinthians 10:31.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:52.760]   But when you take up these ordinary daily things, take them all the way up, all the
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   way up.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.760]   Here's the problem.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.040]   If you don't take those up, it'll take them anywhere.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.360]   They just become moralistic and practical, and they don't take them up, up, and become
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.200]   uniquely God-centered, all the way up into God.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.500]   Make people see the greatness of God.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:18.400]   If you're going to talk about tattoos or $300 tennis shoes or overeating, bring these things
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:25.640]   and bring your people up into a whole new world, a whole new world of vision about how
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.520]   to live and how to think and how to feel everything in relation to the greatness and the glory
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.160]   and the grandeur of God.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:42.600]   Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, greatly to be known, greatly to be loved,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.180]   greatly to be served, greatly to be desired and enjoyed.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.480]   And that's true all the time, all the time, in every relationship, in every issue, in
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.280]   every sermon.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.800]   Nobody comes into the world with this experience.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.960]   It is a miracle, a gift of the Holy Spirit, and one of the ways, one of the ways—and
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:13.200]   oh, I love this because God's called me to it—one of the ways, the great ways of
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.160]   wakening people to the greatness of God and the greatness of His praise is preaching.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.860]   So that's my approach.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:29.080]   Take up every issue, every vision, every trajectory, and take it all the way up into the greatness
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.500]   of God every week.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   All the way up.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.800]   That's great, Pastor John.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.520]   Thank you for this incredible reminder.

[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   episode on Monday.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.120]   My guess is we will, but I don't know what the topic will be.

[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.520]   Lord willing.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.020]   Amen.
