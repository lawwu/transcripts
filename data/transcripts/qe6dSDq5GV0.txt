[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.660]   So there is a famous experiment that was published last year by Joe Takahashi's lab, and it came
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.120]   out in Science, and that relates to caloric restriction. And we kind of started with this
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.360]   idea, we started discussing that the rat experiments were done with caloric restriction, and researchers
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.340]   gave reduced calorie consumption by 20 percent or 30 percent and gave that food, the rats,
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.200]   and then subsequently mice, and they all lived longer. What is interesting is, in all those
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.300]   experiments, the researchers came and gave this bolus of food at one time, whereas the
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.700]   ad libitum fed mice or rats, they had access to food all the time. So they were eating
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.000]   all the time, and then these rats were given 20 percent less. And what happens is, these
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.800]   mice or rats, they're not going to take that less food, which is rationed now, and just
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.300]   eat a little bit of lunch and then snack after three hours or snack after three hours. They
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.140]   gobble up all that food. Within two to three hours, maximum four hours, food is gone.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.320]   So they're sort of on the OMAD diet, the one meal a day.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.120]   Yeah. They're almost like in one meal a day, three to four hours, food is gone. Or you
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.940]   can say they're on four hours eating or feeding and 20 hours fasting. So then the question
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:38.060]   became, well, the benefit of caloric restriction, as we know, is it due to reduced calorie or
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.220]   time-restricted feeding? There is a timing component to it, that they're eating all of
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.340]   that within three to four hours, and then there is a long fasting. And this is a difficult
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.820]   question to answer, because now you have to ask these poor grad students or technicians
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.460]   to come and split that food into eight or 10 or 15 different small portions and then
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.340]   give them to mice in every two hours. So Joe Takahashi, who actually published the first
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.220]   paper in 2017 showing that most caloric restrictions, I mean, he used the protocol that was used
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.220]   by caloric restriction field, it actually creates a condition of time restriction. So
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.460]   he showed that, and then he went back and worked with engineers to come up with a smart
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.660]   case where he could actually tell, he could program how much food is given to mice at
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.700]   what time of the day or night, completely programmed. So then he took this, for example,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.500]   let's say the ad libitum fed mice eats five grams of chow in a day. And if you want to
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.620]   reduce calories by 20%, then the CR mouse should get four grams of food. And he divided
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.060]   this into nine or 10 meals, and then gave them in every 90 minutes. So in this case,
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.900]   they are eating small meals throughout day and night, so there is no fasting. So you
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.620]   can say that, well, this mouse actually is not getting into fasting because in every
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.620]   few hours is getting some food. And then he measured how long the mouse is going to live.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.660]   And he used account, means this is a very standard protocol, people count how many mice
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.700]   are dying on which day and then examine them to see whether they died because there was
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.380]   an accident or they actually, there was a natural cause. And then they calculate at
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:47.220]   the end, what is the half life? So 50% survival, because that's on an average, that's a good
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.500]   indicator because if there is an outlier that will live for a long time, then that can skew.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.220]   So what was interesting was the ad libitum fed mice, of course, they live certain number
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.940]   of days, and then this caloric restricted mice that never got into super fasting, but
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.700]   kind of eating, snacking throughout day and night, that also lived 10% extra, 10% longer.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.460]   So that means caloric restriction extended lifespan by 10%.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.440]   - I've wondered about this because recently, you know, there's been, there were a bunch
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.020]   of news headlines about intermittent fasting. And frankly, I was frustrated if you looked
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.940]   at one major news outlet, they would say time restricted feeding affords no additional benefit
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.300]   beyond caloric restriction for weight loss. Then another popular press venue, let's call
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.340]   it that, same study described as time restricted feeding doesn't work. Right. And then another
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.940]   one, maybe someplace even more extreme, you know, time restricted feeding only beneficial
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.620]   because of caloric restriction or something like that. So what you've essentially got
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.660]   are three different interpretations of the same data, all of which are, well, two of
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.940]   which are true, one of which is false in my opinion. But what I think people take away
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.940]   from that is, oh, time restricted feeding isn't valuable, which is not the case. I think
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.060]   for many people, it's a convenient way to eat because at least for people like me, it's
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.140]   simpler to designate between portions of my day when I'm eating and portions of my day
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.660]   when I'm not eating, as opposed to portion control. For other people, portion control
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:34.060]   can work. But all of that is related to either maintenance or loss of weight. None of it
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.420]   deals with the potential health benefits independent of weight loss. And so I think that if we
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.500]   can segment those out, obviously in humans, it's hard to know if a given treatment or
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.940]   experiment is extending life because you don't really know how long people would live anyway.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.060]   Right. Whereas with mice, you have some sense of when the mortality was likely to occur.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.340]   So what can we say about time restricted feeding and longevity in terms of biomarkers or in
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.980]   terms of any other indication that people who start and stop their feeding window at
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.340]   a consistent time, somewhere between eight and 12 hours per 24-hour cycle, are tilting
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.580]   the scales towards living longer as opposed to living shorter?
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.540]   This example of this news article that you mentioned is really interesting because that
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.420]   relates to Joe Takahashi's study, because I described that if you split calories and
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.900]   eat throughout the day, throughout day and night, then the mice live 10% extra. But if
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:41.540]   you now give mouse the same calorie restricted diet and feed them during daytime, whether
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.380]   within 12 hours or two hours, then the mice live 10% extra.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.380]   Beyond that?
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.380]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.380]   So 20% longer.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.380]   20%.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.460]   So, okay. So let me make sure I understand so that I make sure I understand. If you take
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.660]   a certain number of calories and you distribute them throughout the 24-hour cycle, it's caloric
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.300]   restriction, the mice will live 10% longer. If you, however, restrict that to the active
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:14.420]   cycle, so for humans, the daytime, then they live 20% longer.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.420]   20% longer.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.620]   So it's not just total caloric intake, meaning it's not just important to be sub-maintenance
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.700]   in calories for sake of longevity. It also is important as to when in the 24-hour cycle
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.940]   you eat those calories. Do I have that right?
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.980]   So now, that's still, the story is not over because these mice are fed during daytime
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.420]   when they're not supposed to eat.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.380]   That's right. So for us, it would be the equivalent of being on the night shift and only eating
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.940]   at night, but a sub-caloric, sub-maintenance calorie diet, I guess is the right way to
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.940]   say it.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.300]   But when you fed mice during nighttime when they're supposed to eat and they're getting
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:56.620]   the same number of calories within 12 hours or two hours, then the mice live 35% longer
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.620]   than they control.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:05.940]   35% longer. So scale to human lifespan, which we don't know, but 35% longer would mean that,
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.940]   and again, no one knows, but humans now, what is the average mortality in the United States,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.940]   somewhere around 80?
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:18.220]   Yeah, so it's around 80. It used to be 80, now it's reduced a little bit because of COVID,
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.220]   but let's take 80.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.500]   Okay, so people are then now living somewhere between 25 and 35 years longer. I'm putting
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   some error bars on that.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   Amazing.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:35.820]   So that was really profound, but now you pointed out biomarker and other stuff. So now, if
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:42.540]   you look at any given time within that experiment, and actually Joe went back and had a separate
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.100]   cohort of mice, very similar, and so that he could take tissue samples. And of course,
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:53.620]   in this case, you have to sacrifice the mouse. And he looked for, he did a lot of molecular
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:00.660]   analysis with known markers, for example, hemoglobin A1C equivalent, or glucose control,
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:07.940]   cholesterol, all this stuff. He could not find anything that predicted the benefit of
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:14.380]   caloric restriction. So that means in this experiment, whatever we know so far, the predictor
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:23.140]   of longevity, none of them could predict whether this CR only mouse, which ate throughout day
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:29.180]   and night, that mouse is going to live less than the night fed mouse that was going to
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.700]   live 25% extra.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.580]   Does that mean that there are biomarkers related to longevity that we just haven't discovered
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.580]   yet?
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:44.020]   Yeah, so that's exactly. So that means whatever we know so far about biomarkers, he could
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.820]   not use to predict. Maybe there was a lot of noise, maybe he had to use more number
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:55.540]   of mice to get that, because biomarkers are not going to predict in every instance that
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:01.740]   there is some error. What is also very interesting is, if you look at the body weight and body
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:07.400]   composition of all these mice, there is no difference in body weight and body composition.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   Across all these different groups?
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   Across all these groups.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:15.900]   So it doesn't matter when they ate, provided they were sub-maintenance calorie intake,
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.620]   fewer calories than is required to maintain their weight, didn't matter what pattern of
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.900]   eating, they were the same weight. So that in many ways seems to mimic the human studies
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.980]   where they say, "Look, it doesn't really matter whether or not you use caloric restriction,
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.940]   or you start your feeding window in the morning, or start your feeding window in the evening,
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.900]   or you portion control for sake of weight loss."
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.300]   Because they're taking a snapshot of that. And then another thing with the human study
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:49.380]   that we are referring to here, in that human study, people are actually already eating
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:56.740]   within 10 hours window, habitually, when they selected these people to have them enroll
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:03.260]   in the study. So they were already eating for 10 hours and fasting for 14 hours. All
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:10.740]   participants had to reduce their caloric intake, and they reduced by almost 25%. The CR group
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.500]   continued with 10 hour sitting window, and the CR plus time-restricted group had to eat
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.660]   the same number of calories within eight hours.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.980]   - So it's just a two-hour difference.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.460]   - It's just a two hours difference.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.340]   - Okay, so that people, I just want to make sure people can understand. So in this human
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.860]   study, which is the one that I felt that the popular press venues, all except one venue,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.620]   got either semi-wrong or badly wrong in terms of their conclusion. That was my interpretation
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.300]   anyway, was that either people came into the study eating basically in a 10 hour feeding
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.180]   window, which goes back to my first question, which is that most people are not eating in
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.660]   the middle of the night, or if they're on shift work and they are, then they're sleeping
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.940]   during the day anyway. So they're eating in a 10 to 12 hour feeding window anyway. So
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.700]   you're saying they either did caloric restriction, portion control within the 10 hour window,
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:02.980]   or another group within the study ate sub-maintenance calories. So caloric restriction, CR, as we're
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.260]   calling it, the acronym CR, but restricted that to an eight hour feeding window. And
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.420]   they didn't see any difference in terms of weight loss. But it's not all that surprising,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.460]   right? I mean, if it's just a two hour difference.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.940]   - Yeah, exactly. So we have done that experiment in mice and we don't see difference in not
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.460]   only weight loss, many other markers. And I was telling you about this Joe Takahashi's
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:31.380]   paper where I told you that he allowed these mice to eat within two hours or 12 hours,
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.540]   sub-caloric diet.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.540]   - Two or 12?
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.540]   - Two or 12.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.540]   - Yeah, that's dramatic.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:43.540]   - But still, he did not see change in longevity even within those two. So that means when
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:51.860]   you do caloric restriction and then at least for mouse, and you are within 12 hours window,
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:58.540]   that is giving the mice the best benefit, the optimum benefit. And two, three, or five
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:10.420]   or 12 for a mouse doesn't matter, at least for longevity.
