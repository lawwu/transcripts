[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   God's sovereign power over all of his creation and over every one of his creatures is one
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.760]   of the grandest themes throughout the entire Bible.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.180]   We love to celebrate this magnificent reality over and over on the podcast.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.300]   So often it may be a little daunting for newcomers to the theme.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.920]   For someone looking for a primer into this grand reality, what are the basics of God's
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.920]   sovereignty?
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.200]   It's a great question from a listener named Steven, who writes us from China.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.600]   "Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.400]   Can you explain to me the sovereignty of God in a very simple way?
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.760]   What are the big themes to see and grasp and understand first?
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.040]   I don't know where to start."
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.640]   Pastor John, what would you say to Steven?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.200]   Well, I like to make every effort to keep things clear and simple, and I think one of
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.120]   the reasons we don't speak with much clarity sometimes is that we don't start with definitions.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.640]   So that's where I like to start on almost every conversation I have is let's make sure
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.200]   we know what we're talking about.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.360]   So let me propose some definitions, and then we'll test them with the Bible, and then we'll
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.700]   end with maybe what he's asking, what are some of the big issues surrounding it?
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:27.100]   So as an adjective, sovereign, when we say God is sovereign, we mean powerful and authoritative
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.460]   to the extent of being able to override all other powers and authorities.
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.740]   So that's my effort at a definition.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:49.060]   Nothing can successfully stop any act or any event or design or purpose which God intends
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.100]   to certainly bring about.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.740]   That's my definition.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.100]   Is it biblical?
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.580]   That's the question, because what I think really doesn't matter if it's a reflection
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.760]   of what the Bible says.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.740]   It matters a lot.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.220]   So nothing, I'm arguing, nothing can thwart, stop His purposes.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.020]   Job 42.2, when all is said and done, Job says, "I know that you can do all things, and no
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.900]   purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.780]   I think that's just about the best definition of sovereignty in the Bible.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.340]   Daniel 4.35, "He does according to His will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:43.820]   of the earth, and none can stay His hand or say to Him, 'What are you doing?'"
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.300]   Or positively, that's—nobody can stop it.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.140]   Here's the positive way of saying that He will accomplish all His will.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:00.160]   Isaiah 46.9, "I am God, and there is none like Me, saying," so you hear what God says
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:10.040]   about His godness, "My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all My purpose."
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.380]   So there's nothing that He purposes that He does not accomplish.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.780]   Nothing can stop Him, and He does it all.
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.660]   Or Ephesians 1.11, one of the most sweeping statements of sovereignty in the Bible, "He
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.780]   works all things according to the counsel of His will."
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.600]   So whatever happens, it accords with the counsel of God's will.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.300]   Then you can test those general statements about God's sovereignty with lots and lots—I'm
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.140]   working on a book on this, so there's hundreds of places I could have gone—so lots of examples
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.100]   of kinds of details that the Bible talks about.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.700]   Like He's sovereign over random events, seemingly random events.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:08.360]   Like Proverbs 6.33, "The lot," or the dice, "are cast in the lap, but every decision
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.180]   is from the Lord."
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.920]   Something as random as rolling dice or casting a lot.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.140]   Or sovereign over nature, Psalm 135.6, "Whatever the Lord pleases, He does in heaven and on
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.300]   earth, in the seas and all deeps.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.420]   He it is who makes clouds rise at the end of the earth, who makes lightnings for the
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.740]   rain, who brings forth wind from its storehouses."
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:38.540]   Or Matthew 8.27, Jesus, "Even winds and sea obey Jesus."
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.780]   So winds and sea, they do His bidding.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.820]   Sovereign over animals, Matthew 10.29, "Not one sparrow will fall to the ground apart
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.820]   from your Father."
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.380]   I think that's Jesus' way of reaching for the most minute, seemingly insignificant
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.620]   thing in the world, is a little bird dropping out of a tree in the midst of some jungle
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.780]   somewhere that nobody knows about but Him, and He decides when it will fall.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.660]   Or over nations at the other end of magnitude, 2 Chronicles 26, "You rule over the kingdoms
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.760]   of the nations.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.620]   In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand you."
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.060]   So no nation does anything that God does not purpose.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.220]   Or Psalm 33.10, "The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.060]   He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.060]   The counsel of the Lord stands."
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.020]   I love these sentences!
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.860]   The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart, to all generations.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.540]   Or over every single human decision.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.220]   Proverbs 16.1, "The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue"—that
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.780]   is, what actually happens—"is from the Lord."
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.700]   Or Proverbs 16.9, "The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps."
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.060]   So we have all kinds of thinking that we do, but in the end, the Lord decides.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.420]   Proverbs 19.21, "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.860]   Lord that will stand."
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.580]   Or Proverbs 21.1, "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.020]   He turns it wherever he wills."
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.740]   Or Genesis 50.20, this sentence ought to be written like a banner over every evil and
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.260]   sin that's ever committed.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.460]   "As for you," Joseph says to his brothers who sold him into slavery, "as for you, you
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.420]   meant evil against me, but God meant it."
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.100]   So the very same thing—evil in your intention, the same event—good.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.980]   God meant it for good to bring about many people that they should be kept alive as they
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.060]   are today.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:17.180]   And then you could go to Psalm 115.3 and just overall, "Our God is in the heavens.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.300]   He does all that He pleases."
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.660]   So my answer is, yes, it is biblical to say that God is sovereign and to mean by that
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:35.600]   that He has such power and such authority that nothing can successfully stop any act
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.380]   or purpose which God intends to certainly bring about.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.980]   Now Stephen asked, "What are the big things to see and grasp?"
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.220]   So let me just mention two, two big things.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.860]   Number one, the sovereignty of God is governed by His wisdom.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.980]   "Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.340]   How unsearchable are His judgments!
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.100]   How inscrutable are His ways!"
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.300]   Romans 11.33.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:17.220]   Everything that is unsearchable and inscrutable to us is governed by the deepest divine wisdom.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:25.300]   God never does anything or allows anything whimsically that is as meaningless or random
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.660]   or without an infinitely wise purpose.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.660]   That's huge.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.460]   That is a big thing that we must come to terms with when we think about God's sovereignty.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.980]   And here's the other one.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:42.100]   His sovereignty is governed by His justice and His mercy.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.780]   Isaiah 30.18, "The Lord is a God of justice.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.820]   Blessed are all those who wait for Him."
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.900]   Or Romans 9.14, "Is there then injustice on God's part?
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.700]   By no means!"
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.620]   God never, never wrongs anyone.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.140]   All that He does is righteous and just.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:15.180]   But even justice is not the final and highest aim of God's wisdom.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:25.220]   The ultimate aim is that He be glorified for His mercy, His grace toward undeserving rebels.
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:34.340]   He sovereignly planned and accomplished salvation for sinners by the death of His Son so that—now,
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:43.140]   this is a quote from Romans 15.9—so that the nations would glorify God for His mercy.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:52.140]   Or as Ephesians 1.6 says, "To the praise of the glory of His grace."
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.460]   So those, it seems to me, are the big things to grasp about God's sovereignty.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:05.380]   Number one, it is unstoppable power and authority over all things, including the human will.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:14.340]   And two, it is all in accord with infinite wisdom, infinite justice, infinite mercy through
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.340]   Jesus Christ.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.340]   Wonderful.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.020]   Yeah, I cannot wait for that book on sovereignty, which you began in 2018, and will be completing
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.780]   this summer, Lord willing.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.460]   We'll talk more about that project later.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.340]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to the podcast.

[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.480]   While does Jesus condemn the comforts of the middle-class American life?
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.340]   Some texts suggest so, particularly Luke chapter 6.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.020]   This is one of those really important questions we get all the time.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.340]   Next time, we'll look at the woe texts as they relate to our lives today.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.140]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:57.940]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
