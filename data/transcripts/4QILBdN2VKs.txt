[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.200]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter of the sixteenth verse.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.360]   The sixteenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.800]   And of his fullness have we received, and grace for or upon grace.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.280]   Now we are still analyzing and considering this great and profound statement.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.040]   It's here as you see and as you remember in the prologue of John's Gospel.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.240]   And my whole contention is that in this prologue the apostle is setting before us the theme
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.040]   of the whole of his Gospel.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.880]   It is like, if you like, an overture to some opera or something of that kind in which the
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.240]   themes are gathered together.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.200]   It's an introduction.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.160]   And in these, all these major themes are put before us.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.860]   And we've already seen that, how he states this tremendous fact about the Lord Jesus
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.640]   Christ, the word that was in the beginning and that was with God and so on.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:26.520]   But now in this verse he sums up all the blessings that come to those who believe on the Lord
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   Jesus Christ.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.240]   He has already told us in verses twelve and thirteen that believing on him we become the
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.160]   children of God.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.200]   And then here is this further statement which is a kind of summary of all the various blessings
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.520]   which come to those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as they are unfolded in the subsequent
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.240]   portions of this great Gospel.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.960]   And therefore it clearly is something to which we should give considerable time and attention.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:07.800]   The very words themselves, of course, are a resting of his fullness of all we receive
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.960]   and grace upon grace.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   It's not only a wonderful summary of what is possible to us, but it's at the same time
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.560]   obviously a very great and profound test, therefore, of our whole position.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.080]   Have we received of this fullness?
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.080]   Are we aware of that?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.620]   Are we certain of it?
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.040]   That should be the position of every Christian.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.480]   Well now then, we are analyzing this in order that we may not only discover our own true
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.640]   state but in order that we may truly receive of this fullness.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.440]   And obviously in order to do that we've got to concentrate on this whole matter as to
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.960]   how that fullness becomes possible to us.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.240]   We've seen that it is all in him.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.920]   All the fullness of the Godhead is in him.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.400]   And when he was here on earth, all the fullness of the Godhead was in him bodily.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.600]   It pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.080]   Well now then, how do we receive of this?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.360]   And I'm suggesting that obviously the first thing we've got to do is to see how there
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.040]   were certain respects in which it was quite essential that this fullness that is in him
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.080]   should be exercised on our behalf.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.600]   And we've been doing that in detail.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.840]   We've considered what he did while he was here in this world.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.760]   We've considered what he did on the cross, what he did when he was buried in the grave,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   how he rose out of it, what he did in his ascension, and what he did in his entry into
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.520]   the everlasting and eternal glory.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.560]   We've seen how he's presented his own blood.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.000]   We've seen how he's ratified the covenant.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.800]   We've seen how he there is interceding and acting as an advocate.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.840]   And we've seen how he is there seated at the right hand of God as the Lord of history.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.620]   That was the thing which we were dealing with last Sunday morning.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.820]   And what a comforting thing it is that with the world as it is, to know that all authority
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:19.080]   and power are in the hands of our representative, the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom all this fullness
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   dwells.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.800]   And the point was, of course, that were it not for this fullness, he would not be the
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   Lord of history.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.080]   He was the only one, you remember, in heaven or earth, or in the sea or under the earth,
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.040]   who was strong enough to take the book and to break loose the seals and to open the book.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.640]   He alone is capable of being the Lord of history, and that is because of this eternal fullness
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.040]   that dwells in him.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.640]   Now having come to that, we go on to point out this morning that there is still one other
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.160]   great function which he exercises on our behalf.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.920]   There is one other respect, if you like, in which it was essential that he should have
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.960]   this fullness in order to deal with the problem of our salvation.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   That's what it comes to.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.360]   You see, we've got to keep in your minds, as we consider every one aspect of these different
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.720]   outworkings of his fullness, we've got to keep in mind our own state and condition,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.920]   not only in condemnation, but in bondage to sin and Satan, the world, the flesh, the devil,
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.440]   all our weakness, all our failure.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.500]   We need this fullness because of that.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.880]   And I'm indicating that there were certain things that he had to do, and which he alone
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:54.440]   could do, in order to deliver us from this thralldom, this serfdom, this bondage to sin
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.600]   and to Satan, in which we all are by nature.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.480]   And every time, the thing to bear in mind is that it is his fullness that enabled him
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   to do it.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.520]   Now, I say there is one further matter that we've got to put in under this heading of
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:20.480]   his fullness as exercised on our behalf, because this is the astounding thing.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.920]   Everything he did, he did on our behalf.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.800]   All the action of our Lord in his leaving the courts of heaven, the self-emptying of
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.920]   his signs of his eternal glory, and all he did here on earth, it is all done on behalf
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   of his people.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.640]   It's done as our representative.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.200]   It's done on our behalf.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.720]   And so is this final matter to which I've got to call your attention under this heading.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.280]   What is it?
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:59.600]   Well, it is the sending of the Holy Spirit upon the Church and upon the individual believer.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.560]   Now, this is obviously something which is of supreme importance.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:16.240]   That is why so much space and attention is given to it in the New Testament itself.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.080]   Because ultimately, we cannot truly receive of his fullness and manifest it and make it
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.920]   evident that that is the case, unless this particular operation of the Holy Spirit takes
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.440]   place with respect to us.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.480]   And of course, this again is one of the most practical aspects of the matter, and again
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:46.680]   one of the most thorough tests which we can ever apply to ourselves.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.120]   The thing we always should be doing as Christian people is to test and examine ourselves in
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.940]   the light of this New Testament picture of the Christian man.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.760]   We must never be looking at ourselves in the light of this portrait, this portrayal that
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:08.920]   we have of the early Church, and of the continuation of the life of the early Church as far as
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.760]   it is recorded here in the pages of the New Testament.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.920]   And of course, we can supplement that by looking at the history of the Church in certain special
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.600]   periods.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   And again, we must examine ourselves in the light of that.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.840]   There is nothing that I know of that is more important at the present time.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   Indeed, my whole object and intent in calling your attention to this particular text, the
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.720]   sixteenth verse of the first chapter of John's Gospel, and all that we did last year in considering
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:47.880]   the prologue, my ultimate object and intent is simply this, that the present-day Church
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.200]   may realize what she should be.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:59.760]   Now, I am one of those who is much more worried about the Church than about the world.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.520]   And my reason for that is this, of course, that there is no hope for the world unless
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.000]   the Church is right.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.840]   The world can't put itself right.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.200]   That's obvious.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.480]   Never more obvious than today.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.200]   The only hope for the world is through the Church.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.720]   That's always been the case.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.200]   That's the whole message of the Bible.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.080]   God has chosen to make the Church the guardian and the custodian of the truth.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   We are stewards of the mysteries.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   The world is bankrupt.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   It's got nothing.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.960]   It can't have anything.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.560]   And the only hope for it is this message.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.320]   Well then, the great question that arises is, is the Church presenting this message?
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.880]   And when I say the Church, of course, I mean not only those who preach and who are responsible
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.040]   for government in the Church, but I mean every single member of the Church.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.680]   You see, the remarkable thing about the book of the Acts of the Apostles is that not only
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.480]   did you have the preaching of the Apostles, but you had the witness and the testimony
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.840]   of the common people, those who had become Christian.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.280]   We are told in chapter 8 that they were all scattered abroad from Jerusalem.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   The only people left in Jerusalem seemed to be the Apostles.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.680]   All the members of the Church had been scattered abroad by a persecution.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.380]   And we are told that they went everywhere preaching the Word.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:25.160]   That means not that they stood up and of necessity addressed large congregations.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.400]   Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the Word.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.920]   Somebody says that should be translated "gossiping it," just telling people about it, telling
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.520]   people why they were what they were, why they'd been persecuted, why they'd had to leave
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.720]   Jerusalem.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.320]   And there is no doubt at all.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.400]   But that it was this combined action of the preaching of the Apostles, plus the changed
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:54.520]   lives of these people, that led to this tremendous impact which the early Church had upon the
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.800]   world at that time.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   The kind of thing that we read about in the second chapter of Acts this morning.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.840]   You see, something had happened to these people and everybody was amazed and they all came
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.920]   running together to look at these people, this phenomenon that had taken place as the
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.440]   result of what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.000]   Now, that's something that has been repeated regularly throughout the long history of the
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.440]   Christian Church.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.320]   The moment the Church approximates to this condition in the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.720]   the world always becomes interested.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.960]   I know of nothing which is more pathetic about the present situation than the way in which
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:40.560]   the various sections of the Christian Church have set up publicity agencies to advertise
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.520]   the Church.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.880]   I think it is the final confession of bankruptcy and of a complete failure to understand the
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.320]   doctrine of the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.040]   The Church is arguing today like this.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.800]   She says, "Well, of course, in business they only succeed as the result of advertising."
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   And they say, "The trouble is today that the people don't know about the Church.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.920]   The people don't know about the Church.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.760]   Therefore we must buy columns in newspapers in order to tell them about the Church, what
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.600]   she is and what she does."
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.040]   That's what we've come to.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:18.180]   You see, in the book of the Acts, it was the people who advertised the Church.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.840]   In every revival, it's the people who advertise the Church.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.600]   And nothing can ever advertise the Church except the people, the members of the Church.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.480]   You'll never do this by advertising.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.080]   The world knows all that the advertisements can tell them.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.120]   They know it all already.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:40.160]   What the world is waiting to see is that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.760]   And it will only see that in people.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.880]   It's no use the Church saying that.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.000]   What's the use of a man like myself standing in a pulpit and saying, "The gospel is the
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.160]   power of God unto salvation."
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.360]   And then the man in the street comes to me and says, "Well, I know those people who
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.920]   listen to you, and I don't see much power about them.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.200]   What's the value of my preaching?
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.480]   What's the value of my taking a page in the Times and saying, 'The Church has got tremendous
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   power.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.000]   She's got a gospel that changes the lives of men and makes them more than conquerors,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.120]   fills them with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.360]   I put in my advertisement.'"
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.240]   And people will write to the Times and say, "Well, where are these people?
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.040]   Where are the people who manifest what you've said in your advertisement?"
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.480]   Now that's the kind of thing that I've got in my mind.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.880]   We must start with ourselves, my friend.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.440]   There's no doubt about this.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.840]   The majority of the people of this country are outside the Church today because of what
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.440]   they think about the Christian Church.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.840]   And why do they think that about the Christian Church?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.920]   They think about it because of what they see.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.440]   They mix with Christian people.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.440]   And they say, "You say one thing, but we don't see that in evidence in your lives.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.880]   We don't see it in practice."
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.600]   And it's a perfectly fair criticism to make.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.640]   Now, we are concerned about this whole question because here is the only key to our own need
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.880]   and the need of the whole world.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:14.200]   Of His fullness have all we received, and grace upon grace, is it evident?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:21.880]   Now then, I say that it's just at this very point that this whole matter of the Holy Spirit
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.120]   comes in so prominently and so powerfully.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.080]   Because as I'm going to show you now, these apostles, these disciples, were already in
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.200]   the Christian Church before the day of Pentecost.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.540]   But they were very useless.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:43.240]   And it was only as the result of this that they became the power that we know about.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.000]   They became such people so that it was said of them that they were turning the world upside
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   down.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.080]   And as an actual fact, they did that.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.400]   And the world has never been the same ever since.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.160]   But now then, it was all as the result of this.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.480]   Let me put it to you like this, therefore.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:12.600]   The last action, I say, which our Lord took in virtue of His inherent eternal fullness
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:20.440]   was to obtain for us this blessing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.500]   Now let me put it to you like this.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:30.200]   Take first of all the Old Testament witness and testimony with respect to this.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   I want to prove this matter.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:38.120]   I want to prove that it was only because He had that fullness that our Lord was able to
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.720]   do this for us, and that nobody else could.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.080]   Now then, take the Old Testament witness to this and its prophecy concerning this.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:54.160]   You notice the very phrase that was used in that first chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.860]   of the Apostles.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:01.140]   We read in the fourth verse of the first chapter, "And being assembled together with them,
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:10.140]   our Lord commended them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:16.020]   of the Father, which saith he, You have heard from me."
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.540]   The promise of the Father.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.540]   Right.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.220]   Here there is therefore a promise which has been made by God the Father with respect to
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.440]   this particular thing.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:33.820]   You get the same idea exactly in that phrase that the Apostle Paul uses in the first chapter
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:40.820]   of Ephesians and in the thirteenth verse, "In whom also having believed, ye were sealed
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.700]   with that Holy Spirit of promise."
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.180]   Same thing.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.260]   The Holy Spirit that has been promised.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.580]   The promised Holy Spirit.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.340]   That is what it means.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:57.660]   In other words, these references, both of them, point back to what we read of in the
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.660]   Old Testament.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:04.900]   Let me just give you a few illustrations of what had been promised under the Old Testament
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.900]   dispensation.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.580]   Take, for instance, what you get in the book of the Prophet Isaiah, chapter 4, verses 1
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.580]   to 3.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:17.020]   "Yet now, hear, O Jacob my servant and Israel, whom I have chosen.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.820]   Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb which will help thee.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:30.660]   Fear not, O Jacob my servant, and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen, for I will pour water
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.860]   upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground."
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:41.100]   There are some people who will postpone the whole of that to some imaginary millennium.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.480]   My dear friends, this is a promise to the Christian Church.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.180]   This is a prophecy of what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:54.100]   "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:00.220]   I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring."
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:06.460]   Now, that is one of the prophecies that our Lord was referring to, one of the prophecies
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:11.300]   that John the Baptist was referring to, one of the prophecies that the Apostle Paul was
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.980]   referring to also in his teaching.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.120]   These prophecies of the coming of the Spirit are the ones that were fulfilled on the day
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   of Pentecost.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.580]   Or take it again in Isaiah 59, where there is another wonderful and great and glorious
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.660]   statement in the twenty-first verse.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:37.340]   "As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:43.580]   My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:49.540]   out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed-seed,
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:55.220]   saith the Lord from henceforth and for ever."
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:02.220]   And you get an elaboration of that in chapters 60 and 61 of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.060]   "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath appointed me to preach good
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.460]   tidings unto the meek, etc., and then there follow the blessings.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.060]   He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:22.180]   opening of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.740]   and other great promises."
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.820]   Beauty for ashes!
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:31.340]   What a wonderful picture of the blessings of the Christian salvation, and so on.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.020]   But let me read to you perhaps what is the most important of all these Old Testament
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:42.020]   prophecies, namely in the 36th chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel, beginning
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.020]   at verse 27.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.500]   Or perhaps we had better go back to verse 25.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:53.780]   "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.340]   From all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:03.420]   A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you."
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.820]   Isn't that great a bit?
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.100]   "And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.100]   of flesh.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.060]   And I will put my spirit within you."
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.100]   That's after the change of heart, you notice.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:22.900]   "I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.140]   my judgments and do them."
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:31.220]   Now, there are frequent references back to that in the New Testament.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:37.780]   The important thing is that having said that he will put a new spirit within us and then
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:46.180]   change the heart, on top of it there is this further giving of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:53.580]   But of course, again, one of the most familiar illustrations of this is the one that is found
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.220]   in the prophet John, the one that was quoted by the apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:05.060]   Here it is, you see, in the second chapter of the prophet Joel, beginning at verse 28.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:12.860]   "And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:18.980]   and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:24.540]   men shall see visions, and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:30.060]   I pour out of my spirit, and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.860]   fire and pillars of smoke, the sun shall be turned into darkness, the moon into blood
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.020]   before that great and terrible day of the Lord come.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:44.980]   And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered,
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.660]   for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.140]   the remnant whom the Lord shall call."
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:22:02.940]   Now, I've only picked out the most notable examples of this Old Testament prophecy concerning
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.620]   this great event which took place on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.460]   Now there's the promise of the Father.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.420]   The Father has promised that a day is going to come when the Spirit shall be poured forth
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:19.980]   in great abundance and assurance on all types and kinds of people, not confined to certain
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:27.100]   chosen leaders, ordinary servants, handmaids, men, women, everybody, young men, old men,
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:33.340]   this great profusion with its accompanying manifestations.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.220]   Now then, there is your Old Testament promise.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.940]   There is the teaching of the prophets.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:46.060]   But let us look at the last of the prophets, whose name was John the Baptist.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.900]   And you will find in this very first chapter of John's Gospel, which we are considering
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:58.180]   together, that John made a very important statement with respect to all this.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.540]   The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, verse 29, "Behold the Lamb
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.920]   of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.620]   This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me; for he
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.940]   was before me, and I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.340]   am I come baptizing with water."
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:25.420]   And John bear record, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove,
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:33.020]   and it abode upon him; and I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:39.500]   (that is to say, God) the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:49.500]   and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.540]   And I saw, and bear record, that this is the Son of God."
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.620]   Now that's a most crucial statement.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.980]   Let's give you a parallel to that, as we find it in the third chapter of the Gospel
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.180]   according to St. Luke.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:08.940]   John is preaching in the wilderness, and all sorts and kinds of people go out to listen
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.180]   to his preaching.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:16.100]   But after he had delivered his sermon, we read this in the fifteenth verse.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:24.340]   And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:32.020]   he were the Christ or not, John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:40.140]   with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the lecher to whose shoes I am not worthy
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:47.780]   to unloose, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, whose fan is in
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:53.260]   his hand; and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:59.740]   garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.460]   I am not the Christ, says John, I am a little man who baptizes you with water.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.900]   He is the one who is going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost, not with water, but with
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.060]   the Holy Ghost and with fire.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.380]   Pointing forward, John says, the promise of the Father is not fulfilled in me.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.220]   This isn't what the Father has promised.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.100]   This is a water baptism.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.780]   The Father has said that one is to come who is going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.980]   I am not he.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.580]   He is the one who is to come.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.980]   I am not worthy to undo the lecher of his shoes.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.540]   But now, over and above all this, we have the most interesting teaching of our Lord
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.020]   himself about this.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.740]   And the comment of the Apostle John upon it.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:52.700]   This is in the seventh chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, verses 37 to 39.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:26:01.940]   During the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:07.820]   man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:16.380]   He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.380]   of living water.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.380]   Now that's the promise.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.100]   That's the sort of thing that ought to be true of every Christian.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.060]   Then John adds in brackets his commentary.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:40.460]   But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, or would
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:52.100]   receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.940]   Now that's a very significant statement.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.740]   Our Lord is repeating the promise of the Father.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.140]   He says this is going to come.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:06.100]   John says he was referring there, he was prophesying, it couldn't happen then, it was going to
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.860]   happen, but it couldn't happen until Jesus was glorified.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:18.100]   And so when you go on to the 16th, 14th, 15th, and 16th chapters of this Gospel according
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.420]   to St. John, you get our Lord elaborating the whole thing.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.620]   Let not your heart be troubled, he believeth.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.780]   God believeth also in me.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.100]   I'm going on.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.700]   And he says it's a good thing, since verse of the 16th chapter, nevertheless I tell you
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.700]   the truth.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:37.300]   It is expedient for you, it's a good thing for you, that I go away.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:42.980]   For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will send
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.980]   him unto you.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.340]   It's a good thing for you that I go away.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.340]   Why?
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.500]   Well he says if I don't go, if I don't die and rise again and be glorified, I cannot
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.360]   send the Comforter upon you.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.060]   But if I go, I will send him unto you, and you will receive of all his great and gracious
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.700]   and glorious blessings.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:08.740]   You see our Lord himself in the days of his flesh is still saying the promise of the Father
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.180]   is yet to come.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.220]   Not yet.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.340]   Even while he's here himself, he can't do this.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.980]   And so you get that most interesting statement which we've already looked at in the first
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.380]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:32.340]   Here is our Lord now, the other side of the resurrection.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.860]   He's being crucified, he died, he was buried, he rose again.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.900]   He's amongst his people during the forty days, and here he is about to ascend into heaven,
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.140]   and he makes this statement to them.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.660]   Being assembled together with them, commended them that they should not depart from Jerusalem,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.380]   but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he, ye have heard of me.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:29:02.340]   For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.260]   Not many days hence.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:12.060]   Then the disciples misunderstand this, you remember, with their carnality and their materialism.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.700]   They're interested in when is the kingdom going to be restored to Israel, and I believe
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.820]   the Christian church is as she is today, very largely because for nearly a hundred years
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.780]   we've been doing very much the same thing.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.220]   We've been waiting for some materialization of the kingdom of God, and we've not been
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.860]   thinking of the promise of the Father.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.020]   Don't you see how we tend to repeat these errors from generation to generation?
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.460]   So he comes back to it.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.100]   He says, but you shall receive power.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.420]   After that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me, both in
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:49.140]   Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.940]   He says you can't be witnesses to me as you are now.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.220]   You know now that I'm the Son of God.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.460]   You've had proof of it in my resurrection.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.980]   He'd manifested himself to them so repeatedly.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.180]   Here are men who've heard all his teaching, acquainted with all his emphases.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.140]   They can be living witnesses you would have thought to the resurrection, but he says you
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.380]   can't.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:16.540]   They can't be true witnesses until they have received this baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:24.260]   Now the deduction we draw therefore from all this is this, and it surely is inevitable,
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:33.420]   that the coming of the Spirit was contingent upon the other work which had to be accomplished
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.140]   by our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:45.220]   Even when he has come into the world filled with the Spirit himself, he cannot give this
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.460]   blessing to the church.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:54.500]   That's the vital importance of John 7, verse 39, and our Lord's own statement here, even
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.380]   after the resurrection.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.620]   He's got to do something further before this blessing can come.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.620]   What's that?
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.220]   Well, it's what we've already been dealing with.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.700]   He's got to ascend into heaven.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.860]   They saw him ascending there on Mount Olivet, the accounts in that first chapter of the
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.740]   book of Acts.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.180]   And he's got to ratify the covenant, he's got to present his own blood, he's got to
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:22.660]   sit down as a sign of the completion of the work, and then and then only does the Holy
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.820]   Ghost come upon the church.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:33.940]   The promise of the Father was fulfilled and carried out upon the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.740]   That is the coming of the promise of the Father.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.420]   He says it's going to come a few days hence.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:45.140]   In ten days' time it actually came upon the Christian church.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:50.300]   This is the fulfillment of the promise of the Father about the outpouring of the Holy
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.300]   Spirit.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.980]   Now then, you remember what happened.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.420]   This was such an amazing phenomenon that the people came together from everywhere and they
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.820]   couldn't understand it.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.100]   And Peter got up and he made that great statement.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:09.220]   Ye men of Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken to my words.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.740]   These are not drunken as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.740]   Well what then?
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:22.140]   Well he says, this is that which was spoken by the prophet John.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.300]   This is the promise of the Father.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.660]   This is the thing that you've been waiting for throughout the centuries.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.220]   At last it has come to pass.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.380]   And then later on in the sermon the apostle makes it abundantly clear about the relationship
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.300]   of these things to one another.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:47.100]   In verse 33 we have this, "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:54.000]   received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.260]   ye now see and hear."
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.420]   That's a crucial statement.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:06.180]   In a sense of course he says the same in verse 38 when he says to the people, "Repent and
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:12.020]   be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.180]   you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:22.460]   For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off, even as many
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.900]   as the Lord our God shall call."
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:33.460]   But the crucial statement is this, "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:42.020]   having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this."
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:50.700]   What it means is this, that when our Lord had returned having completed all his work,
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:57.540]   God the Father gave him as a reward for all that he had done, this gift of the Holy Ghost
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.340]   to give to the church his people.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:06.140]   Now that is the sequence, that is the explanation of what John means in that statement in the
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.980]   39th verse of the 7th chapter.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.260]   The Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.340]   How was he glorified?
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.420]   He was glorified in his death upon the cross, in his resurrection and ascension, in appearing
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.940]   in the presence of God.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:26.820]   And God, as a reward for what he has done, gives him the gift of the Spirit that he in
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.140]   turn may give the gift to his own people.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.540]   Now that or to solve a problem which I am sure many of you have got in your minds, you
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:39.100]   read in the 15th chapter of John's Gospel that it is the Father who is going to send
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.700]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.140]   Of course.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:47.340]   The Father sends the Holy Spirit by giving it to the Son, who in turn sends it upon us.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.620]   The Spirit is sent by the Father and by the Son.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:57.660]   But in that order, it is the reward that is given to our Lord for the work that he has
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.860]   done on our behalf.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:07.540]   The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.860]   Now then, what does all this mean?
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.900]   What is this baptism of the Spirit?
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.500]   I cannot deal with this subject as it should be, exhaustively.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:26.820]   I simply want to pick out what is most vital for our immediate purpose.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:32.740]   Our Lord did on the day of Pentecost what had been promised throughout the centuries.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.740]   He did what John the Baptist said he would do.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:41.700]   He did what he himself had claimed that he would do.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.220]   But what does this mean?
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.140]   The Holy Spirit was not yet.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.620]   The word "given" is added by the translators.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.860]   The Holy Spirit was not yet.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   What does that mean?
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.740]   Well, obviously it does not mean that there was no Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.860]   is the third person in the blessed Holy Trinity, and he has been there forever and forever
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.780]   with the Father and the Son.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:10.500]   It was he who brooded over the face of the deep before the act of creation began.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.980]   Not only that, we see the Holy Spirit operating in the Old Testament.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.820]   David says, "Take not thy Holy Spirit from me."
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.420]   The Holy Spirit is always in the children of God.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.900]   He was in the children of God in the Old Testament.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.780]   He gave people special powers and various gifts.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.740]   There is a great activity of the Holy Spirit to be seen in the Old Testament.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.660]   We are told of John the Baptist, that he was filled with the Spirit from his mother's
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.660]   womb.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.860]   Well, what does this mean then?
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.460]   That is the vital question, and the most urgent and important question.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.940]   Well, obviously it does not mean regeneration, does it?
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.980]   It cannot mean that.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:54.380]   The disciples were regenerate before the day of Pentecost.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.380]   Our Lord several times had referred to them as being not of the world.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.820]   They are his people.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.700]   He says, "Now are you clean through the word which I have spoken unto you."
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.180]   He says in his high priestly prayer, "I pray for them, not for the world."
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.420]   They are already regenerate, and because they were regenerate, he had breathed the Holy
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.460]   Spirit upon them in the upper room.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.580]   You will find the account in the twentieth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.260]   Well, what is this then?
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.620]   It is not regeneration, I say.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.660]   The Old Testament saints were regenerate.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:31.300]   Abraham was as regenerate as any one of us is.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:36.220]   Christians are described in the New Testament as the children of Abraham.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.660]   Let us never forget that.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.140]   We are all the children of faith, and therefore the children of Abraham.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.980]   We are of the seed, the spiritual seed of Abraham.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:51.900]   Let us not forget that we who are Gentiles have simply been added on to this body which
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.700]   belongs to God, to the children of God.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.020]   There were certain people out of Israel, we are added to them.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:04.540]   That the Gentiles might be fellow heirs and of the household of God, together with the
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.340]   children of God amongst the Jews, the ancient people.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.940]   So it cannot mean regeneration.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:16.980]   And as I say, the disciples were already regenerate before the day of Pentecost.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.980]   Well what is it then?
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.700]   Well, what it means is this.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.340]   The very words, surely, should make it plain and clear to us.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:30.300]   The Spirit had been given before, but not in this sense.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.340]   That is what it means.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.340]   This is a new sense.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.260]   The Spirit was known in the Old Testament, and men knew the operation of the Spirit.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.500]   Yes, but He had never been given in this profusion.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:48.340]   The Spirit shall be poured forth, says Ezekiel, and Joel says exactly the same thing.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.620]   It is only a matter of degree.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:56.300]   The difference between the Old Testament saints and the New Testament saints is purely one
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.260]   of degree.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.980]   They were saints as we are.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.420]   They were children of God, exactly as we are.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.420]   What is the difference?
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:09.100]   Oh, the difference is the degree to which we can receive the Spirit.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.220]   Now let me quote you one of the Puritans, George Hutchison.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.140]   He puts this very well, I think, in his commentary on John's Gospel.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:23.020]   He says, "Not in respect of his personal subsistence," he is referring to John's
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:32.460]   statement in John 7, verse 39, "but in respect of the measure of his gift and graces
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.300]   to be poured out upon believers.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:43.660]   It doth relate partly to the times of the law, and teacheth that albeit believers under
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:51.900]   the law did partake of the Spirit in some measure, yet all that is nothing in comparison
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.740]   of the measure which is poured out under the Gospel."
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.300]   That is the answer.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.020]   That is the answer.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.660]   It is purely a question of measure, of abundance.
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.260]   David knew what it was to have the Spirit of God in him.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.900]   That is why he says, "Take not thy Holy Spirit from me."
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.900]   Other men knew.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.900]   The prophets knew.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.620]   Then they prophesied and so on.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.980]   But the one difference is this.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.260]   Joel says, you know, in this great day which is coming, it isn't going to be something
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.820]   partial.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.300]   It isn't going to be something in a sense exceptional.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:30.940]   The Spirit is going to be poured forth in great profusion, in a mighty abundance, upon
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.540]   all sorts and kinds.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.980]   It will be astounding and exceptional.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.460]   Ordinary people will be speaking the things of God.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.780]   It will be a phenomenon such as the world has never seen before.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.260]   It is the degree.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.220]   It isn't that there was none before and that it has come now.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.220]   No, no.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:56.020]   It is the difference between a little and a great profusion and a great abundance.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.140]   And of course, what we have described in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:06.940]   the Apostles surely ought to make this quite plain and clear to us.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:13.300]   The disciples before this day of Pentecost believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.940]   They knew who he was.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.100]   He himself had expounded to them in the upper room the meaning of his death.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.100]   He had explained the atonement to them.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.860]   He had explained everything to them.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.140]   You will read the account in the 24th chapter of Luke's Gospel.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.820]   They were full believers.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:35.540]   They were regenerate men and they understood the way of salvation.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.980]   But they were not the men that they were after the descent of the Holy Ghost upon them.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:45.580]   They became different men when they were baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:50.580]   It is only then they rarely become witnesses, living witnesses.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.260]   He says, "Stay where you are until the promise comes upon you.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:59.500]   Then and only then will you be able to be true witnesses to me."
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.220]   Now this is a very important point, you see.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.780]   As I said earlier, you would have thought that these men were already in a perfectly
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.300]   fit condition to be witnesses.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   They had been with him.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.900]   They had heard everything he had said.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.780]   They had seen his miracles.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.100]   They had seen him crucified, dead, buried.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.100]   They had seen him risen.
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.860]   They had even touched him and heard him again in his expositions.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.340]   Why you would have said, "These are the men to be witnesses, to testify."
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:31.940]   But now, he says, you need the Holy Ghost and his power upon you.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:39.140]   You need this extra something before you can be true witnesses unto me.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:46.280]   They had received the Spirit when he breathed the Spirit upon them in that upper room.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   You remember the incident.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:54.640]   It is the most important one.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.540]   He said unto them, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:04.460]   When he had said this, John 20, 22, "When he had said this, he breathed upon them, and
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.380]   saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.700]   But even that was not sufficient.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:19.180]   What it means is this, that you and I can be Christians with the Holy Ghost in us.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.220]   For no man can be a Christian without the Holy Ghost.
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.700]   If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:34.900]   You can be a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost within you, and yet know
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:45.660]   very little about this fullness, this grace upon grace, this abundance, this abandon,
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:51.340]   this joy unspeakable and full of glory, this thing that gives people an absolute assurance
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:56.580]   as it gave these people in the day of Pentecost, and a fearlessness and an ability to witness.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:02.660]   That is the manifestation of the fullness.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.500]   There it is before us in the New Testament.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:16.060]   And you will see this in the subsequent history of the Church in every great period of revival.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:21.580]   The moment the Holy Spirit is poured forth again, people who had been ordinary Christians
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:25.620]   become extraordinary Christians.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:31.100]   They become filled with a joy and an abandon and a knowledge and a certainty and a spirit
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.820]   of praise such as they had never had before.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.500]   They were truly Christian before.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.620]   But now there is this fullness.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:42.380]   It is a matter of degree, as George Hutcheson puts it, and as other of the Puritans taught
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.780]   in the same manner.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:52.260]   But you get it not only in revivals, you get it in the lives of individual saints throughout
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.180]   the long history of the Christian Church.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:45:04.940]   My dear friends, the Lord Jesus Christ, because of the fullness that resided in him, was able
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:10.660]   to purchase for us this blessing of the fullness of the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.260]   It is a part of his fullness.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.980]   But you see, if he had not had this fullness, if he had not been able to conquer the devil,
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:22.780]   to live obediently to the law, to die and bear the punishment of our sins, to rise and
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.380]   conquer death in the grave, and do all he did when he entered heaven, he would never
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.300]   have been able to give us this.
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:38.100]   But because of his fullness, it is possible for us to receive of the fullness in this
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.780]   way and manner.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:47.100]   You will know then, there we have completed the evidence with respect to the things that
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:52.900]   our Lord has done on our behalf.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:46:00.020]   This baptism of the Spirit would not be available were it not for his fullness.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:06.700]   But because of his fullness, it has become available.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.540]   And so the question we ask ourselves as we close this morning is the same question that
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:16.820]   we asked at the beginning.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.940]   Are we like these New Testament Christians?
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:27.860]   Is there evidence in us of this fullness, his fullness?
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:34.700]   Do we proclaim and testify to the fact, are we witnesses to the fact, that his fullness
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:41.460]   has purchased for us the fullness of the Holy Spirit?
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.020]   He said you should be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.700]   Then we read in Acts 2, they were all filled with the Spirit.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:52.620]   That means they were baptized with the Spirit, and it was obvious to everybody.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:47:02.860]   Is it obvious to everybody that we have received of his fullness and grace upon grace?
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:09.020]   God willing, we will go on with this next Sunday morning.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:12.940]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
