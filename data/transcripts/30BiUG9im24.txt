[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   It actually turns out that younger generations are more cynical and less trusting than older generations.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.180]   Among Gen Z, only 18% of people believe that most folks can be trusted, most of humanity can be trusted,
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.480]   for a couple of reasons that I'm speculating here.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.900]   One, that they're the most online generation that we have, at least that are adults.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.200]   And two, that we've taught them to be cynical.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.320]   Older adults, parents for instance, think that their kids will thrive if they believe the world is dangerous and competitive.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.240]   And so we instill those beliefs in our kids.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.700]   We tell them all about terrible people they should avoid and make them feel as though strangers are dangerous
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.540]   and that they need us watching them all the time to avoid being kidnapped, for instance.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.040]   And of course there are real dangers in the world.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.680]   But when we emphasize them this much to our kids, to our students, to the younger people in our lives,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.240]   we end up shrinking their worlds, which I don't think actually is very good for them at all.
