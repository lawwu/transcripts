[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.920]   And a longtime listener to this podcast, Romella, wants confirmation on something that she's
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.680]   beginning to sense in Scripture and from listening to what we've been saying on this podcast
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.680]   over the years.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.000]   Romella asks this, "Pastor John, is it true that nothing ever takes God by surprise?"
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.560]   Yes, that's true.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.160]   God is never surprised.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   To be surprised, you have to be uncertain about what's coming.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.000]   You have to be ignorant.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   God is never ignorant about the future or about anything.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.200]   He is never uncertain about what is coming.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.900]   And we can know this for at least two reasons.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.720]   One is that the Bible shows that knowing the future, even the future of human decisions,
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.280]   is part of what it means to be God.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.320]   And the other is that the Bible shows that God's foreknowledge is not the knowledge of
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.040]   something different from His will and plan, but that He knows the future because He plans
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.240]   the future.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.560]   So let's look at those one at a time and passages to support them.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.440]   Isaiah 41, 22.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.080]   God calls the idols.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.000]   He calls them to give an account, and He challenges them to show that they are God's.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   How does He do it?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.920]   Like this, "Announce to us what is coming.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.440]   Declare the things that are going to come afterward, that we may know that you are God's."
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.920]   What does that mean?
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.640]   In other words, in God's mind, the capacity to predict the future belongs to God as God.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.880]   It was part of His deity to be able to declare things that come afterwards.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.840]   He makes the same point in Isaiah 42, 8.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.200]   He connects the power to foreknow and divine glory.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.160]   "I am the Lord, that is my name.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.640]   I will not give my glory to another nor my praise to graven images.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.880]   Behold, the former things have come to pass.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.960]   Now I declare new things before they spring forth.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.440]   I proclaim them to you."
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   So you see the connection.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.720]   "I am Yahweh, and this is part of my divine glory.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.040]   Before they spring forth, I proclaim them to you.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.400]   Foreknowledge, knowledge of the future, is part of my glory," He says.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.320]   Here it is again, Isaiah 45, 21.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.780]   God throws up the challenge of whether there is any other God besides Him, and He does
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.560]   it by asking about their powers to announce the future.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.200]   "Declare," He says, "set forth your case.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.240]   Indeed, let them consult together.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.520]   Who has announced this from of old?
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.480]   Who has long ago declared it?
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.720]   Is it not I, the Lord?
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.680]   And there is no other God besides Me, a righteous God and a Savior.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.360]   There is none except Me."
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.600]   So here it is again.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.240]   God says that what's at stake in His capacity to announce the future affairs of men and
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.080]   nations, that's a lot of human decision, what's at stake is His divinity, His godness.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.520]   "I, the Lord, there is no other God besides Me when I predict the future.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.320]   I show that."
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.760]   And then, this is really important, I think, in settling issue, then we see Jesus do the
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.520]   very same thing as God.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.080]   He connects His foreknowledge, even His knowledge of sinful choices like Judas' sinful choice
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.240]   and Peter's sinful choice to deny Him.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:02.680]   He connects that with His deity, just like Isaiah did with God's deity in John 13, 19,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.200]   where he says at the Last Supper, "From now on, I am telling you before it comes to pass,"
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.520]   he's referring to Judas' betrayal, "I'm telling you about Judas' betrayal before it comes
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.680]   to pass so that when it does, you may believe that I am."
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   Period.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.760]   Now, most of the English translations say that "I am he," which is understandable because
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.840]   it sounds odd to just, "that you may believe I am."
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.320]   That's what the Greek says.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.640]   And we know where that phrase "I am" comes from.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.720]   It's a play on the name of God from Exodus 3.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.520]   "I am who I am.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.400]   Tell them I am sent you."
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.200]   Jesus is claiming to be God, and the basis of it is, "I know Judas is going to betray
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   me."
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   This is huge.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.360]   So, the same thing is true of Peter's denial.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.560]   Jesus knows precisely who will deny Him.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.920]   He knows how many times He will deny Him.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.600]   He knows when in the morning He will deny Him.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.360]   Same thing with Judas—when, where, why.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.120]   And He knew this about Judas from the beginning.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.880]   We know that from John 6, 64.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.560]   I knew from the—when He chose Judas, He knew what He would do.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:35.000]   Now, here's the text that connects the prediction of God with the planning or the performing
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   of God.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.360]   Let's say of 46.9, "I am God, and there is no other.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.160]   I am God, and there's none like Me, declaring"—now, here's His foreknowledge—"declaring
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.640]   the end from the beginning."
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   So He declares it.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.640]   He knows it.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   And then He goes on.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:57.760]   "And from ancient times, things not yet done, saying, 'My purpose will stand, and
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   I will accomplish all My good pleasure.'"
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.920]   So now we get a window onto how God knows the future.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.280]   He knows it because He plans it and does it.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.400]   He knows it because He plans it and performs it.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.680]   Jeremiah 1, 12, the Lord said, "I am watching over My word to perform it."
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.440]   God doesn't just predict.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.280]   He does what He predicts.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:32.400]   Or Ezekiel 12, 25, "For I am the Lord, I will speak the word, I will speak it, and
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.640]   I will perform it."
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.680]   I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord God.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.720]   In other words, God knows the future because He performs the future.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:55.000]   He's never surprised because He's not surprised at His own work.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.080]   Foreknowledge is not an awareness of what the fates will make happen.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.640]   Foreknowledge is not an awareness of what random chance is going to bring about.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.280]   Foreknowledge is not an awareness of what ultimate human autonomy is going to produce.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.440]   There is no fate.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.060]   There is no random chance.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.280]   There is no ultimate human autonomy.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.760]   What God knows is what God will do.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.720]   The future is not some kind of freewheeling reality separate from God's will that He has
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.760]   to try to catch on to and adapt to.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:41.320]   He knows the future because He plans the future, and He's never surprised by what He plans.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.760]   Profoundly true from Scripture and a deep personal comfort to know that God is in sovereign
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.280]   control and in His reign over His creation.
