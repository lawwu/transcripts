[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and happy holidays. I love this time of the year
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:13.280]   Not only because the kids are running around and so happy to open presents feel very grateful to have them and to see their joy
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.280]   But it's also a great time to reflect
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.120]   You know
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.340]   I just sent an email response to someone who had emailed me five times asking me to do something right?
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.400]   It's business development stuff
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.800]   And when I responded I got his out of office email that said he'll be out of the office until January 10th
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.320]   2022 and I'll say to myself Wow
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.940]   You can do biz dev now by setting auto blast emails to random people while you go on vacation
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.940]   How cool is that sign me up?
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.620]   And then the second thing I realized is man
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.040]   If you can do a little bit of work or just a normal amount of work during the holidays
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.820]   You will get far ahead far further than your peers once they come back
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.680]   so in this episode I want to share my
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.100]   2022 housing market
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.940]   Forecasts and this is really important to me because I have tremendous skin in the game about 65% or roughly
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.680]   $200,000 of our passive income comes from real estate without real estate
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.960]   I'm not so sure I would have left work in 2012 and I'm not so sure my wife would have left work in
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.680]   2015 real estate has been so important on our financial journey that I really can't afford to get my
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.940]   2022 housing market forecast to wrong
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.440]   I wish I was just paid to pontificate on where the housing market will be going without any kind of
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.360]   Repercussions right whether it goes up or down and I'm right or wrong
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.600]   It doesn't really matter but getting my forecast right really does matter for our livelihood
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.620]   Because it helps us stay at home to take care of our kids and do what we want
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.800]   So if you are a real estate investor or you're thinking about getting long real estate
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.600]   This podcast is for you and I try to be as honest as possible
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.080]   And if you have bearish views if you have very bearish views
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.840]   I'd love to hear because it's so important to try to elucidate my blind spots because I believe
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.360]   2022 is going to be another great year for housing specifically for the median home price
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.360]   I think it's gonna go up another eight to ten percent now that is down from
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.640]   2021's increase of about 17 to 19 percent, but that was an unprecedented gain in 2021
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   And I don't think it's gonna happen again
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.240]   But eight to ten percent is still huge because historically real estate or the housing market has gone up closer to around
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.560]   Four four and a half percent a year. So we're still talking about roughly twice the
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.000]   Historical price appreciation growth rate and from a cash on cash return basis
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.880]   Let's say you put down 20% and the housing market goes up another 10%
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   And we're talking about a 50% increase in returns on your cash
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.680]   And then of course you've got to deduct all the relative expenses and so forth
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.160]   But the gains are pretty huge and it's another reason why I like real estate so much
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.880]   So let me share 11 reasons. I've come up with as to why
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:19.160]   2022 will be another strong year for the housing market first reason low and negative real mortgage rates
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.000]   I predict mortgage rates won't go up by more than
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.080]   0.375 percent in 2022 in other words your typical three point one two five percent thirty or fixed mortgage
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.240]   Might go up to three point five percent, which is still very low further
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.400]   It's still a negative real mortgage rate
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.800]   I think we're gonna come down from six point eight percent inflation in 2021 to roughly four percent or so in 2022
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.520]   but four percent
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.160]   Inflation and a three point five percent mortgage still means you're getting kind of paid a half a percent to borrow money
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.440]   Therefore there will still be a large amount of incentive to borrow as much money as possible
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.920]   Responsibly possible to buy real assets such as real estate - we're facing a permanently higher demand curve
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.760]   We know that as prices go down demand goes up, but when you see a demand curve shift up
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.440]   Shift up you are seeing demand is higher at all price points
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.760]   And why is that it's because the world has changed the world has permanently changed where there's no going back
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.600]   To going to the office five days a week. It's gonna be work from home or it's gonna be hybrid work from home
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   I've spoken to many employees
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.640]   Several CEOs who are mulling their work and office process for 2022 and they're all saying we're gonna be doing the hybrid
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.960]   Or work from home for a lot longer
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.760]   Further the adoption of real estate as an investment is growing
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.800]   No longer are people just happy to own their primary residence right in the past
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.920]   You just buy your home and you live in it and then you invest in stocks
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.520]   now more and more people are looking at homes real estate as a viable way to make passive income and
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.760]   Gains profits, right? So one person one home or one family one home. That's no longer the multiplier
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   It's one family maybe
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.920]   1.5 homes or 1.2 homes, right?
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.400]   Because people are deciding to buy more and more homes to build their passive income portfolio
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.000]   And then finally the millennial generation is some 72 plus million people strong
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.400]   So this generation will be buying homes in droves over the next 10 20 years
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.120]   It's just the same as it ever was we get older. We start families. We have children
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.280]   We want shelter and in this day and age, we want more shelter for exercise rooms and offices
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000]   3. Increased demand from domestic institutional investors
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.720]   technology
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   innovation demand
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.640]   These three things are making it easier for retail investors to invest with domestic
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.720]   Institutional investors, right? We are seeing a huge growth in the real estate
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.600]   private syndication platform market real estate crowdfunding market and they are
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.840]   Attracting more and more assets one of the easiest examples I can point you to is fund rise
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.760]   One of the leading real estate institutional investors in early 2021 around April
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.240]   It had about a hundred fifty thousand investors on its platform by the end of the year
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   the platform grew to over two hundred fifty thousand investors, therefore the assets under management have grown and
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.680]   Anybody can invest on that platform if they have ten dollars
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.000]   So this is gonna only continue on fund rise and many of the other platforms
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.200]   They're gonna garner more and more assets that will be unleashed into the property market
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.680]   Investors now account for roughly a quarter of all resale and new transactions
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:00.720]   That's nationwide and I expect this percentage to grow even if Zillow did blow themselves up due to bad pricing estimates in
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:08.600]   2021 for increased demand from foreign investors. This folks is the biggest X factor
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.280]   Nobody's talking about I haven't seen any
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.720]   Economist or research analyst nobody talking about what happens if foreign real estate demand comes back with inventions
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:27.160]   One of the best things that has happened from the pandemic is that it has throttled foreign institutional demand since early 2020
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.760]   By my calculations, there's roughly two hundred billion dollars of pent-up foreign demand for US property
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.040]   And I believe that demand will first hit the coasts and then work its way inward
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.800]   pre pandemic around
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   2017 2018 I
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.600]   Witnessed many foreigners beat out many competitive home bidding situations here in San Francisco
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.960]   Many wealthy foreigners would simply buy up homes and leave them empty for years to park cash one of my neighborhood homes
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.340]   I think it was sold for two point one million or something back in 2017
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.200]   It's still empty four years later folks
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:12.200]   So their disinterest in renting out their home for income, which is what most domestic real estate investors
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Do is a testament to how attractive?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.280]   foreigners view US assets, okay, let's move on to point number five a
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.960]   Revaluation of US property on the world stage
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:31.520]   anybody who has ever researched overseas real estate markets knows how cheap US real estate is for a developed country and
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.940]   The sad and funny thing is foreign investors know this they know this they watch US TV
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.160]   They are fascinated with our culture, but Americans we don't know this
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.760]   Most Americans don't appreciate how good we've got it because most Americans have not lived overseas
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.640]   Once you live overseas folks, you really will oh my gosh, so appreciate American living
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.720]   You'll probably eat healthier. You'll probably appreciate your health overall more
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:04.000]   You probably won't rail as much against people in power. I think it's just a perspective thing
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.540]   But I'm telling you folks as someone who grew up in six different countries
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.420]   Worked in international equities for 13 years and traveled to over 60 countries so far
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:18.560]   US real estate is cheap and our country is the greatest country in the world and let's never
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:26.700]   Forget that and take our ability to live in the United States for granted eight strong stock market gains
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.720]   Just look at your 401k IRA Roth IRA
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:37.120]   Whatever tax advantage retirement account you have from three years ago to now it is up probably way more than 50%
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.960]   Then look at your taxable portfolios also way up and over the past three years. It's been a huge
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:51.240]   Anomaly right the S&P 500 generally averages around 10% but in 20 what 19 we saw
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.300]   27 28 percent in 2020 we saw about
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.520]   16 17 percent and in 2021 we're at around 27 28 percent
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:08.400]   I mean those are massive gains where some of the profits will simply flow to buying real assets or they'll get
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.040]   spent on
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.480]   experiences and things because anybody who has been investing since the 1997 Asian financial crisis
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:24.280]   2000 dot-com bubble and the 2008 2009 global financial crisis knows to always convert some of your gains some of your paper
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:31.000]   Profits into real assets so you can keep those gains for longer and you can actually appreciate them because at the end of the day
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.920]   What is the point of making money in the stock market if you actually don't use the money for a better life?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.560]   Then going back to the world stage the S&P 500 has been a dominant performer
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.640]   for the past three years
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   way outperforming
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   international stock markets in Asia
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:54.880]   Europe and so forth so foreigners again see this and say wow the S&P 500 doing so well the US economy
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.720]   The US government has to be doing something relatively better than us
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   We want to buy more US assets as a result
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.440]   All right, nine strong job and wage growth over the past couple years
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.840]   I think all of us have reflected on what we really want to do for a living
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.320]   what is really going to provide us purpose happiness and meaning and
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:25.440]   Thanks to government benefits a lot of us had this ability to take time off decompress and think what should we do?
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:32.760]   And the common consensus is that we all want better pay better flexibility and more perks and to meet these demands
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.560]   Companies have been forced to pay up. For example, the largest investment banks Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:47.720]   They raised first year analyst starting base salaries from 85,000 to 100 to 110 thousand dollars in the second half of
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.000]   2021 and then of course they have bonuses
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.560]   So this causes a cascade effect for the tech management consulting and other industries who also
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.000]   V for this similar talent pool the latest data I think from
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.400]   2020 shows that the median household income is about sixty eight thousand dollars
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.760]   But I bet when the numbers come out for 2022 since we're forecasting
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.160]   2022 numbers the median household income should be
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   73 maybe seventy five thousand dollars and then so when you compare that income to the median home price, let's say
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:26.840]   three hundred fifty five thousand to four hundred thousand dollars depending on the source you look at it's funny how it's not consistent
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:32.720]   That's still relatively affordable. It's actually really affordable based on where interest rates are. All right ten
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.800]   Rising building costs unless you're absolutely desperate and you have no other choice
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.200]   Nobody will sell you a home at a price that is less than its cost to build and building costs are going up folks
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.840]   Think about supply chain issues lumber prices
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:55.160]   They shot up and then they crashed by like 60 70 80 percent and now they're shooting up another 60 70 80 percent
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.720]   There's a lot of disruption still with input costs and then of course
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   Labor costs are going up as I just said so it costs more to build a home
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.200]   Now than it did a year ago and it'll cost more 12 months from now than today
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.160]   and
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:18.280]   Not only our costs going up the time it takes to remodel and expand is also going up and I think frankly as a person
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.920]   Who is remodeling a home and it's been two years already that could be the greatest cost
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.200]   And so if I turn around and flip my house or try to resell it
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:33.360]   I'm gonna demand a higher price to make up for my higher costs and higher time spent then you multiply this feeling by
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:40.440]   thousands and thousands of other homeowners and remodelers and you can easily see why housing prices will continue to go up and
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.320]   then finally 11th declining supply and inventory
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:51.680]   Right, the combination of rising demand and declining supply will cause home prices to increase further. It's economics 101
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:59.240]   It's worth clicking over to my post to see a chart that shows how much existing inventory for sale has declined
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.720]   I'm gonna looking at this chart from January 1991 to now and the green line is
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.560]   Way below it's like 50% below the lowest of lows since 1991
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:19.600]   Meanwhile existing home sales like transactions are going up and up and up. So this is a very
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:28.560]   combustible combination that should boost home prices further now in terms of where I think there's the greatest opportunity to make the most amount of
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.880]   Money, I actually think the coasts the coastal cities such as New York City
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.120]   Seattle San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Boston
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.680]   I think these cities have a lot of upside
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.960]   these cities these markets underperformed the Midwestern and southern markets for a couple of years as
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.480]   Those markets really took off
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.240]   however
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:58.040]   I think there's gonna be a mean reversion a narrowing or even a flip in certain markets
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:06.840]   Housing markets that have gone up the most but also have the most upcoming supply are most at risk of a slowdown or downturn
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.380]   Housing markets that have gone up the least and also have the least upcoming supply
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.800]   I think are the most attractive and again if foreign real estate demand does come back
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.280]   Which I think it will
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:26.080]   The capital is gonna flood the coastal city markets first because they already see them as cheap and they know
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:33.760]   Where San Francisco New York Los Angeles, San Diego and so forth are and then it'll slowly move inward
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.840]   I still think there will be a continued migration to lower cost areas of the country
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.240]   This is a multi-decade trend that I started talking about in 2016 investing in the heartland of America
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:50.480]   But just like two years of the pandemic has throttled the demand from foreigners two years of the pandemic has also
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:57.600]   Throttled the demand relative demand for big cities if you want to make money if you want to build your network
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:04.760]   You should probably go where the opportunities are the greatest and the opportunities are the greatest in the biggest cities
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:12.000]   This is where you can make an outsized amount of money and then you can relocate if you want to but from my experience
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.680]   Being in San Francisco for the past 20 years is that people make so much money that affordability is not the issue and they build
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.760]   Even more networks and more wealth
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.960]   so I think the under 40 crowd is gonna flock back to the big cities in
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.160]   2022 and
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.000]   Beyond now, let me conclude by saying that no forecast is guaranteed, right?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.480]   But I'll share with you my confidence interval at various levels of appreciation and depreciation
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:45.440]   So I only believe with a 10% confidence. There will be a negative appreciation of housing prices in 2022
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.280]   Therefore I believe with a 90% confidence housing prices will go up in 2022
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.640]   5% appreciation or greater 80% confidence 8% appreciation or greater. This is like my base case 70% confidence
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:05.720]   10% appreciation or greater 60% confidence and another 15 plus percent appreciation or greater
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.120]   I say about 30% we could certainly see high teens price appreciation again in housing
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.880]   this could happen if mortgage rates plummet by 30% foreign demand comes in much higher than expected and
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.320]   favorable real estate tax laws are passed, you know such as
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.920]   abolishing the salt cap deduction and then if the market falters
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.000]   Maybe money flows into real estate as safety or if the stock market explodes higher
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.400]   Maybe more money goes into real estate. So it's like almost the heads. I win tails. I win such an arrow
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.240]   So if you are long real estate
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.120]   Then you should probably hold on to your properties to capture another great year of upside
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.480]   You literally just have to hold on to it rent it out or just enjoy your life in it as a renter
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.320]   You should consider getting neutral real estate by owning your primary residence
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.840]   Just make sure you see yourself living in it for at least five years or longer the longer the better folks
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.200]   And if you don't want to do that, you can invest more strategically in real estate funds
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.560]   REITs and just online real estate so you just gain exposure so you can ride that wave
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.840]   Thanks to just inflation the house you find expensive today
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.280]   Will probably seem reasonable two to three years from now and in ten years
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.120]   You will probably kick yourself for not buying at such a great bargain today
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.840]   You just have to zoom out with your lens zoom in look at it
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.040]   But then zoom out and think what could it be in the future?
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:33.440]   Personally, I am already leveraged up in the real estate market, right? I already bought my forever home in 2020
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.320]   So I can't afford to buy another home without selling assets and I don't want to sell assets because I'm still bullish in
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.120]   2022 and I don't want to incur tax liability. So my next home purchase will likely be
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:50.960]   Three to five years from now, hopefully in Honolulu if all goes according to plan, but things generally don't go according to plan
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.760]   But strategically I'm gonna continue to invest in single-family real estate funds and continue to build my position in
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:05.240]   VNQ the Vanguard real estate index ETF and then I'll invest in single stock real estate names and also
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.320]   Individual real estate syndication deals just to be a little bit more surgical
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.120]   It is really largely due to expected gains in real estate in 2022
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:21.000]   Where I feel comfortable taking things down a notch and you've got to think about your assets your positions as well
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.360]   If your investments go up another eight to ten percent, is it really necessary to work so hard?
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.000]   Well, it depends on how much you want but for us, you know back in 2012
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.400]   I thought I had enough obviously I needed more because I had a family but if real estate goes up another eight to ten percent
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.720]   I just don't feel the need to really grind as hard in 2022 and I think we're all tired, right?
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:50.920]   I'm tired from 2020 2021 and it'd be nice to just relax a little bit more and take it easy
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:58.080]   you know and let me conclude by saying the downside scenario for real estate is probably that prices fall five to ten percent in
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.640]   2022 and this could happen if mortgage rates shoot up by over 1%
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.920]   There's a damaging new law that passes like a self-inflicted wound that a government passes
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:15.480]   and we enter into a recession because suddenly everybody believes all this craziness in the stock market and NFTs and all that is
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.840]   Just one big bubble and when one bubbles burst they burst really quickly
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.760]   So in such a scenario, you know real estate could go down five ten percent
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:33.400]   But if it does I plan to be aggressively buying the dip and I expect other investors to aggressively buy the dip as well
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.080]   So I'd love to hear your thoughts about the housing market for 2022
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.240]   I spent hours thinking about this great time during the holidays and it's really important, right?
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.080]   Because I have skin in the game and I don't want to mess this up
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.440]   So if you're really bearish on the housing market
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   I'd love to hear your point of view. It's so important to see all sides so we can make better decisions going forward
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.640]   Thanks so much everyone if you appreciated this episode and the post love a positive review
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   I read them all and it keeps me going
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.840]   Take care
