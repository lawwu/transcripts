[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.960]   What would you do if you were 29 years old,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.360]   were deeply in debt with over $25,000 of credit card debt, had $200 in your checking account,
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160]   and had five children to support? Where would you start?
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.440]   Would you start with buying and selling stuff on Craigslist?
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:08.240]   [Music]
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.280]   Welcome, my friends. Welcome, radicals. Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.760]   Thursday, September the 11th, 2014. This is episode 59. My guest today is a man named Ryan Finley.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.280]   And yes, that is his story. He paid off $25,000 of credit card debt in four years
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520]   with buying and selling stuff on Craigslist.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.560]   [Music]
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.960]   I'm not sure that's where I would start if I were in that situation, but I certainly was inspired
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.640]   when I first started reading Ryan's story. And I think you'll be inspired after hearing it.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   And there are a number of amazing lessons that we can learn from his experiences. I first heard
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.960]   about Ryan several years ago and started reading his website, which is re-craigslist.com. And today,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.600]   I have for you an in-depth interview with him. And we're going to talk in the beginning about
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.680]   his story, find out what he learned. Then towards the end, we're going to talk through some of his
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.240]   tips for buying and selling stuff on Craigslist, how to get top dollar and how to get deals.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.880]   Remember, this is a man who has made his full-time living on Craigslist, supporting his family
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.520]   for the last four years. So if anybody knows anything about how to get good deals and how
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.080]   to get top dollar, I think he would be a good person to listen to. Enjoy the interview.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.960]   So Ryan, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.040]   Yeah, thanks for having me, Dr.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.760]   I've been looking forward to this chat. I've been reading your site for, man, it's got to be at
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.960]   least a couple of years. I don't know where I first saw it. It might have been your life hacker
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.560]   mention. I don't know how long ago that was. But I have really enjoyed reading your articles. I've
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.040]   learned a lot. I learned about how to pick out a good washing machine. That was a helpful article
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:10.640]   to me. But let's start with, tell us a little bit about your story and how you got started in the
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.320]   Craigslist business. Yeah. So I think it was about four and a half years, something like that, ago.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.560]   I had just gotten my general contractor's license and I really wanted to get into business. But I
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.760]   realized that general contracting in construction just wasn't something that I wanted to do for the
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   long term. And I kind of realized that pretty quickly after getting my contractor's license.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.040]   Anyways, I was just kind of at a rough spot in life at that point. We were deeply in debt. I'd
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.440]   just been trying to figure out what I wanted to do. And finally, I was able to meet, I met with a
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.240]   couple of friends of mine and they basically real pinned me down on it. They told me to pick an idea.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.560]   We talked about a couple of them and then they were just going to kind of help keep me accountable
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.880]   to make sure I stuck with it. And the idea was Craigslist, buying and selling things on Craigslist.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:13.040]   Yeah, that's kind of how it all started. Did you ever know anyone who was making a living on
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.320]   Craigslist? No, I'd never, nor had I ever read about anybody. It was just something that I'd
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.640]   always been fascinated with buying and selling used items, growing up, going to garage sales
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.440]   with my mom. And when you're a young kid, when you're thinking about business, that's all you
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.680]   can think about is like, well, how can I buy and sell a video game to make a little bit of money?
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.000]   And that always fascinated me. So when Craigslist came out, it didn't actually come out in our city,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.960]   which is a huge bummer. When they first started out, it was just in a few cities,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.720]   sprinkled around. But I eventually moved to Portland and that's when I started seeing the
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.400]   potential of the Craigslist marketplace. So you had the idea, I want to buy and sell.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.320]   Craigslist was a useful medium. How did you start? So after that meeting, I met with a couple of
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.600]   Chris and Jason and one morning just met with them. And I had $200 to my name, basically. And
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.520]   basically the assignment was go home. We'd agreed on I needed to make 100 bucks a day profit.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.680]   And I would email them every day, just tell them what I bought, what I sold,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.720]   and how much money I'd made, and how much time I'd spent just to make sure that I was putting
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.160]   in my time. And so I went home that day with my 200 bucks and I had to make $100 profit.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.200]   And so I just jumped on and anything that I knew that I was seeing that was underpriced,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.400]   that I thought I could sell quickly, I would go out and pick it up and bring it back and clean it
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.960]   up and then put it back up for sale. And I was getting free items off the free section. I mean,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.000]   it was a real back against the wall hustle at that point. So...
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.480]   Did you think about just going and getting a job?
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:19.280]   You know, I had to have, I mean, at that point, I'd probably had like 25 plus jobs over my,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:27.040]   you know, through my life. And I just, I didn't want to work for anybody else anymore. I was just
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.520]   kind of tired of it. You know, and it wasn't just about like, I have entrepreneurial blood in me.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.760]   And, you know, I'm constantly thinking of ideas, business ideas, and how to create value and add
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:49.200]   value and looking for opportunities. And, you know, and then I had long term goals, you know,
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.520]   that I was trying to reach to. So...
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.080]   How'd you get into so much debt?
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:04.640]   It was a combination. We'd moved out to Hawaii, and my family and I, and, you know, we had,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.920]   I had a credit card, and we would just put a few expenses per month on it. And what would happen
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.200]   is, is it would just slowly, you know, the balance would slowly creep up or like, an unexpected
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.840]   expense would come up and it would, the balance would go up a little bit higher and
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.480]   I just wasn't super, you know, I wasn't super disciplined. I am, you know, I wasn't saving very
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:43.360]   much. And yeah, so at that point, I would call myself a pretty undisciplined, foolish,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.680]   foolish person with money.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.120]   So you're breathing. You're like all of us, right?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.440]   So what made the switch? Why did you, what happened? What was the chain of events that
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.200]   led you to decide to pay off your debt?
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.720]   Okay, so that's actually a really, really cool story that I haven't really talked to too many
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.440]   people about. So incidentally, it was like five days before that meeting that started the whole
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:20.720]   Craigslist venture. I was approximately 25, actually, yeah, I was approximately $25,000
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.800]   in credit card debt at that point. And some of that, some of that, like I said, was from Hawaii,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:36.080]   some was when we moved back. We had, after we'd moved back, not too long after that, we were able
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:44.320]   to borrow a little bit of money for a down payment and we purchased a house at, we had a great price
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:53.440]   on a house here. But I needed, I bought it with the plan to remodel the basement, to rent it out
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.480]   to a family and I needed to borrow a little bit of money to do that work. And so, some of it was
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.760]   that. So it was, some of it was decent debt, but I'd, unfortunately, I'd put it on like a Home
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:16.160]   Depot card. So anyways, back to the story, five days before I started the Craigslist venture,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   I was, I was basically, I was at my breaking point. It was the rock bottom. I couldn't make
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:29.360]   my minimum payments. I was signed on a mortgage. And I was just, I was at that point where I was
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.720]   just like, I kind of, I lost hope. I was like, nothing's working out. I don't have any business
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   prospects right now. It would just be easier just to walk away from it all. And so, I went out to
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:49.200]   coffee with my friend Jeremy and he sat me down and I told him what I was thinking about doing.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:57.120]   He got a look over him. He basically, he sat me down and he goes, "Ryan, you do whatever it,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.040]   you know, stinking takes, you know, basically, to pay your next payment." And he's like,
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.720]   "Start with your mortgage because you don't want to lose your house. You got renters right now."
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:14.080]   And he basically just encouraged me to pay my next payment and hustle my tail off to,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.000]   to basically to pay the next payment after that. And one, one payment or one debt at a time,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.360]   just to try to stay current. And, and that's what I did. You know, I went home and spent the rest of
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.400]   my money on the, got the mortgage payment paid. And, and then I think, yeah, it was like four
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:38.720]   or five days later, I started the Craigslist thing and, and yeah, that's what started it all.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.640]   And I basically just, it was kind of a blur of months of hustle and started seeing progress,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   like started paying them down, starting to paying the debts down, working really hard.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.720]   And once I, once you start seeing progress and I started reading some financial books,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.160]   yeah, I saw some hope and that was it. I made, I was determined to get out of that at that point.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.640]   And so good for you. Yeah. Did you make the a hundred bucks the first day?
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.960]   I did. Yeah. I still don't remember. I haven't written down what I bought. Maybe it was just
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.880]   like a combination of, you know, I don't know, a couple of piddly little items and,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.480]   but yeah, I made the, I made the a hundred dollars pretty much every day for
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.720]   the first couple of weeks. And, you know, there's one day or here and there
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.040]   after that, that I'd, I'd miss it, but then I'd start going way over.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.400]   And yeah, and, and it started, it went really well. So.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.840]   Let's see. So a hundred bucks a day, were you considering that seven days a week or six days a
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.560]   week? I was doing at the, when I first started, I was, the first couple of weeks, I think I was
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:58.160]   probably working every day. I was taking obviously some time off. Sure. Of course. You know, here and
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.760]   there, you know, cause I have a family, but I was with my back against the wall that much. I was,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.160]   you know, I had to do whatever it took to, you know, to provide for my family and pay bills. So.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.640]   Do you have any sense of, at the beginning, like, were you working 10 hours a day, 12 hours a day,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.840]   any sense of how long a day in a day? It was, it was at least eight to 10 hours a day. Cause
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.480]   eight hours was like, that was my, you know, even though I was working from home buying and selling
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.720]   items, I needed to have a structured schedule, especially to start out with. And yeah, so it
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.920]   was at least eight hours, some more, you know some of the summer months. And I was in the,
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.040]   yeah, the summer months weren't totally, it was like five months later, but yeah.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.720]   Well, it's interesting cause I mean, I'm sure you're probably doing better than a hundred dollars
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.560]   a day now from, from seeing how much debt you paid off and whatnot. I'm sure it's, I'm sure
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.480]   it's an excess of that, but I mean, basically if let's assume that you work 10 hours a day and
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.440]   you're able to make a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars a day getting started, you know, after a
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   few months, then at the low end, that's 10 bucks an hour. And that's, that's again, more than
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:20.880]   minimum wage. Now you obviously need some intelligence and some skill to develop some
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.560]   skill of buying and selling and learning over time. But that was what so impressed me about
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.720]   reading your, about your story is that here's something that is sitting out there. It's a,
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.160]   it's just a medium that everybody has access to. There's no cost to buy or to sell something on
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.520]   Craigslist. And by going out and saying, let me see if I can connect buyers with what they want
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.320]   and sellers with what they want, you're able to create an income source that's in excess of a
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:53.760]   minimum wage, minimum wage starting position. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty, um, and you know,
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.440]   that obviously, uh, you know, as every time you buy and sell something, you learn something. And,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.840]   uh, as time goes on, you start, I began to start learning which items were more profitable,
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:12.640]   which items were in higher demand, which items had more room for me to add value to them. And,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.800]   uh, that's eventually what led me to, to the appliance niche, because, you know, naturally
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.840]   you would like to make more money and work less hours. And, and, you know, I, I think I had one,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   one instance in particular, I had a friend who was helping his friend get rid of a refrigerator.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.640]   And I, I went and picked it up for, uh, it was 150 bucks or something like that, or $175. And,
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.760]   uh, just came home, cleaned it up and reposted it. And it was a nice side-by-side refrigerator.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:50.480]   And I ended up selling it for 500 very, very quickly within a day. And, you know, it doesn't
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.880]   take, you know, when you put that amount of profit in your pocket, after an experience like that,
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:03.200]   where you basically, I probably worked an hour, hour and a half total, um, you know, you, you
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.800]   start realizing the potential of, of that little, of the appliance niche and, and not just the
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.280]   appliances, but other, other products, more, you know, a little bit more expensive products as well.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.080]   So.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.040]   Cause that, you started with like, if I remember, and I'm going off of memory here,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.280]   your first week or something, I mean, you sold a power tool for 20 bucks, that type of thing,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.600]   where it was five or $10 at a time, right?
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.560]   And that's where you moved to appliances and say, well, you know, 10 power tools at 10 bucks a pop
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.880]   of profit versus one washing machine at a couple hundred bucks of profit. It doesn't take,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.160]   doesn't take a rocket science to say, let me go where the margins are better.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.960]   Yeah. And a lot of that was, you know, just really quick. A lot of that was just
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.040]   part of the learning experience. At first I was terrified of losing any money,
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.240]   especially when I only had a couple hundred bucks. So I didn't want to buy something
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.960]   that wasn't going to, I wouldn't be able to quickly sell. Cause I, I afford to just sit
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.440]   on items for a couple of weeks waiting for them to sell and not make any money. And so I had to,
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.880]   I had to turn things quickly and I also couldn't tie up all my capital in just a couple items or
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.960]   one item for that matter. And yeah, but you know, it's, it's a learning experience, you know,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.600]   it's kind of like, uh, yeah. Learning how to invest, learning how to, um, yeah.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.040]   So how many years ago was that that you, that you first started now?
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:34.640]   Uh, it's been, let's see, it's been four and a half years ago, I think. I'm really bad with dates,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.960]   but it's, yeah. Four and a half years ago. How, how have you developed your business over,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   over time? Yeah. So I, I eventually, I eventually, uh, I think it was, it took about a year,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:55.520]   I think, or a little less than a year, but I eventually saw the potential in appliances and
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:01.920]   I just went all in on appliances. I still buy and sell other things, you know, like I go to garage
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.840]   sales and, and just for like, it's kind of a, it's a hobby of mine just for fun. And I'm always just
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.920]   randomly buying things on Craigslist too. So, um, but yeah, I, and one of the reasons is, is because
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.800]   if you, if you, especially if you find a high profit niche, uh, if you focus on that and become
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.240]   an expert in that niche, you don't have to work as hard, like just because you have to, you don't
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.600]   have to think as much on every single transaction or potential purchase. And, and that's been really
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.440]   nice, you know, um, cause basically once you become an expert, you just, you can, um, you know,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.680]   I can look at a page of a hundred ads and probably 20 seconds, 25 seconds. Wow. Just, I can scan all
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.320]   a hundred of them and tell you which ones are worth buying and which ones aren't and how much
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.960]   money you could make on them. So, um, it takes much less of my time to do what I used to spend
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.320]   all day doing. So just over time, you've, it's become intuitive for you just to understand,
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.560]   okay, that, that, you know, this brand of washing machine has this certain value, as long as it's
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.840]   in this certain condition, or have you specifically studied it, charted it out in some way? Yeah,
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.880]   it's, it's basically, it's recognizing the makes and the models, like which brands they are,
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:23.360]   the age, the type, you know, um, you can, you can tell a lot about the condition of it. The color
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.120]   is important. Um, you know, and it almost seems they, they'll affect, you know, how much,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:36.000]   how much is that? I mean, how can I, how much can I pay for that and still, uh, turn a profit on it,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.600]   you know, so it's worth my time. Uh, and then, you know, and then even once I do find the items
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.200]   that I, or appliances that I want to purchase, I'm very quickly, or I'm, I can quickly scan through
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.800]   the, the actual description of the ad and, of the item and, and decide if it's a good buy or not.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.640]   And so I know all that, you just kind of, you learn what red flags to look for and what,
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:04.240]   uh, what to stay away from. So. Hmm. So it's worked, you've succeeded,
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.480]   are you still getting out of debt or were you able to pay off your debt?
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.440]   Yeah. Yeah. We paid off the debt. Congrats, man. That's so exciting.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:17.040]   Yeah. It was a, that was a really, um, that was one of the, that was a really big accomplishment
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.240]   for us. So, yeah, that's exciting. And you've expanded your operation, right? You have at least
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.560]   one person working for you at this point. Yeah. Well, it's, it's expanded and contracted a little
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   bit. Like, um, I brought on a partner and, and we, we went, we worked at it for quite a while.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.760]   And then it was just more of a difference in philosophy and like how we're, you know,
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   like partnerships that ended up happening. Um, and so we went our separate ways. And so then it
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:50.800]   was back to myself and my brother and, uh, and, and just recently, like even within the last month,
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.280]   I've been encouraging him to start up an operation back in, in our hometown,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.800]   uh, where he's got a couple of girls there. So, um, yeah, it's actually right now it's back to me.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:08.080]   And, um, yeah. So I was excited when I saw you put up a course, cause you're selling a course now
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:15.280]   on how to do this business, right? Yeah. I thought about this as, and I know you have kids and I've
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.960]   got, I've got one son so far, uh, and he's almost a year old. So he's a little early,
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.640]   little early to get out in the pickup truck and start loading up appliances. But I've been
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:32.160]   thinking a lot about how I want to teach my son the skills of business. And one of the things that
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.520]   I've, I've seen recommended in the past by many people is, you know, take your son to, uh, or
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.680]   a daughter to a flea market, teach them how to bargain, how to ha how to haggle things like that.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.520]   But where I live like, Hey, we don't have a lot of flea markets and the ones we do don't have
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.960]   anything that I want. So it has seemed like, ah, that's not something I want to do. But I feel like
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.720]   for maybe like for a high school student or for a home educated student, a business like this on
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   the side is way better than, than getting some, you know, job somewhere, just some entry level job
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:11.920]   because a, you're learning the fundamental skill of business and B it's entirely self-directed
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.840]   and you can do it on your own time. You can do it more when you have more time and you can do it
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   less when you have less time. Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, I guess just a couple of little tidbits about
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.640]   what I'm, what I've been doing with my son. So my son's eight years old. He's almost nine.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:37.440]   Um, he knows how to diagnose most of the, you know, most of the, uh, um, repair is needed on,
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:43.520]   on the top of the washers and dryers. Uh, he can already, I've already taught him how to scan
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.920]   the Craigslist ads cause he, cause he just wants to, like, he's very driven. Um, you know, even at
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.600]   seven, eight years old, he was already able to find the good deals on Craigslist. Basically.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:22:00.640]   It's not a scientist. It's, it's teaching them how to recognize what is a recognize certain
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.680]   brands makes models and how much a good prices, you know, and then that's takes a little bit of
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.440]   work, but you know, if they want to learn it, they can do that. And, um, yeah, you know,
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.720]   we homeschool our kids. And so like when I have a delivery or I'm going to take in a bunch of
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:23.760]   machines to the scrapyard, you know, my boys love going along and, um, I fully expect with,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:30.640]   with a reasonable amount of work, uh, my son should be doing, he should be able to do most
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.320]   of the work by the time he's 10 to maybe 11 years old. And obviously the things like answering the
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.760]   phone for a sales call, that's, I'm not going to have him do that. You know, imagine someone
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.640]   calling about an appliance and a 10 year old answering the phone. Um, but, but everything
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.080]   else, I mean, he can, he already, he can take pictures. He can write up the descriptions,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:56.000]   post the ads and Craigslist. Um, there's really not too much other than moving really heavy
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.280]   appliances that they can't do. They just need a little bit of help on that. So, um, and then
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.800]   just the last thing is, it's an incredible opportunity to spend time with your kids.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.840]   You know, they're, my boys will never forget all the time that I've spent with them. You know,
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.560]   going around doing pickups and stopping for ice cream and just doing fun things, you know,
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:22.560]   when we're driving around. And so, yeah. And I mean, it's a perfect business that it's a perfect
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.520]   business to be able to integrate family. I think about that a lot cause I used to run a financial
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.440]   planning firm and one of the things that I didn't like about that business is I couldn't, it's not
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.000]   the kind of thing where I could easily bring, uh, you know, my children with me, but your type of
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.240]   business is one where you can be fully integrated with your children. And what an amazing way to,
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.040]   uh, what amazing, what an amazing way to teach them social skills. What an amazing way to teach
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:52.480]   them business skills. What an amazing way just to build time with them. Yeah. And go ahead.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:24:01.440]   Oh yeah, no, it's, it's, it's amazing. I've had, um, yeah, both, both in the good and I've seen the
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:09.920]   good, uh, learning about, uh, yeah. Learning, learning how to, uh, um, basically learning how
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.320]   to deal with people. Um, my, my son, my oldest son especially goes with me on a lot of deliveries.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.560]   And so he's helping, he like holds my tool pouch as I'm bringing the washers and dryers inside of
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.160]   houses. And, um, yeah, it's been great because it's basically, it's not sheltering them from
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:30.240]   the world. Like I had a, I had a delivery, uh, about a month ago and this lady refused to pay
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.720]   for the washer. Um, because she was convinced that she was hearing a noise, you know, that
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.000]   there was something wrong with the washing. And, and I had to be firm with her and tell her that
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.920]   she was going to pay for the washer or we were going to have to pack it back up and leave. And
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:49.280]   she was trying to get, leave it with her and she would send a check and all this stuff. And, um,
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.120]   it kind of got a little heady cause I was like, this is not going to happen. Like, you know,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.280]   this is how it's going to be. You're going to pay or we're going to leave with the washer machine.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.760]   And, and he's standing right there next to me the whole time. And it, it got really awkward. And I
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.000]   said, all right, we're, we're going to take the washer. And so we packed it back up and hauled
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.360]   it back out of the basement. And, and basically, you know, the whole time we're driving back home,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.000]   uh, I'm just teaching him. It was like, you know, I was teaching my son Moses, you know, that,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.200]   uh, you know, not every, not every, uh, person is worth doing business with. And sometimes you
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.520]   just need to walk away and not, it's better to not do business with something that's going to,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.720]   uh, that really is going to come back to bite you the next day or a week later. And, uh, it's just
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:36.640]   not worth the stress. And so, yeah, there's been a lot of really good learning and teaching,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:43.200]   teachable moments, um, just observing, uh, you know, how to do, how to do business with the
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.920]   public. Right. I wouldn't be surprised if by 10 or 11, he is, uh, he's capable of taking a sales
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:56.320]   call. Uh, remember Thomas Jefferson was running a plantation at the age of 12. You know, Ben
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.520]   Franklin at the age of 11 was, I think I could be mixed up on my date, but by about the age of 11,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:08.000]   Ben Franklin and his buddies were starting their, um, uh, the, the almanac thing that they had done.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.040]   I mean, we've, it's throughout history, there have been many people that have served, you know,
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.240]   12 or 13 has been a very traditional age for, you know, the transition from childhood to manhood,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:24.800]   in, you know, throughout history in many cultures. Yeah, that's very interesting. I read, I was just
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.720]   trying to find it real quick. I couldn't find it, but I was recently reading a story about a, uh,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.880]   I think it was an Admiral and I can't find the name again, I can't find the story, but
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:41.360]   it was talking about an Admiral. It was a young man who was given charge of, uh, was given charge
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:47.200]   of a ship. I think it was during the Revolutionary War, uh, and he wasn't, he was in, you know, he
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.360]   was in his early teens and he was commanding a ship full of men. I can't confirm that if I can
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.240]   find it, I'll, I'll put it in the, after, after the interview, uh, for the audience, but it's just,
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.680]   it's interesting. I think it's a, it's a theme. It seems like young people are far more capable
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:07.920]   oftentimes than we give them credit. Yeah. You wrote, go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt. Go
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.400]   ahead. Oh, no, no. Yeah. I was just going to say that's, that's kind of my wife and I's philosophy
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:19.360]   as we've been raising our kids is, um, and it's kind of my philosophy in life period is why,
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.920]   why can't this happen? Or why can't I do this? Why can't our kids do this? And, um, you know,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.200]   so we have, you know, especially reading some, um, you know, reading some of the financial books,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.400]   it was really getting me to think out into the future is like, why can't my kids pay cash for
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.040]   their first house by the time they're 18? Right. They absolutely can, you know, and, and why can't
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.160]   my kids run their own business or, or learn how to run their own business before they're 10? And
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:52.560]   the kids pick up on that and, and kids tend to rise to the, to the level of expectations that
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:58.000]   their parents set for them. And unfortunately in our culture, people and parents, many parents set
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.640]   the expectations pretty low. And, um, we've just been finding that, you know, we're not putting
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.480]   pressure on them because I'm not pressuring them into any one way, one business or another, but,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:15.360]   um, I kind of, I do encourage them if they want to, you know, spend time in the different
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.560]   businesses that we've got going. Um, yeah. And it's, it's been amazing.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:26.160]   I've seen enough examples of it to know it's possible. Uh, there's a book, uh, that I haven't
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.840]   read it yet, but it's on my list of people that I'd like to talk to about it. Uh, there's a man
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.600]   named Steven Maxwell. Uh, he and his wife wrote a book called Buying a House Debt-Free, and with
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.200]   their children, uh, their three oldest children, their three oldest sons so far, uh, all of them
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.120]   purchased a home debt-free, uh, by the time they, uh, see, before they were 30. And so like kind of
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.000]   when they were starting their, when they were starting their lives, uh, all three of their
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.720]   oldest sons at least have started off on that foundation. And if you compare that, I mean,
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.800]   I can, I can point to you and your wife, uh, you, you teach your children at home, is that right?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.480]   Yeah. Okay. Right. So, I mean, when you look at that and you start looking around in the,
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.960]   uh, the home education community, I mean, you can find example after example after example of normal
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:19.760]   everyday, I wouldn't say average, but people of not extra special intelligence completing their
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:26.720]   college degrees by 16, 17, 18 years old, and being positioned, uh, with business skill,
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:34.240]   with the academic credentials to get started, uh, at an earlier age. Yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean,
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.600]   it's pretty mind-boggling when you think about how far ahead your, your kids could be, you know,
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.240]   compared to their peers at, you know, by the time that their peers are coming out of high school.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:53.600]   Like, yeah, not only teaching them not to be into debt and to save, but like to, to potentially
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.400]   already own their own home. And I mean, it just, the position it puts them in going forward,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:04.880]   um, it's, it's pretty incredible. So. Yeah. It's amazing. And there are so many people who have
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:11.280]   done it, uh, even just, you know, one of the things I'm a little bit bitter about is the fact
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.560]   that I was always taught by all the financial books I read as a young man that, you know,
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.080]   I need to save 10 or 20% of my income and that I was doing really good by the, if I saved 10 or 20%
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.720]   of my income. And then later I stumbled across the, you know, all of the financial independence,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.680]   early retirement community online. And I found out that people were saving 50% of their income
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.960]   and 70% of their income and 80% of their income. And I think, you know, I could have done that.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.440]   I could have done it without a problem, but I, no one had ever told me I could. And so
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:47.920]   for some reason I didn't, I didn't realize that I could do that. Uh, let's switch gears and I'm
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:55.600]   interested in your talking through a scenario that is probably my favorite blog post that you wrote.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.000]   And the reason is that, that, or at least of your posts that I've read, it's my favorite one that
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.920]   I've sent various people to. Uh, the thing I see about a business like yours is it doesn't depend
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.600]   on anyone else. And what an amazing boost to the con to your confidence. If you always know you
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:21.360]   can fall back on this, uh, on this as a skill, as a skill to learn that you can exert. So you,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.600]   I'm sure you'll probably move on to other businesses in the future, but just the knowledge
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.760]   of the fact that you could sell out your whole inventory and if you could start again with a
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.000]   few hundred bucks or, and you could build your business back up cause you've done it already.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.560]   Yeah. You wrote a blog post, uh, piggybacking on a blog post that Mr. Money Mustache wrote called,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:45.840]   if I were starting over again from zero, how would I do it? What would you do if I took away all your
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.160]   money, took away everything that you've got, took away all your inventory and said, Ryan,
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:57.040]   you got to start over again. What would you do? Yeah. I mean, uh, I haven't even looked at that
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.520]   post a long time, but yeah, I remember a lot of what I wrote and, um, I'm off of, it would be a
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.320]   really fun, it has to be a fun little adventure, um, to be able to like almost be dropped in a
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:15.200]   city with nothing and you have to start over again. Um, but yeah, I, you know, the, the first
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.560]   thing, the first thing I would do is, uh, you have to, as long as you have a place to stay,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:26.000]   I mean, I guess how, how from nothing are we starting from? You can start from wherever you
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.560]   want. If you want, you want me to put you on the street sleeping in a cardboard box, I can do that.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.880]   If you want to be sleeping in your car, that's fine. Or if you want to be crashing with friends,
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.840]   I think it's unrealistic for most people that a friend wouldn't take them in on their couch.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.960]   So let's start from there. Yeah, we'll start from there. And usually that friend would probably have
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.160]   internet, but if they didn't, uh, there's public internet, the libraries and many other places,
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:56.400]   uh, and computers, if you didn't have a computer either or a phone. And, uh, but basically,
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:02.000]   you know, to start off, you just have to figure out how to get just enough resources, um, to get
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.240]   your first item or, um, and, and right off the bat, like going to the public library,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   even without a phone, you can, you can just start looking at the free section. And there's like,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.520]   I never added up the value from one day of Portland. That's where I live. The free section,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.360]   the amount of stuff that's given away in the free section every day, it's, it's in the tens of
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.880]   thousands of dollars. Like, and it doesn't take, but just picking up one or two of those items
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.120]   that are just kind of decent to make, you know, you're not going to get, sometimes you can make
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.000]   a ton of money on the free items, but, um, anyways, just picking up a couple of those and
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   then, and then reselling them. Um, and it is possible to sell items without taking pictures
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.160]   of them. So you can just go back to your public library computer and repost it without a picture
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:53.600]   and with a good description. So, I mean, it really, that, that's where it starts. I mean,
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:00.080]   or you can start with as much, you know, um, you know, one of the things that I talked about in
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.800]   the post was getting a mode of transportation, like a bike. So going on the free section until
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.080]   you get a bike, get the bike and then go from there. Yeah, there's a lot of valuable free items
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.800]   that you can pick up with your bike and, and resell. And then you all, then you just need to
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.200]   save some of that money and, and then reinvest some of it, live off some of it. And, uh, yeah.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.400]   Yeah. The, the, the, the thing about the free section is that just because something's on there
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.680]   doesn't necessarily mean that it's not worth anything. And this is the, to me, this is the
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:42.640]   key with Craigslist or, or garage sales, anything like that. Value is worth what an item is available
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.600]   for. It doesn't necessarily start, you know, that that's not necessarily what it sells for.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:52.080]   There've been lots of times where something is, is valuable to me and I want to get a good price,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.000]   but then there's times when I just want to get rid of something. And I've put lots of good things on
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Craigslist because I want it gone in two hours. And I know if I put it on the free section,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.080]   somebody will be done. It'll be gone in two hours and it saves me the guilt of sending it away,
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   a perfectly good item away for free, excuse me, to the, to the garbage. I'm not, I don't want to
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:16.160]   throw something away if someone else can use it or repurpose it or something like that. So, I mean,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.440]   you can start with that. I mean, on your post, how to start from zero, you said, starting off,
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.040]   you know, get a bike with a trailer. So that way, you know, you got to figure out how to get that
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.080]   and get one for free or fix one up or, or offer somebody to, you know, some extra yard work or
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:35.520]   something like that. Get a mobile computer, AKA a smartphone, get some tools, you know,
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.600]   get some tools for fixing dryers and then go right into the appliance business was, was,
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:45.520]   was what it is. But to me, that's a formula. What I like about that is that's a simple formula that
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:53.600]   can be applied to really any business or any job. And as a metaphor, you need a transportation to
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.760]   get where your work is, work is valuable. If you don't have that, you've got to get that.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.680]   Then you need to build some tools. And so whether that's in your case, you're talking about
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.920]   a pair of pliers and a wrench, or whether that's a basic skill set of some kind, you need a mobile
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.440]   computer, AKA a smartphone, which is a method of marketing that. And then, you know, you just get
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.080]   started. And that's what the fundamental basis of business is. Every single business is exactly the
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:27.440]   same. Yeah. So any tips? Let's close with this unless you have anything else. Last thought I
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.560]   have is any you are probably the you're the most experienced buyer and seller of things that I have
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:40.240]   I have ever talked to any tips for getting a really good deal and any tips for for getting
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   top dollar for your stuff on Craigslist? Let's see, let's go get in a really good deal.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:54.320]   Starting, I'll start with the free section, you have to be really quick. So obviously,
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.600]   everything on the free section is free. And like you'd said, there are some incredibly
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   valuable things that are given away in the free section. You know, a lot of it,
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:09.680]   people are like people will be like, for example, on appliances, they'll use their appliances up
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.920]   until the day they move in there, right? Just because they need to, you know, and then they'll
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.960]   dump them for free, you know, a couple hours before they move. And that happens all the time,
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.840]   as well as lots and lots of other items. So you just have to be really quick, like you have to
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.240]   be sitting there refreshing and wait in this the moment the new post didn't get listed, you have to
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.440]   respond quickly. And if you don't, you're not going to get them. Because in Portland here, there's
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.600]   hundreds and hundreds of people sitting on the free section trying to snag those items. So
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.760]   quick tip, how to get free items, when there's 300 other people trying to get them as well,
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:49.360]   respond to the item you want as quickly as you can. And then in this subject line, instead of
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.680]   just letting it auto fill itself, offer a little bit of money, like, say, I will give you $10 for
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.920]   this dryer. And so there'll be 50 or 100 other people that will respond to that free dryer, but
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.000]   yours is going to stick out. And most of the time, they will end up giving you the item because
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.920]   you're willing to give them a little bit more value than anyone else. You pick it up quickly,
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.720]   and you'll give them $10. That worked for me, I had some tile on, I had, I was cleaning out a
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.640]   shed that I had to take down. And I had a bunch of miscellaneous tile that was left over. And there
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:24.000]   were a few pieces of mismatched ones. But there were several boxes of some pretty good tile. And
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.880]   I tried to sell it, I'd had some good success selling of some other things. And I'd listed it
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.920]   and nobody bid on it. And finally, I want this stuff gone. So I put it on the free section,
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.080]   a guy and I said, first come first serve. Well, then some guy called me and said, I'll come pick
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.720]   it up tomorrow morning. And I run a charity, you know, out of a church, we collect this kind of
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.200]   stuff. And I said, Okay, you can come tomorrow morning. And then some and then somebody else
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.920]   texted me and said, Hey, you know, is it still available? I said, No, sorry. There was somebody
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.400]   else. And they responded back, listen, we really want it, we really need it 20 bucks, and we'll be
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.520]   there in an hour. And I said, Okay, you know, and I called the guy, the pastor guy back. And I said,
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.440]   Hey, listen, I'm sorry, man. I said in the ad, first come first serve, but this guy gave me
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.080]   money. And you know, frankly, that I'll take the money. But he got a really great deal on quite a
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.920]   value of of tile just because he offered a little bit of money. Yeah, yeah, no, that's a great.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:23.120]   Yeah, you know, it's just a great way to position yourself to really get some of those free items.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:29.040]   As far as buying items, it really comes down to research, like no,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.480]   know what you're buying, know what it costs new, know what the average price costs use.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:43.040]   And in really, an item that has a flaw that you can't detect isn't a good deal. Like you need to
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:51.200]   be able to know enough to about the items to detect flaws, cracks, problems with it. So I mean,
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.360]   I get a lot of emails from people that are bought things and they ended up being lemons or they've
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:03.440]   broken. So you need to know enough about the item to be able to to inspect it properly to
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:10.640]   make sure everything works great. And yeah, and as far as
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:17.040]   getting good deals, it helps if something's someone's overpriced something a little bit
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.920]   and you want to get a good deal on it. Just don't hesitate to shoot out an offer. Just email them
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:27.440]   and say, hey, I'm interested in the item. Would you be willing to take such and such amount?
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.400]   No worries either way. Have a great day. Be pleasant about it. Some people need the money.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.080]   They need the higher price and let them have that. If they don't want to go down,
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:43.360]   it's not worth being ruthless over it. But yeah, eventually, just be patient. Because eventually,
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.520]   if something's not listed one day, usually that's when people get tempted. Oh, I got to go out and
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:55.040]   buy it new. But just patient. Check later in the day. Check the next day. Patience is the number
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:02.800]   one reason or the number one contributor of you saving money when you buy things. And if you're
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.760]   just willing to wait for it, you're going to be able to eventually find it cheaper.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:15.040]   The next iPhone whatever is going to come out and there's going to be a huge number of people going
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.440]   for it, paying hundreds of dollars. And at about a year and a half, they'll give it to you for 99
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.560]   bucks brand new. Or you can buy a bunch of them on Craigslist for not much money, right?
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.360]   Stay away from the bleeding edge of especially technology. Right.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.000]   Be willing to live just a little bit behind everyone else, which is totally fine.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.480]   Right. And then one more tip on the selling side. And this is huge. A lot of times,
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.760]   most people aren't experts at, you know, in the market for their items market. They don't know
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:53.040]   what the average used price sells for. They don't know what the supply and demand is. And one of the
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.920]   things I encourage people, if you really don't know how much something's worth, price it on the
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:06.480]   higher side. Just by default. And I also encourage people not to put their phone number on it. If
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.240]   you really don't know how much your item's worth, just put the ad up. Let people email you if
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:15.200]   they're interested. If you put an item up and you get like 10 emails in the first hour,
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:22.400]   probably greatly underpriced the item and just take it down or change the ad. Right. And raise
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.160]   the price. And that's why I encourage people not to put their phone number on it, just because
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.600]   otherwise you're going to get 10 calls. Everyone's going to keep calling you and tell you answer.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.040]   So but if you just leave that out, you just you can it enables you to change the price. And
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.720]   then the other thing is, is once you settle on a price like, nope, this is what we think the item's
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:46.880]   worth. Be patient. Like don't, you know, cars are the worst. You can put a car up, you'll get 10
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:52.960]   dealers calling you in the first 20 minutes, offering you half of what you just listed your
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.600]   car for. What I encourage, I encourage people to wait, like set a designated amount of time,
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.280]   especially on bigger ticket items like cars or motorcycles or things like that. Wait like a week.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.680]   Let the item sit up there at your listed price for a week before you drop the price. And when
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.960]   people ask if you'll take half or, you know, knock it down by 25 percent, say I'm going to
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.040]   stick with our listed price for the first week. And that tip alone can save hundreds and even
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.640]   thousands of dollars for someone willing to follow that advice. So do you go back through ads when
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.800]   you're looking to buy things from old dates and try to make offers since you know that maybe you
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:38.480]   can get better deals? Is that worth the time? I don't do it as much anymore. I used to do a lot,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.640]   especially, it all depends on where you're at. I mean, if you really, and it kind of comes down
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:49.600]   to the hustle. If you really need inventory, like say it's really slow. Yeah, absolutely. Go look
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.160]   through all the old ads, the ones that have been up there for a number of days and say, hey, if you
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:02.640]   still have this, would you be willing to take such and such amount? And a side tip, when you're
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:09.360]   making low ball or when you're making real offers on stuff, when someone's overpriced their item,
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:16.160]   be really courteous because it's a real sensitive thing with people. And if you're really courteous
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.680]   and kind in your emails and you say, hey, no worries either way, it really communicates to
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:29.120]   the person. It kind of puts them in a good mood basically. If you're real harsh about it, like
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:34.560]   I'll give you half price with a grant, they're never going to respond to you or they're going
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.960]   to respond, they're going to be absolutely not. Be friendly and you're more likely to get a
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.560]   friendly response from people. You've settled on appliances, but do you think there are other
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   niches that could also be good? I mean, you mentioned cars, that may be good, maybe not,
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.600]   but whether it's things like lawn equipment or I don't even know, but there are probably other
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:02.960]   niches, right? There's a ton of other niches. And one of the things that's difficult, it's hard for
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.360]   me to write about each one of them extensively just because I'm not pouring that much time into
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:15.680]   each one. I mean, I know a lot of people that are doing bicycles, at least part-time, some of them
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:24.560]   full-time, just bicycles. And pretty much anything that can be expensive, new, you could usually make
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:31.920]   a living off of buying and selling it used. So bicycles, furniture, lawn equipment, small engine
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:40.800]   repair, any of the niches where you can actually repair the items, that can be a good one. Electronic
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:47.120]   repair, computers, and some of the smaller electronics, you really have to be good at it
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   because it's a ruthless market. But it's just, yeah, there's a lot of different items. I don't
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:09.520]   have an exhaustive list, but if it's somewhat expensive new, then there's probably... Yeah,
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.760]   the more expensive it is new, the more room there is for a used market.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:22.880]   - Right. And that's the fundamental of really, again, like every item. You're not gonna go and
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:30.160]   buy a recycled Dixie cup necessarily. But if an item has some value, whether that's what a jeweler
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:36.320]   does, they buy cheap, they sell deer. That's what a pawn shop does, they buy cheap, they sell deer.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:44.560]   That's the fundamental nature of business. And the key, as I see, is simply that the service
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:51.040]   that you're providing is inventory and convenience. So as I look at car dealers, I think to myself,
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.200]   "How does the car dealer make money?" Well, the way they make money is that they have an inventory
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.400]   there. So when somebody is ready to go shopping, they've trot right down to the lot, and there are
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:05.680]   48 cars there that you can choose from and you can buy it. Now, the person could get it on Craigslist,
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:10.560]   but the problem...themselves, and save probably whatever the dealer markup is, anywhere from a
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.680]   few hundred bucks to many thousands of dollars. But the problem is that there's an asynchronous
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.160]   need and transaction. So unless they were thinking ahead, which is what most people don't do,
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.280]   and recognizing, "My car is...I need to be starting to shop for another car and spending the next six
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   months finding a deal." Well, then the car goes out on a Thursday afternoon, they have to skip
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.560]   work on Friday, and they need a car over the weekend. So you overpay by 3,000 bucks versus
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.000]   what you could do if you had the time to shop for it. And the same thing with appliances. I mean,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.560]   you're providing a good deal for the people buying it, but you're providing the convenience
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.360]   of having it now, not having to sit around and look at the ads and then figure out how to fix
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.440]   the thing. You're giving people a good deal, cheaper than trotting down to Sears and getting
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.800]   a new one, and you're providing a service for the ones that you're taking away and keeping them out
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:05.520]   of the trash, which is great. Yeah. And that's where there's a lot of money. If you can repair
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:11.920]   the items that you get back for free, that's where a lot of money is made.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.480]   That's great. Tell us about your appliance school. I haven't been through it. I have just seen it,
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.680]   and I've sent a couple people to go look at it because it seems like a really cool
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.160]   info product offering that you have with your appliance school, if anyone's interested. Tell
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:30.080]   us what's in it and how that works. Yeah. It came out of consulting. I was
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.600]   consulting for people all over the country through the blog that found out about me doing the
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:40.160]   appliance thing and eventually realized that I needed to automate it to some degree and also
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:47.520]   make the teaching more thorough. There's only so much you can cover in consultations that are
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:54.080]   one hour at a time. So yeah, basically, we put everything that a person would need to know,
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:49:00.240]   starting from scratch with no mechanical ability or understanding about appliances at all for the
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:06.400]   business, and just walk them through what to expect, what tools they need to get started,
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:12.480]   which machines to buy and sell, how much to pay, how to inspect them before they buy,
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.320]   how to repair, how to clean, how to paint, how to list them for sale, how to deal with the sales
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:27.040]   calls. And then we added training videos, and we have a forum with everyone else in the community
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.760]   all over the country and Canada that's a part of the appliance school community.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:41.920]   Yeah, it's an awesome little community. The response has been very encouraging and very
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:47.120]   good. There's many, many people all over the country that have gone through the course and
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.080]   that are doing it full-time and earning a living. And there's a lot more people that are doing it
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:59.760]   part-time, just getting it going. My son, we're 12 years, 13, 14 years old, he would be taking it
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:05.680]   right now. And I'd say $147 for education, that can start a business that can probably be done
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:11.440]   anywhere. It'd probably save... I mean, you succeeded in making $100 a day most days when
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.400]   you were getting started. But I guarantee after a couple of years, you had learned some of the
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   tricks that you share in that course. And to me, that's called education that pays off.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:28.960]   Yeah. Yeah. So when you sell an appliance, the average profit is somewhere between $120 and $140.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.560]   One deal.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:36.800]   Yeah. The course gets paid off pretty quickly after you sell the first couple of appliances.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.320]   That's great. Minivan and a small trailer and a web connection and you're in business.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.920]   Ryan, thank you for coming on. re-craigslist.com, links in the show notes. Anywhere else,
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.840]   anything else you want to plug while we're on?
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.280]   Yeah, I was just in the appliance courses over at applianceschool.com.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:58.400]   Cool. Perfect. Applianceschool.com. Awesome. Thank you so much for coming on. I appreciate it.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.960]   Yeah, it was great talking to you, Joshua. Thanks for having me.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:08.320]   Told you it'd be fun. Of course, I've told you all the interviews I've ever done on this show.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:13.120]   I've told you they would be fun. But Ryan, thank you for coming on. I enjoyed it. I learned a lot.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.120]   I want to share with you a couple of things here as we wrap up today's episode.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:22.800]   After the interview, I couldn't remember who the person was that I referenced as far as
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:30.080]   the admiral that I had said was an admiral at a young age. And I couldn't remember all
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:36.000]   the details from it. So after the interview, I went back and researched it. And there'll be a
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.080]   link to the Wikipedia article in the show notes if you would like to read. But the person that I
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:49.440]   was thinking of was a man named David Farragut. F-A-R-R-A-G-U-T. David Farragut. And David was
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:52:00.080]   born in 1801. And at the age of nine, he enlisted in the Navy, in the American Navy, when he was nine
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:07.840]   years old. And then he continued to serve in the Navy for the next 60 years until his death at the
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:14.480]   age of 69. And I'll read two quick paragraphs here from the Wikipedia article. So remember,
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:21.120]   he was born in 1801. So listen to this right here. "Through the influence of his adopted father,
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.920]   Farragut was commissioned as a midshipman in the United States Navy on December 17, 1810,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:35.280]   at the age of nine. A prize master by the age of 12, Farragut fought in the War of 1812,
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:41.920]   serving under Captain David Porter. While serving aboard the USS Essex, Farragut participated in
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:50.240]   the capture of HMS Alert on August 13, 1812, then helped to establish America's first naval base and
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:57.760]   colony in the Pacific, named Madisonville, during the ill-fated Nuku Hiva campaign. At the same
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   time, the Americans battled the hostile tribes on the islands with the help of their T'le allies.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:10.640]   Farragut was 12 years old when, during the War of 1812, he was given the assignment to bring a ship
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:17.520]   captured by the Essex safely to port. He was wounded and captured while serving on the Essex
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:24.080]   during the engagement at Valparaiso Bay, Chile, against the British on March 28, 1814." So he'd
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:30.960]   be 13 years old at that time. "Farragut was promoted to lieutenant in 1822 during the
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:38.640]   operations against West Indian pirates." So that would be at the age of 21. "In 1824," age of 23,
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:44.160]   "he was placed in command of the USS Ferret, which was his first command of a U.S. naval vessel."
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:50.480]   And then it goes on with more details. Isn't that amazing? So clearly he wasn't given the
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:55.920]   full command of a U.S. Navy vessel, which is what I was remembering, until the age of 23.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:02.160]   But at 12 years old, he was assigned to be the captain, a prize master. So a prize would be when
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.520]   they defeated another ship, and the prize master would be the captain that they put on board that
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:11.760]   ship to bring it into port. A prize master given the assignment to captain a ship and bring it into
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:19.600]   port at the age of 12. Amazing, huh? We'll talk more about that stuff later. A couple of quick
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.640]   things that I learned from the interview with Ryan. And then one mentioned about his course,
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:33.040]   because after the call, we were talking about his course as far as his appliance school course. And
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.680]   he offered me an affiliate link, and I'll give you that information real quick in just a moment.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.880]   That was cool. It was unexpected, but I'll mention that to you in case you're interested
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.400]   in checking out his appliance school. So first of all, a couple of things. Number one,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:50.800]   notice some of the themes. Ryan had a system of accountability with his friends that he had to
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.960]   email, and he had to be accountable for his actions. I've noticed this theme among a lot
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.840]   of entrepreneurs. And so consider, is there a way that you can put some accountability into your
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.400]   life? Because without that system of accountability, I'm not sure that he would have been
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:11.520]   as effective at building his business. Maybe so, but I think that probably helped a lot.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:16.960]   He was also in that do or die situation, that place of desperation, having to make something
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:26.160]   happen. And that's a serious place that can really result in major changes. He learned a lot
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.160]   through the process. He started off not exactly knowing what he was doing, but then he continued
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.680]   to do an 80/20 analysis and focus on where his highest profit was coming from. And then he was
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:40.320]   able to cut out some of the lower profit activities and focus on the higher profit activities.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.440]   That's what's nice about entrepreneurship. One thing that's nice about entrepreneurship
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.360]   is you can get rid of the activities that are not very productive. You don't just have to keep
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.800]   doing them. And then notice that his business has led to new businesses that he probably didn't ever
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:59.440]   anticipate. I don't know how successful his appliance school sales have been for him.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:06.160]   I really don't. But I bet you they're making him some money. If I had the bandwidth,
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.680]   if I were going to be interested in this kind of business, I would take it. I would buy the school
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.680]   just because I would imagine it would save you at least six months or a year worth of experience
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.760]   from learning how to do it. Well, that's a new income source. He's got a school that he set up
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.560]   called Shirt School, how to learn the t-shirt business, and then a scrap metal school. I don't
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:27.200]   know how much money he's making on that stuff. I didn't ask, and it's none of my business. But
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.840]   he probably didn't anticipate those things when he was sitting there at the coffee shop with his
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   friends. So get started and see what happens as time goes on. See where things take you.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:44.560]   And the last thing is I was just struck by how strong his position is as far as having a fallback
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:51.920]   position. Once you've made a living with Craigslist and a smartphone, do you have any fear of failing?
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.520]   I'm sure you still have the fear, but at least you know, "Hey, I can still go back and do that."
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.400]   So wherever his business opportunities and business pursuits take him in the future,
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:06.560]   I am sure that that will set him up. And especially for his kids as well, what an awesome learning
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:10.560]   experience. Check out the article that I will link in the show notes that he wrote about some
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:15.200]   other high school kids that got in touch with him a couple years ago, just two kids, and they were
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.480]   working after school and during the summer on their own business. And they started up their
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.200]   own business doing this and earned far more than whatever they would have made in a retail job.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.320]   So hopefully you check that out. If you're interested in the Appliance School,
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:32.240]   like I said, after we closed up the interview, Ryan told me that he offers affiliate links.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.360]   So if you're interested in the Appliance School, he went ahead and set one up for me.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:41.680]   Wrong button. There we go. He set one up for me and it's linked in the show notes. It's at
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:51.440]   applianceschool.com/?a=rfp. Looks like he put that in wrong. Oh, well. Just follow the link
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:56.400]   in the show notes. That'll take you directly to where it needs to be. And I'll get a credit. I
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.480]   don't know. I don't remember what he said as far as how much it was, but I'll get some sort of
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.280]   referral commission for that if you're interested in checking out his Appliance School.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:09.360]   Haven't been through it myself. I have checked out his sales page. I haven't been through it myself,
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:14.640]   but I definitely think I would. I'm pretty sold on that. If I were starting an appliance business,
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.320]   I would. So maybe this would be an opportunity for some of you who are looking for some
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.840]   part-time income or looking for some full-time income even. Who knows? And if you do go through
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:29.360]   it, I would love to hear from you. I would love to hear from you. And then also the other thing,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:34.080]   if any of you know, if any of you are involved in home education and teaching your children and
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.840]   implementing and integrating your children into your business, I would love to hear from you.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:42.240]   I'd love to interview you on the show. That's a special interest of mine is how to integrate
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:48.000]   your children into your business from an early age to give them useful skills that they can
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.520]   generate money beyond just simply going and taking a retail job at the age of 16. Nothing wrong with
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.680]   that. It's a good place to start, but maybe there might be a way that we could set our kids up for
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:04.160]   higher earning potential, a little bit more financial success and business skills on the
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:09.040]   way through. So if any of you are involved with that, or if any of you are familiar with people
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.080]   who have done a really great job, maybe you read their blog or you've read their books,
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:15.520]   I would love to get that information. I'd love to have them on the show.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:32.000]   That's it for today's show. I hope that you all have a lovely Thursday.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:51.840]   [Music]
