[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   >> Hey, everybody.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Like I said, my name is Jonathan, and I'm going to be
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   telling you a little bit about protein structure prediction.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Oh, wait.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Maybe I was using the wrong first slide there.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   But, you know, if only there was a way that we could easily
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   translate languages, you know, maybe something like Google
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Translate.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Oh, that's great.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   So if you don't speak Chinese, I don't, you can just use
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Google Translate, and you can figure out that I'm actually
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   going to be talking to you today about how to predict protein
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   structure using language translation techniques.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   So I'm really excited about this, and there's been a lot of
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   development in language translation techniques, and I'll
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   try to talk about how that is related.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   But first, let's go over some biology.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So I should really say that my project is actually about how
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   to predict protein structure, and I'm going to be using a
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   little bit of a different language, and I'm going to be
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   using a little bit of a different language, and I'm going
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   to be using a little bit of a different language, and I'm
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   going to be using a little bit of a different language, and
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I'm going to be using a little bit of a different language,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and I'm going to be using a little bit of a different
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   language, and I'm going to be using a little bit of a different
