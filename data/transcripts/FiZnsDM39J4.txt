[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.000]   All right, let's put in one more question here.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.760]   Well, final question here comes from Liata.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.160]   Liata said, is there a place where I can find all of your insights from the podcast written down?
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.000]   She says, I often listen to your podcast when walking to work, but can't keep stopping,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.840]   pulling out a notebook and writing your ideas down.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.200]   I know that many of your ideas appear in your books, blog, and New Yorker articles,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.640]   but do they cover all of your ideas?
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.760]   If you espouse a new idea in the podcast, you always write it down somewhere for future
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.440]   prosperity. I'm thinking I might have to stop listening to your podcast when walking and
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.680]   instead treat it like listening to a lecture, i.e. sitting down at a desk and writing down notes.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.000]   Well, no, there's not right now a place where every idea from the podcast is written down,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.480]   but there's a few things I will suggest here.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.800]   One, the big part of the YouTube page we launched,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.560]   and I keep trying to make this point, is not about trying to build up a large YouTube audience.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.400]   It's not about trying to be a YouTube influencer that is getting people to smash the subscribe
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.440]   button while doing giveaways on Minecraft videos. It's not the goal. The goal is to
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.120]   make the information from the podcast much more usable.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.240]   So now the big ideas I talk about are going to have a core idea video. You can go to the core
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.320]   idea playlist on YouTube and see in one place me talking about each of the big ideas on which I
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.360]   base a lot of my answers. So if you hear a particular answer, like where's that coming
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.800]   from? There's probably going to be a core idea video where the foundational ideas are.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.880]   There's deep dives on there. Usually when I'm working out an idea,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.120]   I might try it a few times and answers. And at some point I'll do a deep dive on that idea.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.280]   There's a playlist of just those deep dives. You can go and see those. If there's a particular
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.800]   question, you say, man, I'm walking and I hear this question and that seems like a big idea.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.120]   Well, there's going to be a video of just that question. You can, within a couple of days of that
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.400]   episode airing that you can find in bookmark. And you could just go and look at, you know,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   go and look at the show notes. Like, oh, what was that? What was that question called? And you'll
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.320]   find it. It'll be posted pretty soon after it comes out. So I'm hoping the YouTube page will
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   make it easy for people to begin pulling out. Like this will be the good archive of the information.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.200]   Now, when the portal launches and the standalone portal launches from which you can access all of
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.320]   the videos and podcast episodes without even having to go to YouTube, it is going to include
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.680]   a dedicated page for every episode of the podcast. You're going to see the show notes,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.000]   the description of every question in that episode on that page. You are going to be able to play it
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.160]   straight from that place. You're going to see every video taken from that episode accessible
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.760]   in a horizontal carousel right there from that page. Once we're doing that, we might start adding
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.920]   more information to our show notes. So that will become a pretty good record as well. But we really
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.560]   are hoping that people can remix and gather their favorite questions, their favorite videos, etc.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.040]   Now that they're all accessible, people can find them, they can put them into their own pages,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.560]   they can put them into their own playlist. So we're really thinking this through. But the YouTube
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.280]   page was a major step towards making the information this podcast way more accessible and
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.160]   findable and saveable than it just being in the long form on audio. So Liata start there,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.120]   get used to the YouTube page, bookmark or save videos that are important to you create your own
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.880]   playlist, that's probably the right way to begin collecting the things we talked about on the
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:37.600]   podcast that are of particular interest to you. [Music]
