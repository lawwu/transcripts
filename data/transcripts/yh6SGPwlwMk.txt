[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520]   "Psalm 19," for the choir director, a psalm of David.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.320]   The heavens are telling of the glory of God, and the expanse is declaring the work of his
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.680]   hands.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.000]   Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.840]   There is no speech, nor are there words.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.080]   Their voice is not heard.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.840]   Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their utterances to the end of the world.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.880]   In them he has placed a tent for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.160]   chamber.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.960]   It rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.680]   Its rising is from one end of the heavens, and its circuit to the other end of them.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.600]   And there is nothing hidden from its heat.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.360]   The law of Yahweh is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Yahweh is sure, making
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.760]   wise the simple; the precepts of Yahweh are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.840]   of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever;
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.520]   the judgments of Yahweh are true; they are righteous altogether.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.880]   They are more desirable than gold, even more than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.200]   and the drippings of the honeycomb.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.280]   Moreover, by them your slave is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.400]   Who can discern his errors?
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.480]   Equip me of hidden faults.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   Also keep back your slave from presumptuous sins.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120]   Let them not rule over me.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.340]   Then I will be blameless, and I shall be acquitted of great transgression.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.160]   Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.800]   O Yahweh, my Rock and my Redeemer.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.300]   Amen.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
