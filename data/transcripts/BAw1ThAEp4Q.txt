[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.720]   - What's up, everybody?
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.120]   I know it's been a minute, but I'm back on Keri's mic.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.920]   We gonna start it off just with a solo episode
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.560]   with my sister, Sierra, answering y'all's questions.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.360]   So that's what we gonna do.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.120]   - All right, there's a lot of good questions.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.160]   We're just gonna start off with basketball topic.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.720]   The first one, a lot of people wanted to know
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.800]   about the finals.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200]   Like, what was your mentality like
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.440]   playing in the NBA finals?
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.180]   Were you scared, excited, nervous?
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.600]   Like, just how does that feel?
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.940]   - Yeah, I think the playoffs is definitely
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.080]   like another level of intensity.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.460]   So you feel it every round.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.740]   So the first round, Minnesota, you know,
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.300]   we actually got a pretty long break
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.200]   between the regular season and the post season
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.680]   because we were the number one seed
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.000]   and then they had to do the playing game.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.640]   So we had some time off.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.480]   So the first game back in that series was super intense.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.560]   Minnesota was a really good team,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.920]   but you feel the increase in intensity every round.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.740]   Yeah, that Suns series was tough.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.200]   They got two back in Phoenix
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900]   and then we were kind of like,
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.960]   we were kind of like not knowing
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.560]   how that was gonna go back in Denver,
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.480]   but we ended up getting those next two games.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.380]   So that was good.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.880]   But then, yeah, once it got to the finals,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.320]   that definitely is a whole nother level of pressure.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.480]   Just, you know, you're so close
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.200]   to knocking on the door of a championship
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.120]   and we felt that.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.040]   But at the same time, it's basketball.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's what you do your whole life.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600]   Like, once you're inside those four lines,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   it's nothing but basketball.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.360]   You just kind of feel the rise in intensity,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.540]   the weight of every shot.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.800]   And that definitely escalates in the finals.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.720]   - People want to know what a game day looks like for you
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.800]   and what's your routine?
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.080]   Like, did it change in the finals
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.360]   or do you just keep it consistent?
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   - A game day for me.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.120]   So, yeah, in the NBA, you wake up
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.440]   probably around like nine-ish.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   You go to the gym, you got shoot around.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.800]   That probably lasts about an hour.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.520]   Then guys get some recovery, some treatment in.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.640]   You go back home, you got the whole afternoon
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.480]   to kind of rest.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.920]   Some guys take a three-hour nap, four-hour nap.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.200]   My naps usually run like two hours.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.300]   Then we go back to the gym.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.960]   If the game is 7.30, I probably get to the gym at like 5.30.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.200]   Have my shooting time, get some treatment,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.480]   get some food in me, and get ready to go.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.320]   So, yeah, it's crazy.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440]   It's really a full-time job.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.320]   On a game day, we're in the gym for about eight hours
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.600]   'cause after the game, I get my lift in,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.080]   get my recovery in.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.400]   So, that's a long day of being in the gym.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.920]   - So, you lift after every game?
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   - Yeah, I lift because we usually play every other day.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.640]   I like to do my lower body lifts after we play
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.360]   so that I get the next day off of lower body
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.080]   and then I'll feel fresh going into the next game day.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.480]   And then I'll do upper body in those gap days.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.320]   - Is that common?
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.240]   Are you the only one that does that?
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.400]   - No, a lot of guys like to lift after games,
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.720]   but it just ends up being a lot.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.400]   You might be tired from the game.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.120]   You might have just lost the game.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   But the routine, the guys who can stick to a routine
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.840]   through the highs and the lows, even if you lose a game,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.160]   I think that's how you can make steady progress.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.180]   There's times after a game you played terrible,
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.840]   you don't want to do anything but just go home and chill.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.120]   But if you can get yourself to go get your lift in,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.960]   stay on that routine, you'll have a lot more good days
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.800]   than bad days, I think.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840]   - I don't know, I can't imagine,
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.080]   like only even playing in college,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.520]   I can't imagine lifting after a game.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.360]   But good job.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.740]   - The shoot around, yeah, the games,
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.280]   the shoot around's probably a little bit longer
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.440]   in the NBA than college.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.200]   Then you play, then you gotta lift.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.260]   Yeah, like I just said, it's hardest
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.120]   when you have a really bad game
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.640]   and then you have to get yourself to go stick to your routine
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.760]   and go lift after.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.600]   That's tough.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.760]   - That is tough.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.080]   - You just wanna go home and sleep.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.160]   So people wanted you to expand on that article
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.280]   that kinda came out towards the end of the series
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.360]   about your back and your injuries.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.480]   They just wanted to hear your own words,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.280]   kind of a little bit of expansion on that.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.040]   - On that article, yeah, I mean,
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.640]   that's one of the main articles
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.600]   that have come out kind of on my story
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.680]   leading up into the NBA.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.840]   And then my journey through the NBA
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.520]   through all these injuries.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.440]   But yeah, I mean, long story short,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.700]   for people that really haven't heard my story,
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.720]   yeah, been playing basketball my whole life,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   really came really easy to me.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.800]   I remember I first got ranked,
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.920]   I think I was ranked like 25th in the country,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.440]   in like eighth grade.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.800]   But ever since then I was rising, rising, rising
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   'til eventually I was the number one player in the country,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.080]   my junior year and senior year.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.000]   And so a lot of expectations come with that,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.520]   like you're expected to be the number one draft pick,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.360]   all these things.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.480]   I remember when I committed to Mizzou,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.240]   like season tickets sold out the same day that I committed,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.280]   like everyone was super, super excited.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.160]   And then I got hurt.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.040]   I'd kind of been dealing with a few back things
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.160]   throughout high school.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.000]   They first kind of started
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   when I tried to dunk on somebody in a practice
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.040]   with a Mocam, my AU team,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   and I fell from real high up on my back.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.380]   And then like it just wasn't feeling right,
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.840]   but I didn't give it a lot of time to rest, to recover.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.240]   So it just kind of kept getting worse
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.880]   over the next year or two until I went to Mizzou
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.600]   and something happened.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.160]   I think I saw a chiropractor or something
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.680]   and they messed it up worse.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.040]   And so I ended up having to get the surgery.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.120]   So that came with its own set of challenges,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.720]   always thinking you were gonna go to college and dominate
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.680]   and then be number one draft pick, all these things.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.440]   That's what really came easy to me.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.600]   - Well, especially like you just said,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.360]   you sold out the whole arena, that's insane.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.400]   And then all those people,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.600]   it's like they bought tickets to see you.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.280]   - Yeah, they bought tickets to see me.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.040]   And I brought some of my friends
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.760]   in the recruiting class with me.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.440]   And all summer I'm balling,
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.960]   I'm dealing with some back pain, but I'm balling.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.720]   I'm ready to go for the season.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.840]   And that first game,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.160]   I remember I'm going through layup lines
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.960]   and I just couldn't, I didn't feel right at all.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.800]   Couldn't jump.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.720]   And that was my first time dealing with the back stuff.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.380]   So I didn't really know how bad it was.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.160]   I was just trying to play through a lot of pain.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.600]   But I remember going up to dad
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.120]   and I just told my dad, like, "I can't play.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.600]   I can't jump off my leg."
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.800]   And then he was like,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.600]   "Well, it's a nationally televised game.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.640]   We need you to start,
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.520]   but you can come out after the first play."
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.600]   So I remember, yeah, one play went by.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.240]   I actually got a bucket,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.120]   a lucky, like a little put back little bucket.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.960]   And then I came out
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.160]   and then my season was pretty much over.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.360]   That was the first.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.000]   So I ended up getting the first surgery after that,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.280]   trying to recover.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.240]   Probably sped up that recovery
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.160]   to try to come back for the NCAA tournament.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.320]   Ended up trying to play in that,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.920]   but probably messed it up again.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.000]   So then I'm trying to,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think I messed it up again,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.240]   'cause I, again, I didn't let my body recover.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.320]   And then I got drafted way later than I thought.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.800]   That whole draft night was very tough for me
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.160]   just because I'm seeing all these guys
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.200]   get drafted before me
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.160]   that I'm thinking that I'm better than.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.640]   Which actually, I feel like our draft class
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.400]   is gonna end up being one of the best.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.800]   Like so many of those guys that got drafted
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.540]   are ending up having really, really good careers.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.080]   But yeah, so that happened.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.360]   So the draft night was not what I dreamed of
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.820]   and all this stuff.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.960]   But in that article, I was just talking about
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.120]   through all these things I've been through.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.720]   Yeah, like you look back on time sometimes
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.800]   and you can see the blessings that come out of it.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.640]   Like I got drafted to Denver
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.880]   and it was the last place I thought I was gonna go.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.360]   But I think I'm the first one out of my draft class
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   that's won a championship, you know what I mean?
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.280]   And that wouldn't have happened
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.480]   if maybe I went to another team.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.600]   You know, there's so many blessings
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.920]   that came out of the situation that God put me in.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.040]   But that was what the article was about.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.540]   Yeah, my journey has not been easy,
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.920]   but it's cool to be able to inspire people
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.000]   that maybe you wouldn't have had a chance to inspire
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.560]   if everything just went smooth.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.400]   - For sure.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.820]   What was one of your biggest learning moments
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.320]   when you came into the league?
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.240]   - One of my biggest learning moments.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.520]   I think that series that Phoenix swept us,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.440]   Jamal had gotten hurt, I think earlier that year,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.920]   so we didn't have Jamal in that series.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.160]   But they ended up sweeping us and that was like,
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.680]   that was an embarrassing playoff series.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.080]   Like we knew we had to be in the gym that summer,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.400]   we knew we didn't want to feel that again.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.760]   I think we had beat the Trailblazers
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.300]   and then we had lost to the Suns and we had got swept.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.460]   And that was not a good feeling,
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.720]   being swept in the playoff series.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.800]   'Cause I've always been a winner.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   Like ever since I was young,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.160]   I feel like I've won at every level, you know, AAU National.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.040]   Like every championship really feels the same.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.000]   Of course the NBA championship is like amazing,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.520]   but it's the same feeling you get
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.160]   when you win a high school championship.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.120]   It's just the more people are watching,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.000]   but anytime you win, it feels great.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.800]   So I've always won championships since I was like young.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.080]   So to get swept in the playoffs
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.320]   was like the most embarrassing thing to me.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.360]   And so to be able to get Phoenix this past year
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.600]   in a great series, you know, they're a really good team,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.160]   felt really good.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.700]   - Okay, so how do you block out the negative comments
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.200]   that come with just being kind of in the limelight?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.580]   - Yeah, man, one thing about our day and age
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.560]   is people, it seems like people get off on hating.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.620]   Like it don't matter how good you're doing in life.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.800]   Like there's so many haters.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.920]   All these people want to have burners accounts
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.160]   and things like that and just talk negatively.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.920]   I mean, it's really hard to block out.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.040]   Everyone sees it.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.120]   If you're a player, I mean, you can distance yourself.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.360]   You can get off of social media.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   You can get off of Twitter and things,
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.120]   but you still, you know, people in the street
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.400]   or people whenever, like.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.720]   So, I mean, it's hard to block out.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.200]   I think you kind of got to get mentally strong enough
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.080]   to just realize that's part of it.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.160]   And a lot of guys in the NBA struggle
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.600]   with some of the mental stuff
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.440]   just because they've been a man their whole life.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.960]   So they always were praised and things like that.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.240]   And then when you get to a point
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.880]   where you're playing 82 games,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.160]   you have good games, bad games.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.080]   So many people saying different comments about you.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.200]   Now money's involved.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.240]   So people are talking about your contract
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.640]   or this or that.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.520]   It can be a lot, but I just think at the end of the day,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.320]   we get paid a lot to play a sport.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.800]   Like our job is not that difficult.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.840]   The worst thing about your job is people on the outside
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.920]   just running their mouth and saying things about you.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.840]   And that makes you want to like quit or go in a shell.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.080]   Like you just got to, you got to check yourself
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.760]   because no one's opinion should have that big
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.600]   of an effect on you.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.240]   And I think for me, I just realized at a young age,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.680]   like I'm looking at all these superstars
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.480]   and there's still people talking negatively about them.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.160]   Like growing up watching Kobe,
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.640]   people still talk crazy about him.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.680]   You know, Russell Westbrook,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.760]   one of the best players of all time.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.640]   Like people talk crazy about him at times in his career.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.640]   Like LeBron, it doesn't matter who you are.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.440]   Giannis, if he misses a couple of free throws,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.280]   people are bashing him.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.840]   So it's like the higher up you get
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.400]   and the better you get,
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.640]   there's going to be more people saying things about you.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.080]   But if there's so many people saying things about you,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.360]   then that means you're doing something right.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.800]   I know that's like, that's cliche, but that's true.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.640]   - It is true.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   'Cause I do feel like what you're saying,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   like the higher the level you get to,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.520]   the louder the noise is.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.880]   Like if you're like, no offense,
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.920]   but someone like on the bench,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.640]   like there's not like much to say,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.600]   but like the more you're doing
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.320]   and the more like people are looking at you,
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.440]   the more people are going to have opinions.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   But yeah, it's just like the juxtaposition of like,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.960]   that just means you're doing better.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.040]   - Yeah, a hundred percent.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.520]   I think I was watching Paul George's podcast with Mikkel
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.120]   and Mikkel said something that stuck out to me.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   He was just like, you got to be confident enough to fail.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.920]   Like you can't be scared of failure.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.040]   You got to go for it, like go for your goals,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.880]   go for your dreams.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.720]   It might be in the middle of a game.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.400]   You might try something,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.920]   try something out that you've been working on all summer.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.960]   You might miss a shot.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   Coach might take you out,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.720]   but you got to be confident enough to actually try those things.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.640]   So that's what I respect.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.120]   More than like someone failing,
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.360]   it's the fact that they were confident enough
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.520]   to actually like go for it.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.320]   Like all the best players got to a point
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.960]   where they would just forget the naysayers,
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.480]   forget the people that say you shouldn't do this
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.520]   or shouldn't do that.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.720]   And just, you know, work on your game.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.040]   And if you fail, you fail.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.520]   - But like, just be vulnerable for a second.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.840]   'Cause I feel like now you're talking about it
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.720]   from the perspective of like, you've kind of been a rookie.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.760]   Like you've been in the league a few years
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.640]   and you have like more perspective on it.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.280]   But like when you first went into the league
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   and it was kind of a letdown to people
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.520]   because you weren't playing,
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.080]   was it harder for you to deal with negative comments then?
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.160]   - Yeah, but I think that's why like
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.400]   the hardest time for me was at Mizzou
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.080]   because that was the first time in my life
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.360]   where basketball didn't go how I wanted it to go.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.640]   And so I gained that mental strength like earlier on
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.400]   because of my injury in college.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.080]   But a lot of people don't go through the stuff
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.460]   that allows them to kind of develop that.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.600]   But yeah, no, every time I've had a surgery,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.520]   every time something has gone wrong,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.200]   like you feel those thoughts.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.640]   I've gotten better at dealing with them though.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.280]   Like better at just setting them to the side
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.040]   and just focusing on a goal.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.000]   But it's not easy at all.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.040]   That's probably the hardest thing
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.680]   about being a professional athlete.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.560]   Like I don't think being a professional athlete
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   is for everyone 'cause a lot of people would...
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.180]   Yeah, that's definitely the roughest part about it, I think.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.880]   - Someone asked, how and why did you stay away
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   from social media so long during the season?
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.420]   I'm sure it like ties in.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.340]   But I know you were kind of like on/off,
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.600]   but for most of the season you were off.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.520]   - No, I was off.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.640]   I only got back on I think in the finals
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.140]   'cause my agency really wanted me to get back on.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.440]   I just think like overall for me,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.280]   social media and like the day and age that we live in
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.280]   is like the cons outweigh the pros for me personally.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.880]   And probably a lot of dudes in general.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.960]   Like it depends like what you want out of life
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   and what you're trying to reach.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.360]   For me, I'm trying to walk in my faith
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   and I'm trying to be a man of integrity and like grow.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.280]   And I just feel like social media is a hindrance to that.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.560]   First of all, you see all this dope stuff going on.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.840]   You can get into like the comparison game of,
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.880]   man, this person seems like they're above me
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.400]   or this person got more followers than me or whatever.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.200]   But then it's also like as a dude,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.260]   one of our struggles is females
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.000]   and there's unlimited baddies on Instagram.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.200]   So like honestly, if I'm being 100%,
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.500]   if you were trying to focus and stay away from,
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.400]   like it could be a trap if that's your thing.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.120]   So I just, you gotta be self-aware.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.540]   If that's your thing that you could fall into,
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.600]   you can remove it for a while.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.480]   And for me, it helped me focus.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.640]   - Yeah, I think you talked about that
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.920]   with Lecrae on that episode.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.380]   Like you have to know your vice
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.480]   and then set up boundaries around it.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.640]   - And it's probably, you know,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.200]   I'm on a podcast with my sister.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.240]   You probably don't wanna hear that my vice would be females,
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.800]   but really that's most dudes' vice.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   Like if you don't get it in check,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.520]   and then obviously in this day and age,
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.520]   marriage is not like a super popular, like, concept.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.560]   But like one day I wanna have a wife, I wanna have kids.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.800]   So if you just are always in the habit of all these girls
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.920]   and all these new girls,
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.200]   and every time you go to Instagram, there's unlimited,
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.840]   like you'll never get to a place
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.320]   where you just can value like one girl.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.720]   I don't see how you can get to that place.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.760]   So for me, it's just better to remove it.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.480]   So I get on it like once in a while,
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.080]   but I don't have it on my phone.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.760]   I don't even know my Instagram password.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Like I got a Nicodemus, my manager, he has the password.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.720]   So he'll let me get on it once in a while, I'll check it.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.560]   - Good job.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.400]   - Thanks.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.880]   (laughing)
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.320]   - If you didn't play basketball,
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.520]   what do you think you'd be doing?
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.240]   Like if you've never touched a basketball,
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.040]   not just like you got hurt now and couldn't play,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.720]   but like it was never a part of your life
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.040]   and you didn't have like the money from the contract.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.840]   - If I didn't, who?
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.920]   I mean, I always tell people like,
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.080]   one thing about me is I never really had like a plan B.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.720]   Like I never really was one of those dudes
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.880]   that had a lot of hobbies.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.000]   Like I never really liked instruments.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.160]   I never even really liked video games.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.800]   It was always just like basketball.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.200]   So if I was not playing,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.600]   I probably would be trying to mooch off of one of y'all.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.480]   I probably would be trying to get on board
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.940]   with what you were doing
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.160]   or one of my other siblings were doing,
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   or I don't know 'cause I did not have,
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.560]   you know, I was smart in school,
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.160]   but I didn't have any like thing I wanted to major in.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.560]   - There's no like other side passions
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.640]   that you can think of? - No, there really wasn't.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.480]   - Yeah.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.580]   Okay, you might not like me for including this question.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.240]   - No, I want you to ask some of the crazy ones.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.680]   - Someone asked, are you aware
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.940]   of the Never Swing the Rock memes about you?
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.960]   - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.060]   On social media, you see what people say.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.160]   No, I'm aware of the little Michael
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   Never Swing the Rock Porter Jr.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.320]   I don't know who came up with that.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.280]   But to be completely honest,
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.520]   getting a lot of assists is not my role on the Nuggets.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.800]   Joker and Jamal, they play their two-man game.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.360]   If it gets swung out to me by one of those guys,
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.180]   I'm expected to shoot it.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.640]   I'm one of the best shooters in the league,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.940]   like humbly, like I can say that,
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.400]   but like I don't see contests.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.880]   So a lot, you might be watching on TV
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.300]   and see me shoot a contested shot,
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.040]   but it doesn't feel contested to me.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.880]   I might watch it like after I'm filming,
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.480]   I'm like, yo, I shot that.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.720]   But really, they don't feel contested
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.960]   and I make a lot of contested shots.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.240]   But I definitely, I see it.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.760]   But really, I'm not the one with the ball in my hands
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.920]   like I was in high school.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.160]   To win a championship, every player on a team
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   has to have a specific role.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.240]   And for me, it's like when I catch the ball,
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.960]   it's let it fly, you know what I mean?
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.640]   - I also do feel like the meme just kind of took off
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.160]   because I've seen you make great passes and great assists.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.040]   - You don't have to be nice.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.640]   No, I mean, I've always been able to make plays and pass,
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.960]   but on the Nuggets team,
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.560]   I'm not the one with the ball in my hands
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   the majority of the time.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.120]   So, you know, maybe one day if I'm on another team
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.000]   where the ball's put in my hands to make plays more,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.120]   there'll be more assists.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.500]   But right now, it's like, when I catch it,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.000]   I'm shooting or I'm driving.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.360]   And unless I'm crowded, it's probably going up.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.320]   And my teammates know that
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.400]   and they're going to tell me to shoot it.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.200]   So we just want a championship.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.280]   To win a championship,
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.640]   it's not like you can have guys playing selfishly.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.800]   So when I shoot the ball, it's not out of a selfish motive.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.880]   It's like, that's what my teammates want me to do.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.440]   That's my role on the team right now.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.160]   So let it fly.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.360]   - You heard it here first, folks, let it fly.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.840]   Okay, so we're going to kind of transition
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.080]   into more faith stuff.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.320]   - Yeah.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.480]   - Did this past season,
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.960]   I don't know if they meant season of basketball
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.320]   or just season of life,
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.840]   but did this past season challenge your faith in any way?
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.120]   And how did you keep God the center and the focus?
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I feel like in this day and age,
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.080]   your faith, regardless if you're a professional athlete,
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.800]   regardless of whatever,
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.360]   like your faith is challenged.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.880]   Like there's a lot of stuff going on in the world today.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.480]   So yeah, I mean, my faith was challenged.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.960]   I have like an unwavering belief in God.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.520]   Like that never goes anywhere.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.480]   And then, you know, I did my research
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.560]   to get to the point where I believe like Jesus
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.000]   is God.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.920]   But I think everyone should get to an age
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.200]   where they explore other religions,
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.080]   go learn for yourself what you want to believe.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.040]   Like you may have grown up a Christian,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.400]   but you don't know if that's what you want to believe.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.640]   You may have grown up a Muslim.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.840]   You may have grown up like whatever it is.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.160]   I think we all should reach an age
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.560]   where we figure out what we want to believe for ourselves.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.720]   So I did that, read things on other religion,
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.960]   you know, talk to people who were in other religions.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.320]   And I kind of got to the place where I for sure believe
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.440]   like Jesus is who he says he was.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.880]   So that's unwavering.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.920]   But in terms of like practicing like my faith
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.120]   and like always knowing if God is there,
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.480]   if he's watching me, if he's taking care of me.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.720]   You know, there's a verse that says like,
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.760]   everything works out for the good
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.560]   for those that love him.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.240]   And I think that type of stuff can get kind of like,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.920]   you know, you don't always fully believe it.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.440]   You just got to remind yourself of it.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.760]   And the other thing about the NBA is the schedule is so,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.560]   like we stay up late after games
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.400]   and you got to wake up early and go to the gym and things.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.600]   So the consistency in reading the Bible
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.840]   is kind of, it can be a hard thing,
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.560]   but I really do believe like there is power in the Bible.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.600]   And when I am in the word,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.400]   like when I'm reading it consistently,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.440]   like I definitely see it come about in my life.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   - So that kind of leads right into the next question.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.360]   Someone asked, how do you prioritize your walk
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.520]   with Jesus in the season?
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.440]   I know there's temptations on the road, they said,
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.760]   but, which is kind of funny,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.760]   but I feel like you were just talking about
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.800]   like how hard it is kind of with the change in schedule,
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.240]   because one of the best things is consistency,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.280]   but just gets tough.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.880]   - I think, yeah, it's always a priority to me
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.920]   in terms of like, I always wake up
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   and I listen to worship music before I listen to anything else
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.920]   but spending time in the word, it can get,
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.640]   you know, your priorities can get thrown off.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.120]   I think no matter what your job is,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.600]   no matter how busy you are, that should be the priority.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.800]   I'm not going to sit here and say like,
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.840]   it always like was for me,
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.320]   but I think that it is,
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.480]   overall it is the priority in my life.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.200]   And I think, yeah, on the road, it's tough.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.160]   You just got to have, like,
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.120]   I sometimes travel with people, you know, accountability.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.280]   It all depends like what you want.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.440]   Like there's some people that aren't trying to live, right?
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.200]   You, they want to do this and do that.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.400]   And I'm not going to sit here and say that I haven't
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.680]   like fallen into things or done things like,
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.760]   but it's, yes, I'm just be like, it's tough.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.840]   We have so much access.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.240]   We have so much money.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.520]   There's, you know, when you go to hotels,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.080]   there might be girls waiting in the lobby.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.480]   There might be this or that.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.600]   So really it's, you got to have accountability.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.720]   So I got good friends, you know, Nicodemus,
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.800]   my manager, he travels with me and he's like,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.200]   like I always say, you should have friends
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.520]   that are like on the same level as you
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.080]   in terms of just like discipline and things like that.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.720]   And then some friends that you're kind of helping out,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.920]   but you got to have some friends that are like
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.320]   more disciplined, more, more godly,
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.440]   more all these things than you.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.960]   And that's kind of what Nicodemus is for me.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.480]   So I bring him out there on the road and he helps me.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.720]   You know, he gets on me if he knows I'm staying up late,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.280]   if I'm kicking it with too many people, things like that.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.760]   - Yeah, that's smart to always just have someone
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.040]   like around you that you want to live,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.920]   like how they live and that inspires you.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.280]   Okay, what's your favorite scripture and why?
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.720]   I'm going to test your Bible knowledge.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.200]   - I'm about to say the first verse I can think of.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.480]   No, I think my favorite verse.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.720]   - It's okay if you paraphrase.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.920]   - Yeah, no, I just think it's like,
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.520]   I mean, there's so many good verses.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.120]   I like the...
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.400]   Hey, man.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.920]   - How are you going to take this question?
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.680]   (laughing)
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.200]   - No, because I know some verses.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.360]   - That's crazy.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.560]   - I know some verses, but I can't--
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.160]   - I will say, you have verses like all over your house.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.120]   - Yeah, I just can't think of what my favorite one is.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.200]   I seem like I'm just...
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.040]   That's crazy.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.160]   Yeah, yeah, go ahead and go to the next question.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.000]   - All right, all right.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.600]   So we're into life.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.080]   How do you balance confidence and self-doubt?
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.640]   - Yeah, confidence and self-doubt, it's a tricky balance.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.800]   I think any professional athlete could sit here
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.240]   and tell you that they're always confident,
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   but when you're in a slump or your shot's off,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.560]   what happened to me a couple games in the finals
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.320]   where my shot just fell off,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.200]   now you start overcompensating to try to fix it,
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.720]   but really you always could shoot,
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.800]   so why are you trying to fix it?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.120]   And then I was missing words once I started trying to fix it.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.680]   So I think there's times where you get in a rhythm
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.240]   and everything just feels really good
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.640]   and you're making shots.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.760]   There's other times where you're in little slumps
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.440]   and then you can start to think like,
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.560]   "Oh, is there something wrong with my shot?"
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.240]   And then the overthinking can make it worse.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.840]   So yeah, you gotta be confident in the work you put in.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.000]   That comes from just actually putting the work in,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.880]   like being in the gym more than everyone else
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.400]   so you can go out there and feel comfortable
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.840]   with your moves and things,
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.640]   but there are times where you go through little slumps
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.080]   and you just kinda...
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.960]   I wouldn't say you doubt yourself.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.200]   I never doubt myself,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.680]   but you just are kinda just like
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.800]   a little bit down on yourself sometimes.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.200]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   Do you, okay, I've never actually asked you this.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.280]   Someone asked, "How do you personally navigate anxiety
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.480]   "if you experience it?"
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.040]   Do you feel like you're an anxious person?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.440]   - No, I used to not think I was anxious at all.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.200]   Like when people would talk about anxiety,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.760]   I was like, "Yeah, you're weird.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.920]   "Why do you care so much?"
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.120]   But I think there's different type of anxiety.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.040]   People have anxiety attacks and things like that.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.960]   Their breathing gets short.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.440]   I never have that, but I just think overall in life,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.560]   sometimes I'm anxious about certain things.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.800]   If it's not going my way,
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.280]   if I don't know if the plans that I had
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.480]   aren't gonna work out.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.400]   Especially when you're not connected to God
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.840]   and you're not connected to your priorities.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.400]   If those aren't in check,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   you're obviously gonna be anxious about life.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.920]   So I have realized over the past year or two
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.000]   that there are times when I'm anxious.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.800]   Yeah, and then that affects everything.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.280]   That affects how you play, if you can play free.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.000]   That affects a lot of stuff.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.240]   So you just gotta be self-aware.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.400]   And now I know how to kinda get out of that.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   But no, I think anxiety is a real thing for a lot of people.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.440]   There's the scientific part behind it
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.480]   that I've kinda looked into.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.320]   Like the dopamine, if you're too much flooded
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.480]   with the dopamine, heavy doses of dopamine,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.680]   then you are likely to not be as,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.120]   there's all the scientific stuff that I've looked into.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.840]   But yeah, I would say overall, yeah,
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.360]   I have realized there are times in my life
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.880]   where I'm more anxious than others.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.600]   - What makes you feel the most free?
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.480]   - I think what makes me feel the most free would be,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.360]   when I'm, this is what I've realized.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.760]   When I'm proud of the person that I am off of the court,
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.960]   like I'm doing the right stuff,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.640]   like I'm prioritizing my faith walk,
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.760]   when I'm getting in the word,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.320]   when I'm not doing too much stuff that I feel guilty about
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.000]   or feel bad about doing, and I'm just a solid person
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.560]   that I'm doing what I say I'm gonna do,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.040]   I'm living with integrity.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.280]   When I'm proud of myself,
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.680]   then even if I'm having good or bad games,
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.360]   like you can balance the highs and the lows a lot better.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.280]   But if you are, and I was just talking to,
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.720]   I just got a therapist that I've been talking to
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.040]   a little bit, yeah, I've talked to him two times,
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.120]   and we actually were talking about this,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.120]   but it's like when you're not proud of yourself
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.040]   and you don't think God's proud of you,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.600]   now you gotta go out and try to perform your way
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.040]   into other people's approval
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.560]   or get your worth from other people.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.760]   But when you are living and obeying God
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.440]   and getting your, God always loves you,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.320]   you're always valuable to him,
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.340]   but when you actually can, for me,
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.800]   when I can feel proud of the person I am
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.920]   and I know God's proud of me as well
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.040]   'cause I'm doing what he says to do,
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.440]   then I'm not tripping about anyone else approving of me
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.520]   because I know I'm living right, you know what I mean?
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.720]   - Yeah, there is this Bible verse I'm gonna butcher,
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.560]   but it's like, I don't do what I wanna do,
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.120]   and then I do what I don't wanna do, or whatever.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.000]   I forget even what part of the Bible it is,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.840]   but I feel like--
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.660]   - I think it's Paul, yeah.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.120]   - Yeah, that literally speaks to that.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.200]   When you are living the way that you're called to live
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.700]   and you have confidence in yourself,
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.660]   you have trust in yourself that you're gonna walk out
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.740]   what you believe, your actions aren't conflicting
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.720]   with your mind and what you want to do,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.780]   you're just living a life of integrity,
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.300]   that is the most freeing thing.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.780]   - Yeah, which is, it's easier said than done.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.300]   That's one of the most, he wrote a lot of the Bible,
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.860]   but he's talking about, so he's obviously a very godly man,
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.700]   but he's also talking about, he does things
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.540]   that he doesn't necessarily wanna do,
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.100]   but we're human, we sin, we mess up,
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.300]   and that's what he's talking about.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.740]   He's doing things that he knows he shouldn't do,
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.700]   and that's where a lot of people can get stuck
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.020]   in the place of living a double life.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.720]   You wanna live one way, but you're living another way,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.620]   and when you are the person that you wanna be,
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.620]   like just single-minded, the person you wanna be
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.020]   is who you are, that's when I feel the most free,
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.500]   but there's times in my life where I feel like
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.340]   I'm that person, and you kinda can get away from it,
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.660]   like that's life, that's being human.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.820]   We're not perfect, so you gotta have grace with yourself,
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.020]   which is something I struggle with
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.780]   because I'm a perfectionist,
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.820]   but yeah, you gotta have some grace with yourself, too.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.380]   - Okay, what is something you have been
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.720]   personally questioning or pondering lately?
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:39.580]   Can be silly or serious, doesn't matter.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.600]   - One thing I have been questioning or pondering,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.540]   well, the most lately that's happened was last night,
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.900]   I was just sitting there eating some food,
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.380]   and I just was thinking, what is really,
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:03.940]   deeply the purpose of why I'm here, why we're all here?
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.320]   I was just thinking about that a little bit
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.060]   because I think some people just live life very blindly
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.780]   because they don't have a deep thought
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.820]   of a purpose for themselves and a deep purpose
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.780]   for why we're all here,
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.940]   which no one really knows why we're all here,
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.300]   which is a weird thought, too.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.500]   It's not like God needed us.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.960]   So it's like, why are we all here,
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.580]   but then why am I here?
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.500]   That's just a thought I was having last night.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.740]   And I've tried to figure out my purpose
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.420]   over this last while.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.860]   I mean, I think our purpose, all of our purposes,
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.100]   pretty much the same, like inspire others,
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.740]   lead others to God, things like that.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.660]   But then it's like, yeah, I don't know.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.980]   I just have very, very, that's the last thing I ponder,
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.020]   but you know me, I ponder.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.660]   That's why this is Curious Mike.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.000]   I ponder a lot of things.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.020]   - Yeah, you were debating that last night.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.180]   - Yeah.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.820]   - It's crazy that, I feel like everyone,
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.980]   that's their deepest question is purpose and meaning.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.700]   - Purpose, yeah, it really is.
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.020]   And it's weird because you can accomplish
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.620]   so many individual goals,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.180]   or you can do so much stuff
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.060]   to make yourself happy for a moment,
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.820]   but then beyond that, why are we really here?
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.820]   Like, what is, and yeah, it's just weird.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.780]   It's super weird.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.540]   And then I just think, yeah, I don't know.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.500]   I could go on a whole rant about deep stuff,
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.260]   but we'll save some stuff for another episode.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.060]   - Okay, let me just do one final question.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.420]   I actually submitted this question myself.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.260]   - Did you?
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.700]   - Yeah, I asked, when in your life
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.980]   have you been the most pure, happiest?
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.860]   And do you think the future will be even happier,
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.820]   or do you think you've experienced your happiest?
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.060]   - I think when we're kids,
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.700]   that's when we're our purest in happiness.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.740]   And I think that's why you read books
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:02.140]   and you hear therapists talk about find your inner child,
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.300]   because that's when we're our most pure,
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.860]   before we're tainted by the world,
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.500]   before we have aspirations that aren't the right aspirations
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.340]   and things like that.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.060]   So I sometimes think, can I ever get to that point
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.740]   back before I was kind of like,
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.900]   'cause we're all, in a sense, programmed.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.700]   Even if you're not programmed
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.580]   and you think you're outside of this,
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.580]   at the end of the day, we all have certain thoughts,
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.420]   patterns, and things that were put into us by the world.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.820]   And so can you escape that?
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.340]   And one of my plans to escape it,
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.660]   and this is something I've wanted to do
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.180]   ever since I was little,
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.220]   I think I told Bree about this,
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.100]   is like, 'cause it's weird,
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.580]   once you have money, it's just so weird,
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.380]   because once you have money,
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.900]   things that used to be exciting to you
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.220]   may not be exciting anymore,
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.540]   because you got used to 'em.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.820]   So it's like everyone really is on the same level
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.620]   of happiness because everyone just got used
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.740]   to what they have.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.940]   So if you're middle class,
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.580]   you got used to eating at certain restaurants,
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.820]   and then when you get to go to maybe,
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.500]   do you remember when we were poor growing up
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.620]   and we had our birthday dinners,
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.700]   like going to Noodles & Company
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.420]   was our special birthday meal?
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.380]   That's crazy to think about,
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.380]   but now if Noodles & Company was my meal for lunch,
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.540]   I'd be like, "Yo, I'm eating bad today."
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.500]   But that used to be our special meal,
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.860]   so one of my goals to kind of detach
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.260]   from the programming of that is,
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.220]   there's gonna be a year in my life,
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.660]   once my career's over,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.220]   where I live a very minimalistic life.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.980]   I'm not gonna live in one of my houses here in Denver.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.740]   I'm gonna get a super little house,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.460]   and I'm gonna only spend maybe,
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.020]   I'm gonna try to live on $1,000 a month,
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.700]   something that the lower class would do,
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.580]   just to kind of go all the way.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.660]   I've thought about maybe one day even trying
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.940]   to see if I could be homeless for a year.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.100]   Not a year, maybe not a year, a month, a month.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.660]   I think the homeless thing was a month,
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.260]   but live the minimalistic lifestyle for a year,
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.180]   'cause then think about going back to all your blessings.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.820]   You would appreciate them all over again.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.660]   - It would be so new.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.460]   Yeah, that's the thing, you just get used to it,
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.380]   and you don't see it for the blessing it is
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.500]   when it's just the everyday.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.740]   - And then you just are always searching for more and more.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.500]   That's why people that actually get what they,
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.740]   wanted in life as far as finances or whatever,
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.380]   sometimes they end up the most unhappy
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.460]   because they thought this thing far out
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.960]   was gonna bring them peace and bring them happiness,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   but it didn't, so I've realized that getting rich,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.540]   even winning an NBA championship,
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.300]   maybe being one of the best players in the NBA,
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.740]   that ultimately doesn't bring ultimate happiness and peace.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.880]   So I think that's one of my things I wanna do.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.300]   - Well, that's probably why you can,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.420]   like you said, those big accomplishments
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.420]   don't bring ultimate happiness and peace.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.780]   It's appreciating the everyday blessings around you
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.620]   that we get used to,
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.040]   but the people that, the janitors that you see
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.980]   that are so happy or the people living the lifestyle
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.260]   that you're talking about that are so happy,
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.460]   they've just found the hack
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.060]   of appreciating the mundane.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.300]   - Yeah, appreciating the process of life,
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.860]   what they do have, the blessings they do have.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.080]   It's weird how you can have so many blessings
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.880]   and so many things good in your life,
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.800]   but we always focus on the one thing that we don't have
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.000]   or we wish we had, and so I don't know.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.900]   I feel like that's like Western society programming,
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.080]   'cause I don't know if people,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.400]   I mean, you've been over there
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.480]   taking care of those little kids.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.120]   I don't know if they really live like that.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.720]   - I mean, I would say no from what I experienced.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.120]   Like, I feel like they were literally so happy
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.960]   and they live in a literal dirt hut smaller than this room,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.480]   like the whole family's in there.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.980]   - So that's why I say no matter how far detached
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.660]   you think you are, to an extent, we're all kind of programmed
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:04.220]   and I'm so thankful that I was homeschooled growing up
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.820]   because I think I'm less programmed than some people
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.020]   and I can think freer than some people,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.180]   but to an extent, we all are,
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.420]   so I wanna somehow figure out ways to detach from that
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:18.420]   and I think choosing to live in a way
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.100]   where I could live a certain way
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.220]   would be a cool way to do it,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.260]   but that's just a goal of mine.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.540]   Should I ask my curious question?
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.380]   - Oh yeah, go for it.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.620]   Should I step out of the frame
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.220]   while you talk with the people?
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.900]   - No, you don't have to.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.260]   So yeah, we're gonna start this new thing
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.260]   called Curious Questions
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.780]   and this is just something I'm curious
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.020]   about your guys' thoughts on, you know what I mean?
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.220]   This is called Curious Mike,
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.820]   so we talk openly about things.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.860]   My question for y'all for this episode
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.540]   is now that we're some time removed from COVID
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:59.660]   and the coronavirus is not as talked about
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.020]   and things like that,
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   what are your guys' thoughts on the virus, the vaccine?
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.340]   Did the vaccine help?
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.300]   Did it hurt?
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.460]   You know, you got some people that think
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.540]   the vaccine is the reason
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.100]   that we're not dealing with it as much.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.160]   You got other people who think
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.100]   people are dying from the vaccine
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.180]   or they're having complications with the vaccine.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.140]   So now that we're some time removed,
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.500]   I wanna know your guys' thoughts on that.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.180]   I'm actually one of like five or six NBA players
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.540]   that didn't get vaccinated.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.220]   - So few.
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.380]   - I don't know if it was like the best thing,
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.340]   not the best thing.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.420]   I think I did the right thing.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.260]   I got teammates telling me
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.700]   like they wish they didn't get vaccinated,
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.580]   things like that.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.260]   But there was a time where it was like so pushed
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.220]   and it was trying to be forced on us.
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.900]   So I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are surrounding that
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.260]   now that we're a little bit removed from that.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.580]   I'm excited to get back into Curious Mike.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.860]   I know it's been over a year.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.460]   You know, I was dealing with some injury stuff.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.720]   I couldn't find the motivation,
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.260]   but I appreciate you guys
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.820]   and we're gonna get back into it.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.020]   I'm gonna start recording episodes pretty often
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.620]   and just dropping them whenever I record them.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.220]   So that's how we're gonna do it from here on out.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.340]   If you guys have any guests that you wanna see me interview
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.740]   or any questions for me,
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.920]   I'll be doing solo episodes like this from time to time
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.900]   and we're gonna go from there.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.740]   So I'm gonna try to get it back cracking.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.000]   This is episode one.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.840]   Yes, sir.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.660]   - Good job.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.500]   - All right, that was good.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.980]   - Yeah, that was good.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.820]   - Are you sure?
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.880]   - Get it back cracking.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.780]   - I hope.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.340]   Sometimes I think I'm too open on these things.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.180]   But I mean, that's a point.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.020]   - That's the whole point, baby.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.620]   - That is the whole point, yeah.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.940]   It's not like I made it to try to keep like a...
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.060]   Like I made it so that I could just talk about
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.500]   spit how I wanna talk about.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.340]   - Yeah.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:39:03.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
