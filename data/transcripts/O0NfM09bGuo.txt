[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Food is the molecular building blocks of the body.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.280]   It is the cell-signaling functional molecules that tell our cells what to do.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   They act as transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, cell-signaling pathway intermediates,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.000]   and it's also, of course, the substrate to change what the microbiome does and the composition
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.360]   of the microbiome, which is basically a pharmacy inside our bodies to create different molecules
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.840]   that can affect our health.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.680]   So food is certainly a calorie is a calorie from the concept of thermodynamics, but from
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.760]   the concept of molecular information, it has three massively important parts that are unavoidable
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.800]   for creating cellular health.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.780]   So I would just say that that is the pillar that we can drill, be happy to drill into
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.360]   of like what do we really do to build as much metabolic health as possible.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.400]   >>AJ: Yeah, I want to focus now, if you're willing, on food, not just macronutrients,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.800]   proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, not just calories, although that as well, but things
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.540]   like timing, things like fasting, and micronutrients, which I think is a highly underexplored topic.
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.120]   So with respect to food, gosh, I feel like we've all been exposed to pretty much every
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.800]   variation of it's all calories in, calories out.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.280]   And by the way, I believe in the laws of thermodynamics.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.800]   So yes, total caloric load matters.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.820]   Total energy expenditure matters, without question, within the framework of not consuming
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.480]   excess calories.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.760]   There's a lot to explore, however.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.800]   I can just say for myself, for what it's worth, I'm not very hungry until 11 a.m., noon or
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   10.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.680]   I'm okay not eating until then, and just water, electrolytes, and caffeine does me just fine.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.840]   I can exercise, et cetera.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.320]   But once I start eating, I really enjoy eating, and I mostly like the proteins.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.240]   I like meat and fish and eggs, and I like cheese and vegetables and carbohydrates and
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   fruit and all of it.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   I like all the stuff.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.360]   And I tend to like single or few ingredient foods.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360]   I just naturally do.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.000]   So I've been lucky in that way.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.520]   But I know a lot of people like sandwiches, processed foods, things that are combinations
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.800]   of ingredients.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.440]   What do we know about kind of, I don't want to say optimal, but if one, we're going to
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.360]   explore different ways of eating for sake of adjusting these biomarkers in the right
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.620]   direction and improving metabolic health, is there kind of a generic jumping off point?
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.620]   Would most people, for instance, be wise to cut back on the total number of sugars or
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.300]   the total amount of sugar rather, perhaps reduce the amount of carbohydrate and replace
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.540]   it with some lean quality protein?
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.140]   I mean, are there generalizations that we can make, or is it really all just about not
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.740]   getting excessive calories and trying to get those calories from the most nutrient-rich
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.740]   sources?
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.460]   Well, just drilling in on two things you just said there.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.140]   So one thing you said that was interesting was that you're lucky that you like all of
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.140]   those foods.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.100]   And the second thing was, is it just about not getting excess calories?
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.580]   But I think what's interesting about both of those is that I would argue that the reason
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.640]   you like those foods is because you have given your body enough whole real foods that now
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.780]   everything in your biology, neurobiologically, your reward circuitry, your microbiome, your
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.140]   satiety hormone threshold, all of these are now basically creating a situation in which
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.740]   you like those foods.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.740]   And then the caloric thing fits into that because the reason we're eating excess calories,
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.900]   the reason chronic nutrition is happening, and the reason we are quite literally in the
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.740]   United States eating ourselves to death for the first time in human history is because
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.220]   we're not eating real food.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.900]   And we're eating 60% to 75% of our calories of ultra-processed, nutrient-depleted foods
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.380]   that fundamentally don't give our cells what they need.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.740]   And a real premise that I think is so important to realize is that our cells are brilliant.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.380]   And if the cells aren't getting what they actually need to function properly, they will
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:32.340]   drive you to eat until they get their needs met, unfortunately, because the ultra-processed
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.940]   food is designed to be highly addictive, and it's devoid of what the cells actually need
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.100]   for good function.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.720]   We end up eating ourselves into a grave, and now almost 80% of Americans are overweight
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   or obese.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.000]   Close to 50% of the country is obese.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.820]   We literally gloss over this as a culture.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.220]   It has become so normal in such a short amount of time, but I always think about the fact
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.980]   that like there are really no other animal species in the world that have obesity and
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.180]   chronic disease epidemics.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.180]   And they don't have social media.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.180]   They don't have experts.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.180]   They don't have PubMed.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.180]   They don't have the FDA.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.180]   They don't have the USDA.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.380]   They don't have any of it.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.740]   And they have somehow figured out a way to stay at a healthy weight and to not get heart
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.060]   disease, and it's because they're eating real food that meets the needs of their cells.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.380]   And so I think to just boil that down, the root cause of the problem is that we have
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.860]   a toxic food supply that's no longer filled with the molecular information that our body
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.620]   needs to know to be satiated and to function properly.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:43.300]   And so through the complex biology of satiety hormones and neurobiology and microbiome function,
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.840]   we are driven to eat so, so, so much more.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.620]   So truly the jumping off point for anyone on the quest to better health is to eat as
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.060]   much real, unprocessed food from good soil as possible.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.980]   Kind of really of any dietary philosophy they want, truly.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.460]   I think if someone's eating real, unprocessed food from good soil who is plant-based or
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.620]   who is keto, they are going to have such a higher chance of meeting their body's actual
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.740]   fundamental needs.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.220]   And the good thing about biomarker testing is they can track for themselves if they are
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.540]   having good cellular function with that strategy.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.740]   There's been studies that have panned this out.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.420]   We know that the more ultra-processed food you eat, the higher risk of obviously obesity
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.940]   but also chronic diseases are, but then of course there's an amazing study from Kevin
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.900]   Hall just recently where he basically locked people up at the NIH and for two weeks he
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.940]   had them eat ultra-processed food and for two weeks he had them eat real food.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:47.420]   And people ate 7,000 more calories in the two-week period when they were eating ultra-processed
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.860]   food versus the unprocessed food.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.100]   They were locked at the NIH?
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.100]   I mean...
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.240]   I've been to NIH quite a bit.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.900]   It's great for a day job or a day visit.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.240]   I don't know that I want to be locked there.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.180]   That sounds like the Stanford prisoner experiment.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.060]   I say this tongue-in-cheek and with such admiration for what he had to do, but I think it's so
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:13.060]   amusing that we have this totally frankenfood, toxic food system that's largely ultra-processed
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:19.580]   and it took amazing Kevin Hall to basically do an NIH-funded study where people, what
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:27.960]   I say by locked is that they were inpatients at the NIH and had unlimited access to food
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.380]   during each of those two-week interventions.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.020]   So it was two weeks of ultra-processed food, two weeks of unprocessed or minimally processed
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:40.700]   food and they could eat whatever they wanted, as much as they wanted in both groups and
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.060]   then they would weigh every single bite that was left on their trays.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.620]   They knew exactly, exactly how many calories they ate and literally just giving people
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.420]   this ultra-processed food, which is devoid of what our bodies need and therefore will
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.940]   drive people to eat more.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:03.260]   They ate 500 calories more per day for a total of 7,000 calories more in that two weeks and
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.580]   they gained about two pounds and then lost two pounds in the unprocessed group, which
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.740]   makes sense, of course, because a pound is about 3,500 calories.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:17.500]   So we have to do these kind of crazy studies just to prove what we kind of know is true,
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.820]   which is that this ultra-processed food environment that's cropped up over the past 50 years is
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.980]   an experiment that has failed.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.980]   It has failed.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.180]   You know, close to 45% of kids are overweight or obese now.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.100]   Like it's not working and that really is the root cause.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.740]   So I think a lot of food is about quality and how do we actually really meet the needs
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.940]   of the cells so that our satiety hormones get secreted and we naturally stop eating.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.460]   Because just telling people, "Eat less calories, but eat whatever you want," that just doesn't
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.140]   work.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:59.220]   We have to inspire the body to not want to eat excess calories, which we do by stimulating
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:06.180]   satiety hormones, helping the microbiome support that process, and then change our reward circuitry,
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.620]   which is done with nutrient-rich, the most nutrient-rich food we can possibly get.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.220]   And that's why I mentioned the soil because our food is drastically depleted of nutrients.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.820]   So when we look at that 70 metric tons of food we're eating in a lifetime, it's just
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.820]   fasting.
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.260]   That's the information for our body, what it's going to be built from, how it's going
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.260]   to function.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:32.180]   Well, right now, 60% to 75% is ultra-processed, so we slash the value because the ultra-processing
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.780]   just like slashes the nutrients.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:40.300]   We slash the value of that 70 metric tons and then we have crappy soil because our industrial
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.980]   agriculture system, which means the food, in some cases, has 70% less of key micronutrients
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.980]   in it.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.900]   So that 70 metric tons, what's actually useful for our body becomes so much smaller.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.140]   So what we want to do is basically expand the value of that substrate we're putting
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.560]   in the body, and that means real food, unprocessed, from good soil, meet the needs of the cells,
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.640]   naturally don't be hungry, maintain a healthy weight.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.220]   And something I talk about is that we could talk about nutrition, the biochemistry of
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:18.540]   nutrition all day, but in my review of the biology and the biochemistry, there's five
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.060]   main things I think we can strive for in our food that can really help meet the needs of
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.020]   our cells.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.340]   And when it really comes, there are obviously more things our body needs, but if we strive
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.700]   for these five things, we will ultimately, I think, eat a really healthy diet.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:40.700]   And that is fiber, omega-3s, adequate healthy protein, a good amount of probiotics, and
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.700]   high antioxidant sources.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.660]   And if we build our diet around knowing a few things in each of those categories that
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.620]   we really love and stock our kitchen with it and make our meals a mixing and matching
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:58.020]   of each of those components and we get a good amount of those, we will give the body a lot
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.820]   of what it needs to have mitochondrial health, reduce chronic inflammation, reduce oxidative
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.820]   stress.
