[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   [Music]
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.520]   We have talked in the past about fortune tellers, palm readers, necromancers, witches, and mediums.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.900]   It's pretty clear that these are all forbidden by God.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.240]   We covered that back in APJ 1052.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.160]   But here's a different angle on the question from Jeff in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.640]   "Dear Pastor John, I love the teaching of Providence and eagerly look forward to getting
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   my copy of your new book.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.320]   As a pastor, I battle a growing New Age practice among some Christians in the use of omens."
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.880]   I think that's the best way to label it.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.720]   In APJ 1580, you said, "As I look at the 10,000 tiny bubbles popping at the top of
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.600]   the foam of my diet, Dr. Pepper, I believe that every one of those bubbles is popping
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.120]   in accord perfectly with God's bubble popping plan."
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.640]   I totally agree with you.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.680]   However, it concerns me that some will use this to justify their belief that when they
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.280]   see a certain number over and over in one day, this is a prophetic message from God.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.400]   Or they will claim to see answers in cloud formations.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.200]   I know this all sounds silly, but these things are very real for some Christians who are
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.720]   always on the lookout for a sign from God.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.060]   Increasing people's trust in God's all-pervasive providence in all things is likely to amplify
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240]   this tendency.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.720]   So how do we wisely lead people into God's all-encompassing providence, especially those
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.000]   who will be tempted more than ever to draw out signs from all of life's circumstances?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.680]   I think the question that every lover of the all-pervasive providence of God should ask
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.960]   is this, "How shall I live my life so as to be found in the slipstream of God's providence
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.280]   with the fullest knowledge of God, the greatest love of God, and bearing most fruit for the
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.160]   eternal good of other people for the glory of God?"
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.360]   I think that's the question.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.960]   You remember what a slipstream is.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.880]   It's when you get behind a boat or a car or a bike or an airplane and you are drawn forward
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.760]   into the direction of the one that you're following by the very force of the slipstream
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.040]   that, as it were, reaches back and grabs you and pulls you along.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.760]   So what we're asking is, "How shall I find myself drawn along in the slipstream of God's
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.520]   all-governing providence in such a way that we know him most fully, we love him most deeply,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.600]   we bear the most fruit for the eternal good of other people, and all for the glory of
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   God?"
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.360]   And I see two possible answers to that question.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.440]   First, the wrong one, the unbiblical one.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.960]   We can live by trying to read the providence of God as if the hundreds of events that befall
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.840]   us each day had messages in them which we're supposed to decipher so that as providence
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.280]   befalls us, it becomes a series of codes showing us how to think and how to feel and which
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   way to go.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.840]   So that's one answer to how to get into the slipstream of providence.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   Here's the second one.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.520]   I think this is the biblical answer.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:41.680]   We can live in the slipstream of God's merciful, all-governing providence by orienting our
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:51.840]   entire life toward understanding the revealed will of God in his Word, not a secret, hidden
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:01.760]   will in the coating of clouds and coincidences, and by availing ourselves of all the biblically
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.080]   appointed means of grace like corporate worship and pastoral teaching and brotherly correction,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:16.000]   and by being transformed in the spirit of our minds, like Ephesians says, so as to discern
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.600]   moment by moment the way of truth and love.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.240]   In other words, the Bible teaches the doctrine of God's providence not in order to lead us
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:38.060]   away from the revealed will of God in his Word, but in order to give us confidence that
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.160]   if we follow the revealed will of God in his Word, providence will work everything together
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.800]   for our eternal good.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.960]   That's why it teaches it.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.840]   Let me say it again.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.880]   Providence is taught in the Bible, not as an alternative way of assurance and guidance
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.680]   different from the revealed Word of God, but as the ground of our assurance that if we
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.040]   are guided by God's Word, we will be found in the slipstream of God's sovereign blessing
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   forever.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:20.320]   I say this not only because there are such strong warnings in Scripture against fortune-tellers
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:28.920]   and interpreters of omens, Deuteronomy 18.10, but even more because the way of life that
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.320]   Jesus and the apostles teach us is rooted in the Word of God.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.200]   "Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.520]   Your Word is truth," John 17.17.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.420]   And the transformation of our minds, Romans 12.2, and the spirit of our minds in righteousness
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.840]   and holiness, Ephesians 4.23.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:01.000]   Jesus and the apostles don't encourage us to look for personal coded messages in providence
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.520]   for how to live our lives.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:12.920]   Now let me mention four reasons why we should not use providence as a coded language for
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   the living of our lives.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.840]   Number one, we don't have the knowledge or the wisdom required for this.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.400]   Just when you think that three circumstances or three natural signs have lined up to point
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.680]   to a certain direction of behavior and have a certain meaning, God sees a thousand factors
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.880]   that you don't see that put a completely different meaning on those three that you do see.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.320]   In other words, presuming to interpret providence for the guidance of your life is presumptuous.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   You don't have enough knowledge or wisdom.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.680]   Number two, providence is not given as the ground of our faith in Christ.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.720]   Seeking to bolster confidence in the truth of Christ, the truth of Christianity, with
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.880]   circumstantial providential confirmations is often a sign that the eyes of the heart
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.120]   are becoming dim, like getting spiritual cataracts.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.760]   The battle for assurance, the battle to see the self-authenticating glory of Christ in
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.280]   the gospel is a battle for the eyes of the heart to see his glory in the Word, not a
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.880]   battle to see coded confirmations in the circumstances of the world.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:50.000]   Everybody struggles at times with doubt and uncertainty, and God has given us means of
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.840]   graceâ€”prayer, the Word of God, the witness of the Spirit, the fellowship of the saints.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.080]   These are the weapons we use to bring renewed illumination to the eyes of our heart.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   Ephesians 1:17, "Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the Word of God."
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:18.160]   Providence buttresses our Word-awakened faith by showing that nothing can stop the promises
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.180]   of God from being fulfilled.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:30.640]   Number three, very often the desire to find coded meaning in natural phenomena or circumstantial
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:41.000]   coincidences is a desire that flows from the pride of possessing private knowledge that
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.920]   others don't have.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.780]   We've all tasted this.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:50.560]   This kind of pride is the fuel that keeps gossip going.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.880]   For example, I have some inside knowledge that others don't have, and, oh, it feels
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.760]   so good to be in the know with just a few key people.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:08.400]   So we should ask ourselves, "Am I dissatisfied with the Word of God, the Bible, which everybody
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.440]   has access to because I don't want to be lost in the crowd of just any old ordinary Bible
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.060]   reader?
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:22.680]   I want to have my own special private source of revelation so that I can feel set apart
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.240]   and special."
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:33.840]   Number four, finally, I think one of the main reasons that the Bible is so adamant in rejecting
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.560]   omens and sorcery and fortune-telling and mediums and divinationâ€”in Deuteronomy 18,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:50.360]   for exampleâ€”is that all of these ways of trying to read Providence fail to do precisely
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:57.760]   what the prophets and apostles made central, namely, the prophets and apostles revealed
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:05.720]   God and his ways by relating everything to the character of God, the nature of God, the
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.920]   personhood of God, the wisdom of God, the justice of God, the love of God.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.760]   And they made plain that such revelation is only possible because God himself gives it
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   by his Spirit through his Word and that any other claim to know God and his ways is really
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:34.320]   an attempt to replace God's ways and ultimately to replace God.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:42.760]   So I would plead with all the lovers of the all-pervasive, all-embracing, all-governing
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:53.800]   providence of God, don't replace the infinitely precious Word of God with your puny, fallible
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.440]   capacities to decode the infinitely complex providence of God.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:08.080]   While this age lasts, the paths of providence will be a mystery, but his Word will be a
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.840]   lamp to our feet and a light to our path.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.000]   Wow, that is such a good, strong warning here, Pastor John.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   My takeaway line from this episodeâ€”I love this oneâ€”we live in the slipstream of God's
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.320]   all-governing providence by orienting our entire lives toward understanding the revealed
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:35.040]   will of God and his Word, not a secret, hidden will in the coding of clouds and in coincidences.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.040]   Such a great reminder.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.520]   Pastor Jeff, thank you for the great question.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.540]   Many of our best questions come in from pastors, so pastors, send us your toughest questions
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:49.200]   at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.960]   Speaking of God's all-governing providence over all things, next time we are going to
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.060]   ask a very sobering question.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:04.760]   Why would God design a baby to live for just two minutes?
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.120]   That's not a hypothetical question I know, even for many of you who are listening right
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   now.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   Why would God design a baby to live for just two minutes?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120]   That's next time.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.280]   When we return on Wednesday, I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.840]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   [END]
