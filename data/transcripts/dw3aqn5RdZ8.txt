[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280]   - I don't know when you're gonna hear this episode,
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.220]   but it's initially launching online on a Monday,
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.780]   commonly a day off for pastors.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.760]   And we have a question from a stay-at-home mom
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.960]   who writes us, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.120]   "I'm a stay-at-home mom to three darling daughters
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.020]   "under five and also a pastor's wife as well.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.300]   "Like most pastors, my husband takes Mondays off
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.720]   "to recharge, but I find there's never a day off
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.640]   "I can take off from laundry, dishes, cleaning, et cetera.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.700]   "The work never ends for me, and I find this to be
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.560]   "a challenge for a lot of moms who are feeling burnt out.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.280]   "Without questioning the value of our husband's day off,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.480]   "should moms get a day off too?
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.200]   "Should we try, or is this a selfish request?"
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.720]   - Whether it's a selfish request, I can't tell,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.400]   because I don't know your heart.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.860]   God does, but it certainly doesn't have to be
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.400]   a selfish request, and I don't assume it is.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.840]   It may be the same as the question that my wife and I
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.840]   posed at church and with the staff, at home,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.800]   during my pastorate, over and over.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.640]   How do we find, how does the staff find,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.720]   how do we as a couple find the pace to finish the race?
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.520]   That's the way we put it.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.120]   The marriage race, the parenting race.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.900]   They are marathons, not 100-meter dashes.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.220]   Noelle and I have been running the marriage marathon
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.960]   for 50 years, as of last December.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.480]   And the parenting marathon, we've been running for 47 years,
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.140]   and believe me, you still run the parenting marathon
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.960]   after your kids are grown and you've got 14 grandkids.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.280]   And we ran the pastoring marathon for 33 years.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.360]   So the question for all of us, moms, single moms,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   husbands, single dads, how do you find the pace
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.680]   to finish the race?
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   That's the question.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.140]   We don't want to loiter on our heavenly journey,
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.760]   and we don't want to fall exhausted halfway through.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.840]   That's not a selfish question to ask.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.920]   It's a wise one to ask.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   How can I find the pace to finish the race?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   So whether it's a day off or some other configuration
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.960]   of off and on, work and rest, sustaining rhythm,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.500]   here are five observations
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.320]   that might prove helpful to think about.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.320]   Number one, the Sabbath principle was God's idea
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.380]   before there was a fall into sin,
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.000]   before there was a fall with all the added burdens
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.920]   that the fall brought.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.320]   One day in seven, different from others,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   not the same pressured work, but relief and spiritual focus
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   to say to the Lord, "I am not God.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.160]   "You are God."
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.280]   If I stop upholding the universe
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.760]   by the word of my power for one day,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.940]   it's not gonna go out of existence.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.980]   I'm not God.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.820]   To say on that day to your own body,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.980]   "You're not superhuman, body.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.680]   "God is."
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.840]   That principle, one day in seven,
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.360]   to be honest with God and humble with God
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.900]   and restful with God, that principle was true
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.800]   for all the people of God, men and women.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.540]   So husbands should take the lead.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.940]   I'm gonna assume this in every one of these questions.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.100]   Husbands should take the lead
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.980]   in helping the family think through
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.380]   what that will look like for them all
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.700]   as the kids are growing up, including mom.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.380]   If all seven of mom's days are the same,
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.380]   something is amiss, given the Sabbath principle.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.080]   Number two, recognize that marriage and children
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.420]   and ministry will have different seasons
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.180]   with very different pressures.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.460]   Children under two present a different challenge
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.460]   than three to six and six to 13 and so on.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.300]   Every season is demanding, but not in the same way.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.380]   So if one feels unbearable,
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.940]   I was just talking to a young fellow
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.380]   over at Desiring God today who's got a brand new baby
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.460]   and he said, "I never knew it would be so hard."
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.820]   And mainly he had in mind sleep.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.460]   Where are we gonna get enough sleep
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.760]   to function the way we need to?
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.460]   It may help to remember in those seasons,
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.260]   this season is gonna be over.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.880]   Someday it will be over and we just need to find the pace
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.100]   to get through this part of the race.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.340]   Idea number three, husbands take responsibility
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.660]   for knowing your wife.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.940]   Peter says, "Live with her according to knowledge."
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.180]   She is a fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.180]   which means study her, listen to her, watch her,
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.140]   discern how you can help her flourish, be maximally fruitful.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.540]   That's what you want for her, flourish.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.260]   How can she be maximally fruitful and happy
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.140]   in her calling as a homemaker and mother
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.420]   and all the other aspects of her church and community life?
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.620]   That help will probably include daily relief of some kind
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.260]   from you for her and periodic relief of more extended time.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.860]   For example, I aimed as a young pastor with four kids,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   I aimed to get home or to come out of my study at home
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.420]   before supper at 5.30 and from rounding up the children,
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.100]   four boys at one time and Talva came along later,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.520]   but boys were out of the house by then.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.460]   So we had four at one time, four boys at one time
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.060]   and rounding them up for supper at 5.30
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.140]   and until seven o'clock,
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.440]   the children were my responsibility.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.400]   We called it playtime.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.720]   Noel might work or she might rest,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   she might read or she might do the dishes.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.240]   She'd do something, whatever she wanted to do,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.240]   she did between 5.30 and seven.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   But at least for that hour and a half,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.840]   I lifted that part of the day's load.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.300]   On vacation, we traded off.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.620]   She took the kids in the morning,
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.200]   let me read till noon, we ate together.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.360]   I took the kids in the afternoon.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   She went off and visited the town and visited bead shops
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.600]   or lay down by the lake or whatever she wanted to do.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.560]   She was free to do what she wanted to do alone
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.600]   and I was playing wiffle ball with the kids
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.240]   for four or five hours.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.800]   And then in the evening,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   there was all family time until the kids went to bed.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.660]   Now, there were other times when I would see to it
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.660]   that she could go with her friends,
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.400]   go on the women's retreat.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.180]   And the point is,
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.860]   husband's leadership does not mean
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.500]   making endless demands on your wife.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.900]   Can we be done with that notion of what leadership,
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.900]   when I talk about a husband's calling is to be a decisive,
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.620]   uniquely responsible leader in the family.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.620]   That's not leadership to make incessant demands.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.480]   That's an immature tyranny.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.860]   Leadership means know her,
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.360]   be creative in putting into place strategies of renewal
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.200]   that work for both of you.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.160]   Take the initiative to do that,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.080]   see that they get carried through.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.880]   Number four, be open and on the lookout
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.360]   for multiple families and relatives and neighbors
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.280]   to help in caring for the children.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.940]   This is especially relevant for single parents, right?
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.840]   It's that's a given, you know,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.620]   we should feel very jealous to be helpful
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.720]   between families for those who have,
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.560]   for all kinds of reasons run into difficult circumstances
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.120]   that are seasonal.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.260]   The nuclear family is God's idea,
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.500]   but the isolated family is not God's idea.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.680]   A mom who feels isolated and trapped
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.760]   in the walls of her home is probably not going
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.580]   to be emotionally and spiritually healthy.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.880]   When Hillary Clinton, let's dare to quote Hillary Clinton,
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.800]   when Hillary Clinton said,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.680]   "It takes a village to raise a child,"
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.480]   she wasn't making that up.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.360]   That's an ancient proverb.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.760]   It's an ancient wisdom.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.620]   Everywhere, children need more than mom and dad.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.620]   Children need other human beings.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.520]   So husbands, more leadership here.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.440]   How's the family doing in its wider network
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.360]   for the good of the children and the relief of the mom
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.600]   as we all share in the raising of our kids
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.400]   and help each other bear one another's burdens?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.080]   Number five, I want to make a special appeal
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.460]   to young moms and dads that you give the energy
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.600]   and focus and consistency of effort
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.480]   while your children are under two
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.560]   to build into them the habit of obeying
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.180]   on the very first directive that you give them.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.760]   No whining, no disobedience allowed.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.600]   You will do what you're told on the first request.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   Now this requires a huge outlay of focus
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.000]   and attention and courage and wisdom and energy
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.720]   and love when the children are very small
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.520]   because it's just easier to stay on the couch
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.560]   and let the child disobey three times in a row
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.680]   'cause you're too lazy to get up and do any enforcement.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.680]   So I'm saying it's a long, hard job, but oh, the payoff.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.240]   - Yes.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.900]   - Oh, it's so beautiful to see later on.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.100]   Now I could argue for this
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.600]   because the Bible says children obey your parents.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.000]   That's not rocket science.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.200]   That's what it says.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.180]   And they don't do that naturally.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.480]   And parents bring them up in the nurture
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.960]   and discipline of the Lord.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   But my point here is that for the sake of mom's sanity
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.440]   and health and strength,
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.160]   dad, help her raise obedient children.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.300]   It's amazing to me that so many parents
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.680]   of young children don't require obedience.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.080]   Seems crazy to me, insane.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.920]   - Yeah, how totally?
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.680]   - How to make your life miserable for 15 years.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.220]   No wonder everyone is dead tired.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.240]   It's simply exhausting to follow a child around
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.360]   trying to keep them from killing themselves
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.840]   because they won't do what you tell them to do.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.200]   I'm gonna say this, you can, yes, you can require
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.360]   your children say under six, seven, eight years old
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.440]   to go to bed at seven o'clock.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.960]   Yes, you can.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.540]   I don't care what they're made of.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.280]   You can require that.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.780]   And they don't get out of bed unless the house is on fire.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.760]   They're gonna encounter dad's wrath
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.080]   if they get out of bed, if they don't smell smoke.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.080]   I say this not to add burdens, but to lift them.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   Imagine what an emotional burden is lifted
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.840]   if children simply do what they are told
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.400]   the first time you tell them to do it.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.440]   That takes enormous focus and effort and love
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.120]   and follow through and discipline
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.100]   in the first two years of life.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.840]   So dads, this is your agenda.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.720]   Know your wife, know your children,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.080]   know your Bible, know yourself,
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.160]   and make sure your wife has what she needs
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   to be fruitful and happy as a wife and mother.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.140]   - Yeah, good words from the marathon of parenting.
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.420]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.480]   What is the goal of a sermon anyways?
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.680]   We'll see you Wednesday.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.840]   (silence)
