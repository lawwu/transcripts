[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.720]   All of a sudden, their nuclear scientists, the ones who'd worked on their bombs, were free to talk.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:23.200]   And we went to various apartments where retired guys from the bomb program were living on, as far as I could tell, a sack of potatoes and some salt.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.160]   They really, you know, they had government pensions and the money was worthless all of a sudden.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:40.800]   I was buying photographs from them, partly because I needed the photographs, and partly because I thought, I mean, 20 bucks was two months' income at that point, so it was easy for me and it helped them.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:55.360]   And in turn, they told me about, by 1947, they had a design for a bomb that they said was half the weight and twice the yield of the Fat Man bomb.
