[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]   you've interviewed a lot of millionaires, billionaires.
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.300]   What are some of the lessons you've learned
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.500]   from all those conversations?
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.480]   - I've also worked for them.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.020]   One thing I've noticed is that I think we all imagine
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.780]   that they're better than us.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.540]   And when you actually meet millionaires
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.340]   or multimillionaires or billionaires,
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.020]   nope, not really.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.700]   And that's beautiful, right?
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.100]   'Cause that means that everyone has a chance
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.600]   to create whatever life they want.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.480]   There are gifted people.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.940]   Like Zuckerberg is definitely smarter than most people.
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.100]   Bill Gates who I've worked for is smarter than most people.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.620]   Peter Thiel who I've gotten to hang out with a little bit,
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.940]   smarter than most people.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.220]   But there's also a lot of billionaires, Larry Janeski.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.380]   I would say he's very smart,
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.140]   but he's also a pretty normal guy.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.580]   Now, I would say some of the things in common between them
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.980]   is that most of them got rich off one thing,
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.120]   but all of us diversify.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.140]   It's actually counterintuitive.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.180]   They're like, "Diversify, diversify."
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.860]   But they only really got rich one way.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.700]   It's either real estate or it's tech.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.420]   Outside of inheritance, it's almost exclusively one thing.
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.100]   They stick with it for extraordinary long periods of time.
