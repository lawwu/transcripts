[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   How do you define confidence?
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.180]   There's like your confidence for yourself.
[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.440]   I can handle whatever happens,
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.360]   but I discovered that there's a cap on that.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.560]   Like how joyful and awesome our lives can be.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.320]   There's a ceiling on self-confidence
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.240]   and to go higher into really thriving in life,
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.520]   I think we need to have confidence
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.400]   in something beyond ourselves.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.880]   Whatever you wanna put in that box, I don't care.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.760]   But that's the kind of belief that's tapped into that.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.840]   Hey, even out of the challenging experience,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.760]   something extraordinary is gonna come.
