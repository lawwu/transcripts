[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360]   - Greetings radicals.
[00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.240]   On today's show, I'd like to tell you about
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.280]   a very worthy charitable relief effort
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.000]   that I myself have had the privilege of being involved in
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.040]   for almost five years now,
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.320]   and ask you to consider making a financial donation
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.980]   to this work.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.560]   I'll describe all the details as we get into the audio here,
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.360]   but put simply, I've been involved for, again,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   almost five years with a variety of relief efforts
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.080]   in the South American nation of Venezuela.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.520]   And that has taken a number of different shapes
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.520]   over the years, again,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.700]   as I'll tell you about in a few minutes.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.920]   Currently, the most productive and effective effort
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.960]   that I've been involved in
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.760]   has been to provide food relief and agricultural relief
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.560]   by helping with gardening supplies
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.680]   to plant large gardens
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   in various Venezuelan penitentiaries,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.720]   where there are many men, primarily men,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.680]   men and women imprisoned
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.720]   in these Venezuelan penitentiaries.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.600]   And the opportunity and the need
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.280]   has now exceeded what I myself can give
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.100]   out of my own personal financial resources.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.680]   So I'm bringing the request to you
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.780]   and asking you to contribute.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.520]   Links are in the description
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.680]   where you can go directly and make a credit card donation
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.040]   or use PayPal, whichever is easier for you.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.480]   That money will get directly to me.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.540]   And as I'll describe in the audio coming up here,
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.160]   I'll describe what I'm gonna do with the money
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.240]   and all those details.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.320]   But if at any point in time you're ready to give,
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.960]   please just go to that link and make a donation.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.000]   Let me begin with a little bit of backstory
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.160]   and I'll continue on from there
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.200]   to share with you a little bit about the current work.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.040]   Longtime listeners to Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.480]   know that I've had the opportunity to be involved
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.320]   in a variety of different ways
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.120]   with some very important and effective relief efforts
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.060]   serving Venezuelan refugees.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.100]   I've had a great interest in Venezuela.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100]   Ever since 2005, when I was in college in 2005,
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.120]   in a study abroad program in Costa Rica,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.400]   I had a professor who extolled the virtues of Venezuela
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   at that time as basically being the ideal expression
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.820]   of what a modern economy should be.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.320]   This professor was an extremely left-wing professor
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   and I was being confronted with the philosophical claims
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.620]   in favor of leftism.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.700]   And at that time, Cuba and Venezuela
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.160]   were being held before me
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.100]   as the paragons of modern development,
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.540]   how all nation states should function.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.500]   And of the two, although all of the woes of Cuba
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   were being blamed on the US blockade of Cuba,
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.700]   many of the benefits of Cuba
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.380]   were being extolled again and again,
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.560]   and Venezuela was being held out as the ideal example
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.680]   of how a country can flourish
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.040]   under a leftist system of government
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.840]   if not being blockaded by another nation.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.880]   Venezuela at that time was the wealthiest country
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.440]   in South America, very high standard of living,
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.280]   all kinds of stuff,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.560]   stuff that I could hardly believe at the time.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.900]   Well, fast forward after I returned to the United States,
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.880]   I started to hear a few years later
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.480]   about a massive economic crisis
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.320]   and being one who paid a lot of attention
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.440]   to economic crises.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.380]   When I heard one year
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.100]   that there was a million percent hyperinflation
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.360]   in Venezuela, I could hardly believe it.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.860]   And I started to follow it more closely,
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.860]   and Venezuela went through a terrible economic crisis
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.940]   with just terrible hyperinflation.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.140]   And going back about five years now,
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.540]   I started to be involved with some people
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.460]   who were taking part in various refugee relief efforts.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.400]   All across Venezuela, people were starving,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.940]   and there were thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.180]   of refugees leaving Venezuela,
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.860]   people just literally leaving
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.140]   with their children on their backs
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.300]   and walking out of the country
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.380]   to try to go and find any life anywhere else
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.620]   that they could put together where they could find food.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.780]   And at the time, again, I talked about this
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.980]   in past episodes, but at the time,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.540]   it started with where I first became aware of it
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.780]   was the refugee relief efforts.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.080]   And the situation for Venezuelan refugees
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.900]   was absolutely horrendous.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.580]   There was incredible poverty, incredible sickness,
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.020]   and there were huge, huge flows of refugees
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.060]   coming out of Venezuela at that time.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.820]   Again, people fleeing absolute starvation.
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.820]   I was able to be connected with a relief effort
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.120]   that where, I have to be careful
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.660]   with some of the details here,
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.500]   a relief effort where a huge quantities of food
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.900]   were shipped in from abroad,
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.380]   and a lot of that food we were able to get into Venezuela.
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.280]   But most of the work was involved with refugee relief.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.940]   And at the time here in Radical Personal Finance,
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.780]   we raised a significant sum of money
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.380]   to provide for refugee relief.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.180]   And that sum of money was used to purchase food,
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.820]   was used to purchase a vehicle
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.340]   for some people who were involved at the border,
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.920]   and providing specific relief
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.260]   to many, many Venezuelan refugees
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.740]   that were at that time coming out of the country.
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.620]   Now, the refugee flows have gone back and forth
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.180]   over the years.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.420]   Sometimes they've been higher,
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.180]   sometimes they've been lower,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.220]   and there have been a variety of ongoing efforts
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.420]   and needs of refugees.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.660]   What has happened though,
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.660]   is that almost anyone who was able to get out of Venezuela,
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.420]   got out of Venezuela.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.120]   And as the countries around Venezuela,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.160]   there in South America,
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.660]   basically reached their capacity for refugees,
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.660]   many of the refugees headed north.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.120]   There was a huge flow about a year or so ago
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.440]   of refugees heading for the border of the United States.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.280]   Many of them have gone to the United States,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.500]   tried to get into the United States
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.680]   under the very lax immigration policies
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.160]   that the United States has had in place
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.720]   for the last couple of years.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.940]   And it's been a nightmare
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.420]   for so many people in that situation.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.540]   Point remains just that the refugee thing
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.340]   was a separate work
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.340]   that I've continued to be involved with over the last years,
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.940]   but the initial fundraising
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.580]   that I did here on Radical Personal Finance
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.820]   was sufficient for the need
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.380]   and sufficient for the opportunity.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.900]   Now, what happened is through the contact
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.100]   that originally started with refugee relief,
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.700]   there were a variety of contacts made
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.880]   by some of the people that I'm involved with
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   to start to work inside of Venezuelan prisons.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.320]   Now, for my primarily North American audience,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.440]   the way that prisons work in South America
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   and in much of the world is very different
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.920]   than the way that prisons work in North America.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.080]   First of all, it's difficult to ascertain
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.820]   the actual guilt or innocence of prisoners.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.800]   Many prisoners are locked in prison
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   because they're guilty of terrible crimes.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.560]   However, many prisoners are locked in prison
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.400]   because they are political prisoners
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.600]   and they are supporters of the wrong political party
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.280]   or the wrong political position,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.000]   and so they get locked up.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.840]   I have heard many stories
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   of people who have been locked up for years.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   There are no charges against them.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.120]   There are no charges against them.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.240]   There are no,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.800]   there's no, their case is not being heard.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.440]   They can't get a trial date,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.760]   and they're just locked up in prison
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.960]   for a significant amount of time.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.800]   Now, it's a mixture.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.500]   Don't let me, hear me clearly.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.340]   I'm not trying to say
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.960]   that everyone who's locked up in a prison is innocent.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   That's absolutely not true.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.240]   What I am saying is, first of all,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.540]   if you have any hesitations about supporting prisoners,
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.360]   which I don't believe you should,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.080]   we should all support prisoners
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.080]   and provide relief for them.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.320]   I'll save comments,
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.400]   further social commentary for another day,
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.120]   but a lot of times people are uncomfortable with,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.520]   well, if someone's guilty of a crime,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.960]   then he deserves to suffer.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.280]   Well, it's a very mixed up situation.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.220]   The other aspect of the prison system in South America
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.160]   that's very different
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.240]   than the prison system in North America
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.740]   is quite simply that prisoners are locked up,
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.240]   and yet they are entirely reliant
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.740]   on outside family and friends to support them.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.820]   And so there's not, for example,
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.560]   the government doesn't provide food in the prisons,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.060]   at least not substantial amounts of it.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.340]   You can't go to prison and think,
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.660]   well, at least the government's gonna give me
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.900]   three square meals a day and a bed to sleep in.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   No, on the contrary,
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.300]   you're gonna get locked up in prison,
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.620]   and if your friends and family members don't bring you food
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.900]   and don't bring you money to buy food,
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.900]   then you're going to starve.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.780]   And the levels of hunger and disease
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.940]   and all kinds of issues in many prisons
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.620]   throughout Latin America are absolutely staggering
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.120]   and heart-wrenching.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.380]   It's really, really bad.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.380]   And these people have basically no opportunity.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.860]   Well, a number of years ago,
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.860]   there was a prison riot in Venezuela,
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.860]   and some people that I am in contact with
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.980]   had the opportunity to negotiate a peaceful settlement
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.980]   to the prison riot.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.620]   The prisoners had taken over the prison,
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.460]   all of the authorities were outside.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.140]   Last time this happened, there was a massacre,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.300]   and lots of people died.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.300]   This time around, we were able to negotiate
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.980]   a peaceful settlement to it and avoid a massacre
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.780]   by the police and the soldiers outside of the prison
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.300]   of the prisoners who had taken over the prison.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.880]   And so this provided a foothold into some of the work
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.580]   that was available in Venezuelan prisons.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.980]   Years ago, when President Hugo Chavez had come to power,
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.060]   he had expelled all Christian aid work
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.740]   and Christian missionaries out of the prison system
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.740]   because of his concerns about political work.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:35.440]   And because of the work of successfully negotiating
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   an end to the prison riot,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.540]   there was a door that was opened up again
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.700]   for Christian missionaries and pastors
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.300]   to go back into the prisons and start to build churches
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.580]   and try to bring people together in Christian churches
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.860]   within the local prisons.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.540]   And so this led to a lot of different things.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.380]   But along the way, one of the things
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.380]   that we started to work at was to use the grounds
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.860]   around the prison to plant gardens, large gardens,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.100]   with the goal of helping the prisoners to grow food
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.420]   so that they could provide for themselves
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.260]   and make a little bit of money and have a productive,
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.900]   some amount of productive work to keep themselves occupied.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   And so it's basically being run as a small business of sorts,
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:39.280]   like a micro business that each prisoner who desires
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.380]   is given a plot of land that is his to manage,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.580]   is helped with the initial seeds and gardening supplies
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.860]   and instructions for how to grow things.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.660]   And then he has complete and full supervision
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.220]   over that part of the land,
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.100]   and he's entitled to the produce that comes from that land.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.860]   Now, on the whole, this effort
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.940]   has been enormously successful,
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.060]   much more successful than ever dreamed of.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.500]   It's not been perfect.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.660]   One of the frustrating things is that in many cases,
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.900]   the guys are so hungry
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.060]   that they don't even let their crops grow.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.900]   You'll have a little lettuce out there
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.540]   and tiny little pieces of lettuce,
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.060]   it's all being eaten before it grows,
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.220]   the tomatoes are eaten green.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.220]   But we've made progress and little by little,
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.700]   it's been very, very productive.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.460]   But the good thing about it is this has taken
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.700]   basically vacant unused land and turned it productive.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.820]   And more importantly, it has provided a great,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.540]   again, a good source of calories
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.620]   and a great source of work and organization
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.980]   for many of the prisoners.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.260]   And so over the last years,
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.500]   this work has grown and grown and grown.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.060]   And we've developed a team of pastors
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.300]   who have been involved with facilitating that.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.260]   And these two things have gone hand in hand,
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.100]   of again, planting small churches
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.140]   and not small in some cases,
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.420]   but basically trying to facilitate prison fellowships
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.780]   inside of the prisons, as well as facilitating gardens
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.380]   and expanding the gardening program.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.100]   And the success of the program has given a lot of access
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.140]   and a lot of success.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.380]   It has won many friends in high places
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.060]   and won quite a lot of respect of many people.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.580]   And so that's been a really rewarding
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.820]   and productive use of time and energy
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.500]   to really try to solve some significant problems.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.340]   From a financial perspective,
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.180]   I'm pretty proud of the results.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.060]   I don't claim any credit for them at all.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.460]   I'm just proud of the results
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.620]   because I'm pretty skeptical of a lot of charitable work.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.940]   Much of it seems to be an enormous waste of money.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.820]   You get a huge budgets and whatnot for very few results.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.460]   So I'm skeptical of most charitable relief work.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.220]   And thank God this work has been very productive
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.900]   and it's all been done on an absolute shoestring.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.540]   The results from a financial perspective
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.780]   of what we could put into a fundraising video
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.660]   and whatnot for a big organization would be amazing.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.260]   It's been really, really good.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.780]   I'm very, very pleased with the work.
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.380]   And it's been a really good return on investment.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.780]   It hasn't needed a lot of capital though.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.700]   And so I haven't, this is why I haven't been years
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.940]   since I've talked about any of these issues here publicly.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.100]   I haven't done any fundraising for this.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.540]   I've been supporting it.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.580]   There's been others that have supported it privately.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.700]   And we've supported both the purchase of supplies
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.580]   for the physical relief work
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.820]   as well as the Christian ministers
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.020]   and their work as well.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.540]   You get quite a lot of return on your money
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.540]   for the labor of very faithful, hardworking men
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.020]   who really care about the people
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.380]   that they're ministering to.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.180]   It's been really, really great.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.260]   However, the opportunities have just gotten bigger
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.100]   and bigger.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.860]   And so now we are trying to be faithful
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.860]   and expand to a larger level.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.340]   So the opportunities for expansion though
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.900]   mean that now what we can do with the money
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.820]   or what we can do with if we had more money is worth doing.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.620]   And yet the opportunity has exceeded what I can do
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.620]   and what the other people who are directly involved can do.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.580]   So I'm coming to you
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.900]   and I would like to invite you to be involved in it.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.780]   Specifically, what I need is I need donations.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.540]   And what I would do with those donations
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.580]   is I will use the donations
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.340]   to purchase agricultural supplies.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.340]   So what we do is purchase all of the supplies
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.060]   in Bogota, Colombia, where they're widely available,
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.260]   seeds, gardening supplies, tools,
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.460]   all of the things that are not available in Venezuela.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.900]   And then we bring them in to Venezuela
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.260]   and we distribute them, make small package starter,
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.020]   starter packages that we hand out to the prisoners
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.380]   and teach them and give them classes on what to do.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.580]   And then they can go ahead
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.140]   and start running their own gardens
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.100]   and they get the crops.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.980]   And again, they can make the money off of it,
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.180]   they can sell the produce, they can feed themselves,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.140]   they can feed others, that's the plan.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.500]   And so that's what I need your money for
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.620]   is your donations is to buy that.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.820]   I continue to be involved on the Christian side of things.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.940]   I'm not scared to come to you
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.500]   and ask for you to donate to Christian work,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.100]   but that's not my specific,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.580]   just doesn't seem like that's something
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.980]   that I want to do at this point in time.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.260]   Specifically, I'm not asking you to support missionaries.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.220]   This is a specific, a charitable relief effort,
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.900]   and I need money to purchase seeds
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.540]   and take it into Venezuela and deal with all of that.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.020]   There are a few wrinkles to this as to why,
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.660]   first of all, you'll notice that I'm thinking carefully
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.860]   and choosing my words carefully.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.740]   Due to all of the political instability,
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.140]   due to all of the details,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.460]   due to all of the people who were involved,
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.860]   and due to the past history of relief
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.540]   and various laws that have been passed
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.260]   and laws that change and things like that,
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.900]   I'm trying to be very circumspect in my words
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.740]   so as not to unnecessarily involve someone
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.580]   who doesn't need to be unnecessarily involved.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.740]   Because of the sensitive political situation,
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.620]   it's better that a lot of this be relatively private.
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.620]   And the support that we've been able to receive
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.540]   from a government perspective
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.860]   is not something that anyone wishes to jeopardize
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.580]   because that support is very necessary
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.140]   to the well-being of the men who are imprisoned.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.740]   And so I wanna be thoughtful and respectful with my words
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.940]   and only share what's necessary to you.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.420]   The problem is that that means that, basically,
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.580]   if you're gonna donate, you have to trust me.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.740]   And I can't provide, and I'm not going to provide,
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.740]   any more due diligence or anything else than this.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.140]   You say, "Joshua, why don't you go
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.420]   "and actually start a large charity
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.980]   "or an official organization and things like that?
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.980]   "Why don't you go and do it?"
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.780]   Quite literally, it would be illegal for me to do it.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.460]   When you send me money, I'm gonna take that money.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.660]   I'm gonna get stacks of cash out of an ATM.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.940]   I'm gonna hand that money, the stacks of cash,
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.020]   to people who are going to go to the market in Bogota
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.420]   and buy large supplies,
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.180]   and then we're gonna ship them off to Venezuela.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.580]   And so all of this work is all being done
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.520]   with basically no paper trail.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.940]   Even if we wanted to provide a paper trail, we couldn't.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.460]   The whole concept, one of the things,
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.220]   I haven't done much on the stuff in Venezuela,
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.860]   but it's fascinating, with a lot of day-to-day businesses,
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.340]   the whole concept of accounting and bookkeeping,
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.180]   with the old currency that just,
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.140]   people going around with stacks and stacks and stacks
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.480]   of taped-up bolivares, bolivars,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.460]   is just completely,
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:20.300]   the whole concept of bookkeeping and accounting
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.020]   disappeared from many places.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.500]   Not with big businesses, of course,
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.400]   who would keep their accounting in dollars
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.960]   and other stable currencies,
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.060]   but on a local level, it's like,
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.620]   the population has forgotten how to do bookkeeping
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.200]   and paper trails and receipts and all of that.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.420]   So I can't, I actually can't,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.820]   I can't do the necessary legal due diligences
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.420]   that would be involved of starting an organization.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.840]   And then there's so many,
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.800]   basically, the whole thing is operating on trust.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.900]   I know the people that are involved, I trust them,
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.360]   I've been involved in sending money
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.740]   and being involved continually over time,
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.100]   and I will continue to be involved.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.180]   I, myself, will be in Venezuela,
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.100]   touring at a separate event within a few weeks,
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.180]   and so I'll be delivering the work myself
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.180]   and be there physically myself in the coming weeks.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.100]   And so I'm not gonna use any of the money
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.620]   for anything except providing for them,
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.360]   but I can't provide any more,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.740]   I can't provide any more paper trail
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.020]   or anything like that than you.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.980]   So basically, I'm coming to you, I'm saying,
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.980]   if you trust me, if you respect me,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.060]   then send me some money and I give you my word of honor
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.600]   that I will use it for the purposes that I'm describing.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.060]   And I'm hoping that in the future
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.940]   that we could expand and do more.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.180]   The opportunity right now,
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.740]   this big expansion is a really exciting opportunity.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.760]   There's no way, there's no way that I could organize,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.560]   so I really wanna do more work
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.600]   here at Radical Personal Finance to connect us together.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.680]   There's zero possibility at the moment
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.320]   of doing anything in Venezuela
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.680]   because of visa restrictions and things like that.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.720]   It's just, it's the security situation is very poor.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.360]   It's a very unsafe place to travel
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.440]   without special protection
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.260]   and without special dispensation
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.500]   from the government authorities.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.340]   And so I can't do it,
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.260]   I can't involve anybody at this point in time in Venezuela.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.060]   I have thought and looked and thought,
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.180]   okay, well, maybe we would do something in Colombia.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.740]   Maybe we would, I could organize some kind of event
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.700]   and provide more publicity and public figure
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.900]   and invite the Radical Personal Finance family
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.940]   to do something in Colombia on the border.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.360]   But I don't see any opportunity for that
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.620]   at this point in time.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.000]   So that's what it is.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.760]   And so basically, I care a lot about charity
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.360]   and I don't know a lot about it.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.920]   I find it easier to find problems
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.620]   with things that are done poorly
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.200]   than to actually suggest solutions
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.360]   of things that are being done well.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.600]   And I don't wanna be the guy,
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.480]   I hate being the guy who comes out here
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.520]   and just pokes problem, problem, problem, problem
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.560]   at good, intelligent, good-hearted people
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.880]   who are trying to solve problems.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.800]   Just because things are inefficient,
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.480]   just because things are difficult
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   doesn't mean that we should come out
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.200]   and find problems with them.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.960]   They're trying.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.160]   But I also think that we need
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.520]   to be really working hard on this
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.140]   because the world of charity and relief
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.700]   is so fraught with bloat and ineffectiveness
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.220]   and difficulty and things like that.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.460]   And so I'm just trying to prove out for myself
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.700]   are there some ideas and principles
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.960]   that could be gained from this?
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.580]   And maybe at some point in the future
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.860]   I can share some of those things.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.300]   But at the moment, this particular work
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.620]   has been very effective.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.100]   It's been very blessed and I need money.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.860]   So I'm coming to you to ask for it.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.740]   If you have some money that's available
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.540]   in your giving budget and you would like
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.340]   to give it to me for me to pass along
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.420]   to the people and to purchase the things
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.200]   that are gonna need to be done,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.060]   then that's what it can be used for.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.900]   Specifically, I will take your money,
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.500]   I will use it to purchase agricultural supplies
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.420]   which will be planting many acres of gardens.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.060]   Right now we're targeting to plant about 120 new acres
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.940]   across more than a dozen prisons across Venezuela.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.860]   We've got quite a lot of stuff prepared for it.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.340]   And if we can raise enough money,
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.300]   then we can continue to see this program multiply
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.700]   and grow significantly.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.700]   And it's been a real tool to provide some very needed relief
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:57.420]   for men who are hungry and need food
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.500]   and for men who are idle and need work.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.120]   So if you trust me and you would like to be involved
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.020]   and help partner with me in that work,
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.940]   then I would ask you to go to the link
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.520]   in the show notes or the description
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.360]   for today's podcast episode.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.980]   Again, you can use a credit card to donate
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.660]   using a Stripe page that I've set up
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.180]   or you can send me money on PayPal.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.620]   Both of those are fine.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.580]   I can't collect any physical donations at the moment.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.000]   I need electronic money.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.200]   I can't give you any kind of tax deduction.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.500]   You won't receive any tax deduction for your contributions
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.340]   because as I said,
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.080]   there's no tax deductible organization.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.000]   I have arranged it in the past.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.400]   If you are going to give a significant amount of money,
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.200]   in the previous fundraising effort,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.840]   we had a donor who donated a five-figure sum,
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.100]   which we were able to pass through
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.900]   an appropriate tax-exempt organization.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.380]   So if you would like to donate a five-figure sum,
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.660]   then contact me.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.820]   You can email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.540]   and I can use an appropriate tax-exempt entity
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.580]   to provide stewardship for those specific funds.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.260]   And those specific funds, what we did in the past
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.180]   was I used the money to buy a vehicle.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.900]   And so we were able to have a proper paper trail
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.900]   following all the laws for organized charities.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.940]   And so we were able to do it as was necessary.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.660]   So if you would like to donate five figures to me,
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.100]   then reach out to me before you do that,
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.540]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.060]   But I don't need very many five-figure donations.
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.920]   I'd rather just have more modest
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.500]   three and four-figure donations using the link.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.260]   And I'll take the money, I'll pass it along,
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.620]   and use it to purchase the supplies and be the steward of it.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.160]   I will give reports on that as well in the future.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.820]   You'll see as things happen.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.140]   And I'll try to, one of the best things is,
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.540]   I feel more comfortable sharing
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.900]   about a lot of this stuff personally.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.380]   So like we did at Radical Personal Finance Family Camp,
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.020]   if you come to a family camp,
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.140]   and I'll show you pictures of what we've done in Venezuela,
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.300]   things like that.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.420]   So also pray for me.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.760]   Like I said, I'll be there personally for a conference
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.300]   and touring some of the prisons here in a few weeks.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.680]   And so it's difficult when you're a father of five,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.420]   it's difficult to go to a place like Venezuela
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.700]   and feel like you're making the right decision.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.220]   But it's something that I believe is important.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.700]   And so I would ask for your prayers as well.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.700]   Thank you very much.
