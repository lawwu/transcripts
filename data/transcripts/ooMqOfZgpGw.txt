[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780]   I don't think it's a coincidence that FTX and Theranos were not
[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.760]   publicly traded companies, right?
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.320]   But there's a certain sort of black box quality to these companies because people
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.160]   aren't shorting them and aren't, you know, whispering to journalists about that, that
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.480]   there's something wrong here and there aren't publicly available financials for
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.720]   people to dig through and look, look and look at the numbers.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.900]   So now I don't think that's a coincidence.
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.420]   And I do think this gigantic moves into private assets has been probably not
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.020]   great for that, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the safety of the system.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.820]   And you'd say, well, it's just institutional investors who can
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.740]   afford to lose money, who aren't losing money, but it's really not because
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.020]   institutional investors are just pentant fund money and is now mutual fund money.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.580]   So that distinction that the people who are investing in this stuff can
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.100]   afford to lose it is not really true.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.260]   Um, so I don't, I don't like that rationalization.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.660]   I think we're going to see how that plays out.
