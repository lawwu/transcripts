[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   [Silence]
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.600]   Discovery of lithium as a treatment for bipolar disorder
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.400]   is truly a miraculous story
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.980]   that I think everyone should know.
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.840]   The key player in this story is a physician
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   by the last name Cade.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.320]   He was an Australian physician
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.640]   and Cade has a very interesting story in his own right.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.520]   Cade was an Australian psychiatrist
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.240]   or Australian psychiatrist who also was a soldier.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.720]   And during World War II,
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.560]   after the fall of Singapore to Japan,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.760]   he became a prisoner of war
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.000]   and he was a prisoner of war from 1942 until 1945.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240]   So he had some time for observation
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.920]   and during his imprisonment,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.160]   he observed some of his fellow inmates
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.020]   as going through pretty wild vacillations
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.680]   in mood and energy,
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.960]   essentially going from manic episodes to depressed episodes
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.240]   or from manic to normal episodes.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.320]   And for one reason or another,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.240]   we don't know why,
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.520]   because I couldn't find any report
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   as to why he hypothesized this,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.060]   but he hypothesized that there was some buildup
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.840]   of some chemical in these people's brains
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.440]   that then they would urinate out
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.960]   and that urinating out of whatever chemical was in there
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.040]   would allow them to be more relaxed and not manic.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.320]   In other words, Cade hypothesized
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   that there's a buildup of a chemical
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   in certain people's brains that makes them manic
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.080]   and they urinate that chemical out.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.560]   So eventually he got out of this prison,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.500]   as we mentioned, in 1945,
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.400]   and he started doing experiments
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.320]   in addition to seeing patients in his clinic.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.520]   And what he did is he started to take urine
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.000]   from people who exhibited mania
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.440]   and urine from people who were not manic.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.920]   And he took that urine and he would inject it
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.880]   into guinea pigs as an experimental model.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.440]   And his general observation
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.920]   was that there was something in the urine
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.600]   that was indeed making the guinea pigs more manic
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.120]   if they were injected with urine from a manic patient.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.840]   The exact measures that he was taking
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.720]   in these guinea pigs wasn't exactly clear.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.620]   This is at a time or an era in science
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.700]   when you could just sort of report things
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.160]   a little bit more subjectively,
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.680]   although there were still numbers and statistics.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.000]   It was a little bit more of like case studies
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.040]   and descriptions.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.400]   But it turns out that even though
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.720]   that all seems a little bit loose,
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.380]   it led to some incredible and still important discoveries
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.120]   for psychiatric health.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.640]   So what he figured out was that the urine
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.720]   from manic patients seemed to be more toxic
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.280]   for these guinea pigs.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.860]   And he also knew that there are two toxic substances
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.240]   in urine, urea and uric acid.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.600]   So he was able to separate the urea and uric acid
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.040]   from people with mania and patients that did not have mania.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.240]   And he figured out that the urea was the same
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.280]   in both these mentally ill manic patients
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.080]   and the non-manic patients.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.640]   So it did not seem that urea was the compound
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120]   that was creating these manic episodes
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.280]   or related to manic episodes or held the toxicity.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.240]   So instead he focused on the uric acid.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.960]   Now, in order to put the uric acid into solution
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.240]   so that he could inject it into these guinea pigs,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.360]   he had to try a number of different compounds
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.280]   in order to dilute it.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   It just so happens that,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.660]   and you chemists will be familiar with this,
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.000]   but there's certain things
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.640]   that just don't go into solution easily.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.600]   You put the powder in a vial,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.880]   you add some water or a saline or another solution,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.240]   you mix it up and the powder stays suspended in there.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.040]   It just doesn't actually ever become a clear liquid
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.400]   that you can inject.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.360]   So in order to try injecting different strengths
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.980]   of uric acid, he ended up using lithium
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.200]   to assist in the dilution and lithium worked.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.560]   So what he basically was doing, again, for you chemists,
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.000]   is he was taking uric acid, he was adding lithium
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.200]   and making a solution of lithium urate, okay?
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.880]   This is a lot of details, but this is important
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.960]   because what he eventually found
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   is that when he diluted the uric acid with lithium
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.320]   and created lithium urate,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.600]   lithium urate could actually calm down these guinea pigs
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.840]   that were injected with the toxic urea.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.600]   He also found that lithium urate
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.320]   had a generally calming effect on these guinea pigs.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.000]   So now we're really off in crazy territory, right?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.160]   We're talking about urine from patients
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.360]   that's separating out urea and uric acid.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.480]   We're adding lithium to the uric acid.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.080]   We're injecting this into guinea pigs.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.200]   This is getting pretty wild and pretty weird,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.800]   but this is medicine and from time to time,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.440]   this is medicine and science.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.320]   Cade was a good scientist
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.340]   in addition to being a good physician.
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.980]   And by good scientist,
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.900]   I mean that he did control experiments.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.820]   Here he was injecting lithium urate into animals
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.060]   and seeing an effect,
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.140]   but he knew that that solution of lithium urate
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.940]   contained not just the uric acid,
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.500]   but it also contained lithium.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.460]   And so he quite appropriately asked,
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.540]   maybe the lithium alone is having this calming effect
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.020]   on these guinea pigs.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.700]   And indeed that was the case.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.660]   When he did the proper control experiment
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.660]   and injected only lithium solution into these guinea pigs,
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.940]   they calm down.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.500]   From there, he in sort of 1940 style medicine,
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.260]   this would not happen now.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.460]   He very quickly moved from that animal model
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.020]   into human patients
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.060]   and started injecting human patients with lithium
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.100]   or providing lithium orally to those patients.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.740]   And lo and behold,
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.180]   found an absolutely profound and positive effect
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.820]   of lithium in reducing symptoms of mania.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.460]   And as all good physician scientists do,
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.140]   he wrote up his results
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.380]   and he wrote it up in a paper entitled
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.820]   "Lithium Salt and the Treatment of Psychotic Excitement."
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.060]   Okay, back then they didn't call it mania,
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.320]   they called it psychotic excitement.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.160]   This is a paper that was published September 3rd, 1949
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.080]   in the Medical Journal of Australia.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.620]   We will provide a link to this study
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.960]   is now a classic study in the field of psychiatry.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.700]   It's a really wonderful paper to read
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.700]   and actually I encourage people,
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.140]   even if you're not a scientist or a clinician,
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.060]   to just take a quick look at the second page in this paper
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.220]   that we've made available to you,
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.860]   where he describes each of the various case studies
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.020]   or the individuals that he looked at.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.620]   I'm not going to read these in detail now
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.560]   'cause it would take a lot of unnecessary time,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.980]   but things like case seven,
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.100]   MC aged 40 years old,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.060]   suffering from manic recurrent mania.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.260]   In this episode, he'd been excited,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.380]   restless and violent for over two months
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.420]   and was interfering so often
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.780]   that he had to be confined to a single room during the day.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.240]   Right, so this is very debilitating,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.340]   what we now know to be bipolar depression.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.780]   He commenced taking lithium citrate 20 grains,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.820]   that's a measure of the amount of lithium,
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.640]   three times a day.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.180]   In four days, he was distinctly quieter
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.900]   and by February 13th, 1949 appeared practically normal.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.380]   He continued well and on February 20th, 1949,
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.540]   the dose of citrate was reduced to 10 grains,
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.380]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.820]   He left the hospital.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.740]   There are numerous descriptions
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.220]   of this sort within this paper,
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.780]   including some descriptions of patients
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.300]   that did not see such success
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.680]   and including some descriptions of patients
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.660]   that suffered from some negative side effects.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.460]   So that's important to point out as well,
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.720]   but it's an absolutely wonderful paper
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.160]   and it's an absolutely wonderful voyage
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.740]   into the history of psychiatry,
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.020]   right down to the discussion
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.760]   where in just three short paragraphs,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.700]   Cade really lays out the case for why lithium
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.420]   is such an important discovery
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.420]   in the treatment of what at that time
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.940]   they were calling psychotic excitement
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.640]   and what we now know to be manic bipolar depression.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.220]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.620]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.680]   you
