[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   I was running a magazine by day, but I still nerd by night.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.520]   My first nerd thing was the long tail and the statistical analysis.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.480]   Writing books, they were largely economic books because I'm not trained in economics.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.840]   My time at The Economist sort of osmotically gave me some exposure.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.640]   But still, basically, I'm a programmer by heart.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.280]   As my kids got older, I've got five kids and they were ... My wife's a scientist as well
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.040]   and we try to get them interested in science and technology.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.720]   As they got older, I was thinking of cool things to do with them.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.840]   I actually started a site called Geek Dad.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.840]   Are you starting Geek Dad?
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840]   I know Geek Dad, that's awesome.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.760]   Although I think Geek Mom is actually doing even better right now.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.760]   Nice.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   Also a spin off of this.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.320]   But so I started Geek Dad and it was largely the notion was STEM projects that were sort
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.640]   of fun for the kid and fun for the adult.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.760]   Because there was a lot of things that were fun for the adult, not fun for the kid or
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.240]   fun for the kid and not fun for the adult.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.920]   But the ones that kind of got it exactly right.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.280]   And so in the course of doing that, I was like, "Robots.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.120]   We should probably do something with robots."
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.480]   And the kids are like ... So Lego, I was on their advisory board and Lego sent me the
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480]   first Lego Mindstorms.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.480]   Whoa, you, man, wow.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480]   That's awesome.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.480]   It was pretty cool.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.560]   So they sent me the first Lego Mindstorms like beta testing.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.540]   And so I showed it to the kids and the kids are like, "Yeah, we'll do it."
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.880]   And so you follow the instruction you put together and it takes all morning and then
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.320]   you have a little sort of wheeled robot that'll kind of move towards a wall and then back
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.320]   away.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320]   And the kids are like, "You're kidding me."
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.320]   No, sorry.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.680]   They definitely believe that.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.960]   They do not use that kind of language.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.080]   But internally, whatever the sort of nine-year-old equivalent of that is.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.120]   And I realized that Hollywood has ruined robotics for kids because you've got transformers and
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.120]   this incredible stuff.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.340]   And meanwhile, real robots, at least most of them, don't really do anything.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.020]   We're talking about Roomba, et cetera.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.260]   So the gap between this sort of Hollywood version of robots and the prosaic reality
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.220]   was such that it was really hard to get them excited.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.740]   So I thought, "Well, what would be cooler than a rolling robot?"
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.980]   I thought, "A flying robot."
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.340]   And so I'm like, "Well, I don't actually know what a flying robot is.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.060]   I just ... Astro boy or something, I'm not sure."
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.980]   So I literally Googled flying robot and the first result was drone.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.980]   I was like, "Huh.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.560]   I had thought about, I guess a drone is a flying robot.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   Wait, what's a drone?"
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800]   So I Googled drone and a drone is like a-
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   Wait, what year is this?
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   This is like a hard to imagine.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   This is '96, '97.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   Sorry, 2006, 2007.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Okay, wow.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   So drones are not in the zeitgeist yet.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   No.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.980]   No, well, drones were in the zeitgeist as a military thing.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.980]   I see.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.980]   Right.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.980]   But there were no consumer drones.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.980]   You couldn't buy one.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.980]   I know.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.980]   I know.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.980]   It seems so crazy now.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.900]   But it's like drones were like a predator that shot hellfire missiles, et cetera.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.820]   It was really a purely military thing.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.820]   Right.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.220]   So I Googled, it's like, "What's a drone?"
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.660]   And drone's like basically a plane with a brain.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660]   It had an autopilot.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.660]   And I'm like, "Okay.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.820]   Wait, what's an autopilot?"
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.980]   And you Google the autopilot and it's like basically sensors and compute and it's kind
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.620]   of figures out which way is down, which way is up, GPS, et cetera.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.500]   And I was like, "Those sensors and that compute, that's kind of what we have here in the Lego
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.780]   Mindstorms box," which came with accelerometer and magnetometer and gyro, et cetera.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.860]   And I was like, "Let's just do it."
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.740]   And so around the dining room table, we built an autopilot out of Lego, stuck it in a radio
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.780]   controlled airplane and it kind of almost worked.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.660]   And the kids thought that was mildly amusing for about a minute and I was blown away.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.940]   I was like, "What just happened?
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.780]   Did we really just build a drone with children on the dining room table out of Lego and it
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.780]   worked?"
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.780]   Wait, can I ask you a very...
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.300]   Just having messed around with drones quite a bit, I feel like you're skipping over the
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.060]   part where the thing keeps crashing and breaking and then you spend an hour putting it back
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.540]   together and it crashes and breaks again.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.940]   It's maddening, right?
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.940]   Oh no.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.940]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.940]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.460]   So I just told you the bit that got me excited, that put the idea in my brain.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.100]   The next five years were just horrible.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.100]   But I couldn't let it...
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:28.060]   So basically what had happened in 2007 was a bunch of things that in retrospect seem
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.500]   obvious, but with 2007, it was beginning of the maker movement.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.620]   So it was 3D printing, it was Arduino came out, but what it really was, was the launch
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.860]   of the iPhone, 2007.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.340]   So what's in an iPhone?
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.500]   A bunch of things, but including our MEMS sensors, these sensors that were chips and
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.940]   previous sensors were mechanical.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.620]   A gyro was literally a mechanical gyroscope and it was just unaffordable, unattainable.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.000]   And so I call this the peace dividend of the smartphone wars.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.380]   But basically the components of an iPhone had now been so cheap and available that you
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.780]   could then put them together in different ways and explore adjacent space.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.780]   So like a Fitbit.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.900]   Well, the Wii controller, for example, was an accelerometer, a MEMS accelerometer.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.180]   The Fitbit guys got a Wii controller and just like I got like a mindstorm and said, "Huh,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.180]   what else could I do?"
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.540]   They got a Wii controller, opened it up, saw the accelerometer and thought, "What else
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.540]   can we do?"
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.220]   And they came up with Fitbit.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.880]   And so there's a bunch of people who were sort of looking at the components that came
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.140]   out of smartphones and thinking, "How do I recombine them to create something new and
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.140]   transform an industry?"
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.140]   And so that's what we did.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.140]   And so basically rather than drones, which had been aerospace grade stuff, so you basically
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.980]   could take an airplane and subtract the pilot, we're like, "Take a smartphone and add wings."
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.780]   And that bottoms up approach was completely radical and transformative and was, initially
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.780]   was horrible.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.780]   I mean, nothing worked.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.380]   They crashed all the time, but because they were small and foam and cheap, nobody got
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.380]   hurt.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.380]   Right.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.860]   And because they were small and foam and cheap, we could actually build a community and we
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.620]   got tens of thousands of people contributing and beta testing for all the right reasons.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:20.540]   And we collectively as a community innovated super fast so that we went from Lego to foam
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:27.540]   to plastic to basically dominating the drone world, including becoming the biggest drone
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.940]   producer in North America five years after that with no funding.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.500]   That all just happened and it just kind of exploded out of nowhere.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.680]   It's kind of like the way the internet kind of took over the telecom sector or PCs took
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.020]   over compute.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.940]   This is a bunch of amateurs with open source software and hacked together stuff basically
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.780]   took over the future of aerospace.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.020]   It was classic Gandhi stuff.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.460]   First they ignored, then they laughed, then they fought, then they lost.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.300]   And today it's pretty evident that the future of aerospace looks unmanned, it looks electric,
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.540]   it looks more like Silicon Valley than it does like Boeing or Airbus.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:14.960]   Just like SpaceX did to the launch alliance, the tech, the Silicon Valley drone model seems
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:31.200]   to be the future of aviation.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.900]   Thank you.
