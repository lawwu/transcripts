[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   All right, our first question comes from H, who asks,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.200]   "How do I get over fear of starting a business?
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.680]   I've always wanted to be entrepreneurial to maximize autonomy over my life and alignment
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.640]   of what I do in my career with my values, but I have a lack of confidence in my personal skills
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.520]   or any domain expertise. And more than that, I'm very, very scared of the risk of entrepreneurism.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.280]   Do you have any advice?" Well, H, the right advice for you, I think, can be found in my book,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You." And in that book, I introduced the idea, which we've talked about
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.240]   on the show before, of money acting as a neutral indicator of value. It's a term that I borrowed
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:01.280]   from the entrepreneur, Derek Sivers. Now, the concept here is the way you de-risk a change
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.920]   in your career, especially a change, let's say, from a steady paycheck job to an entrepreneurial
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.360]   vision, is that you look to see if you can make money on the new thing. You don't ask people,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.120]   "Is this a good idea?" You don't ask people, "Do you think I should go out on my own and start
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.920]   this business?" You don't just look to your gut and say, "What's my passion or what do I feel
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.760]   like doing?" You instead, on the side, start doing to a reduced degree the thing you're considering
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.080]   and see if people will give you money. Because here's the thing, it costs me nothing to tell
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   you something's a good idea. It costs me nothing to compliment you. It costs me nothing to get you
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.480]   fired up about going big and betting on yourself. That costs me nothing. And I'll just do that. Why
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.600]   not? I'm a nice guy. I don't want to be mean to you, but you want my money. That's different.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.680]   People are different about that. They're not going to give you their money unless they actually
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.600]   value what they're getting. And so Derek Sivers says, "Use money as a neutral indicator value."
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.680]   It's a way of evaluating, "Is this business idea good? Can I get clients? Will they pay me?
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.240]   Can I sell these things?" Derek Sivers used this before he left his job as an A&R executive to
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.000]   become a full-time musician. "Can I make enough money off gigs on the side to replace my salary?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.520]   Then I will quit the A&R job." And when he left his job as a musician to start
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.800]   a online music company, CD Baby, he ran it on the side until he was making enough money to
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.360]   support him. And then he quit touring to work on the company. So if you're really, really worried,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.000]   let that worry be your motivation to use this strategy. Get a specific idea. Run it on the side.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.960]   See if you can make money. And if you're making enough money to live off of,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.360]   then you won't have the fear. Or at least your fear will be greatly diminished.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.880]   And if you're not making enough money to live on, that's a great signal. That means
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.200]   don't go quit your job. Don't go try to do this new thing. There be dragons.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.000]   I'm surprised how often people skip this step because they don't want the answer.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.760]   They love the romance of doing something different. They love the romance of what life would be like
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.920]   if they didn't have a boss. But they don't want to confront the reality that their idea might not be
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.960]   that good, that people might not actually pay them, they might not actually make a living.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.600]   So they avoid this step because they don't want an obstacle to the thing that they want to be true.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.680]   And I think it's a very dangerous way to go about career shifts. So H, try what you want to do. See
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.040]   if you get paid for it. If you don't, try something else. If you do, your fear should be pretty
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.640]   diminished.
