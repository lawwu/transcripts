[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   The first cashback card is the Blue Cash Everyday card.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.140]   It's a zero annual fee card.
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.780]   It earns 3% back on groceries,
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.180]   3% back on online retail, and 3% back on gas.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.660]   Each of those individual categories
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.920]   is only on the first $6,000 a year.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.000]   And then after that, it is a 1% card.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.520]   The signup bonus right now is $200
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.500]   on 2,000 spend in six months.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.100]   There's a 0% intro APR for 12 months.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.340]   That signup bonus hasn't been higher since 2022.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.660]   And there aren't a lot of perks on this card.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.720]   $7 a month towards your Disney bundle.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   And it also has a 2.7% foreign transaction fee.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.320]   Given that there are cards out there
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.960]   that like the Robinhood card that are 3% on everything,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.400]   and there are plenty of cards that are going to reward you
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.280]   3X points or 3% back or more on groceries and gas.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.500]   And the online retail category is only up to $6,000 a year.
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.100]   So are the others.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.320]   This card is not that exciting to me.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.900]   Yes, it's a no annual fee card,
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.140]   but you're not getting access to membership rewards.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.600]   You're not earning that much.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.980]   This card for me, I'm going to put in the C tier.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.240]   It's just not something that I'm going to be excited
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.940]   to be using on any regular basis.
