[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   Any other thoughts on oral hygiene, dental care for kids?
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.740]   Chew gum, keep throwing gum at them.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.080]   Find a healthy gum.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.680]   That is the best thing you can do.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.100]   There are plenty of studies out there.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.400]   In fact, if mom, a pregnant mom chews gum
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.820]   and when the baby is born, her child will have,
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.280]   I think it's 64% less chance of having a cavity by age six.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.820]   If the kid is chewing gum, I think it's like a 93%.
