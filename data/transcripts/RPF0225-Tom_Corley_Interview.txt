[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Today on the show I share with you an interview with Tom Corley.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.720]   Tom is an accomplished accountant who is also a financial planner by trade.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.780]   He became interested in the subject of wealth and performed a survey of his wealthy clients
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.480]   trying to elucidate what made them different from other people.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.300]   Completed a survey of a number of wealthy people and also a number of poor people and
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.680]   from those surveys and from that research extracted some habits and some principles
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.640]   that were common to all of the wealthy people and were uncommon to the poor people.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.240]   He went on to write a book called Rich Habits, the Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.820]   Find out how the rich get so rich, the secrets to financial success revealed.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.720]   He followed that up with an additional book called Rich Kids, How to Raise Our Children
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.100]   to be Happy and Successful in Life.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:17.240]   Kind of an important subject, don't you think?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.120]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.920]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host, your guide and your fellow adventurer on the
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.420]   journey to financial independence.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.360]   This is the show where we talk each and every day about all of the concepts and all of the
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.340]   content and all of the information required to construct a rich and successful life, day
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.320]   by day, working hard, doing all we can do to build and grow toward financial independence.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.840]   I'm very much looking forward to hearing your feedback after this interview.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.040]   I was thrilled to do it.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.480]   It's one of the more enjoyable interviews that I have done with an author and it's enjoyable
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.480]   for a number of reasons.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.640]   Number one, the content matter of this interview is a perfect fit for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.520]   After all, this is exactly what we talk about.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.760]   It's also in many ways a confirmation of many of the ideas that I've held for a long time
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.560]   and it's always exciting to see some of the ideas that you hold near and dear to your
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.960]   heart confirmed in the marketplace.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.480]   Most importantly, I want you to pay attention to the story.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.280]   During the course of this interview, I did not focus heavily on the content of Tom's
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   books.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.800]   I personally have found that authors are very challenging people to interview and one of
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.960]   the changes that I've made with my interviewing style, you can tell me if you like it or not,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.920]   is not so much to focus on trying to get an author to go step by step through their book.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.760]   That's a mistake that I made in earlier episodes of Radical Personal Finance and it doesn't,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.440]   in my opinion, doesn't work well because they wrote a book for a reason.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.200]   If you want to know what the rich habits are, read the book and obviously a good quick summary
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.600]   is very useful.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.480]   But more than that, I was interested in Tom's story.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.800]   So listen for that through the course of this interview.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.160]   Listen for Tom's story and how he personally changed and the steps that he took because
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.480]   there's nothing that Tom has done that you or I can't do as well.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.000]   Tom welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.320]   I've been looking forward to speaking with you.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.160]   Tom Gjelten: Thanks for having me on your show Joshua.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.720]   It's really an honor to be there.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.080]   Tom Bilyeu: I've been wanting to talk with you because you have written extensively about
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.720]   success habits which is going to be the core of our show but you've also built a career
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.760]   in financial services.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.880]   And so as a fellow financial planner, I've been looking forward to talking to you about
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.240]   the intersection of these things.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.880]   Before we get into the meat and potatoes, I'd love it if you'd share a little bit about
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.380]   your background and your journey through the financial planning industry and the accounting
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.920]   industry and how that ultimately led to your creating the Rich Habits books.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920]   Tom Gjelten: Sure.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.200]   Well, I'm a CPA and I'm also a certified financial planner.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.300]   I also have a master's in tax and I mention that only because I spent a great deal of
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:21.520]   my career focused on large corporate tax and complicated individual tax areas like expatriates
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.200]   and things like that.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:32.440]   What happened was the transition into what I'm doing here was really just by happenstance.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:41.800]   I took over the reins of this CPA firm, Seraphus & Company in 2003 and sometime in the middle
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:50.480]   of 2004, one of our clients who was a business owner was struggling financially.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.720]   They needed to have a meeting with me immediately.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.160]   Their bank had shut down their line of credit and they couldn't make payroll and so they
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   were basically coming to me looking for a Hail Mary pass with a couple of seconds on
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.880]   the clock and I told them I couldn't find a bank that quickly.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.280]   Those things take time, building banking relationships.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.360]   The guy just broke down and started crying.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.440]   It was a family business he had inherited from his dad and because of, as I found out,
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.760]   because of certain bad habits that he had, he was basically taking all the cash flow
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.640]   out of the business.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.600]   He started crying and he asked me what was he doing wrong, what are my successful clients
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.760]   doing.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.280]   It affected me emotionally and so I started doing some initial research.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.120]   I found some okay information, mainly it was the millionaire next door research, but it
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.920]   didn't really tell me what the guy was doing wrong and there wasn't a lot of information
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.760]   in there that was helpful, I thought.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.120]   I started doing the research then.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.400]   It took me about six months to develop what became my 20 question list, which is really
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:22.840]   154 questions, but I broke it down into 20 categories.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.640]   It took four years of interviewing.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.760]   Initially I started out interviewing wealthy people and I stopped at 233.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.280]   Don't ask me why, I just stopped.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.040]   I thought I had enough.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.000]   I didn't want to go above really 150, but I was just drawn into this.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.680]   It was so compelling, the information I was gathering.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.920]   Then I said, "Well, I know what wealthy people are doing, but what are poor people doing
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.380]   that are holding them back?"
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.140]   My goal was to just interview 100 poor people.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.780]   My goal was actually 150 poor people, but I struggled, believe it or not, finding poor
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.680]   people to interview.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.800]   I only got 128, but I thought it was relevant enough sampling for me.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.520]   I wasn't doing this for Princeton.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.280]   I was doing it to try and answer a question that I had, which is why are people rich and
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.360]   why are people poor?
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.160]   I took all of this information that I gathered through this 20 question list and I dumped
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   it onto a bunch of Excel worksheets and I started categorizing it.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.680]   It took about 18 months.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:50.360]   Now I've got over 300 data points that I've tracked from my research that really tell
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.960]   the story, tell us a whole story about why you're rich and why you're poor.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.720]   I started doing these learning sessions.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.360]   I have a conference room here in my office and you could fit about 10 to 12 people in
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   it at night.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.440]   I had about a dozen of those learning sessions.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   Some of the people had real success with some of the training from my research.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.240]   They asked me to write a book.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.400]   I was reluctant because I'd never written a book before.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.820]   I didn't know how to even go about it.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:33.420]   That took another six months of research on how to write a book.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.520]   That took me to Rich Habits.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.480]   I ended up spending about a year writing Rich Habits.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.360]   I stumbled in the beginning.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:50.480]   I had two manuscripts that I ended up throwing out and I settled on a template that I used
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.200]   was Aguilino's Greatest Salesman in the World.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.760]   It was a great book.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.840]   My initial template was The Millionaire Next Door.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.800]   I had about 350 pages of graphs and data.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   Someone whose opinion I value a great deal sent the manuscript back and said, "This
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:16.160]   is great for college students or postgraduate work, but you're not going to help anybody
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.900]   who really wants to change their life."
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.840]   He sent back the manuscript with a copy of Aguilino's book.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.120]   I'd never read it before, so I read it and I realized, "Oh my God, this is what I
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.760]   really want to write."
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.440]   I kind of mirrored his book.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.560]   I used it as the format and Rich Habits was the end result.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.960]   It's a good format for those who haven't read Greatest Salesman in the World.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.320]   It's kind of a combination of what you call a parable.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.680]   It's almost a story with a bit of instruction and an overall narrative parable and then
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.520]   a focused parable within a parable somehow.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.080]   I don't quite know how to name the genre, but it's a useful style.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:08.360]   I think of even books similar in some ways to Richest Man in Babylon as a narrative format,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.280]   but you're trying to use that to teach these certain steps.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   That's right.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:21.120]   I wanted to tell a story and weave into the story the rich habits somehow and that's
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.720]   what I tried to do.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   It's accessible.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.960]   I want to ask you a follow-up question on your research.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.680]   The way that I first came across – by the way, I really enjoyed both of your books.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:39.100]   The way that I came across your name, though, however, was after you gave an interview on
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.680]   Dave Ramsey's show.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:47.800]   Then later he published a blog post that listed out some of the data from your research.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   Well, that blog post went on to become quite the controversial topic.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.520]   That was when I came across it was after hearing about the controversy.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.360]   When I read the blog post, though, everything within me wanted to jump up and down and say,
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   "Yes, this is awesome."
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:11.640]   Just to cite a few example statistics of how this data is presented, things like 80% of
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.320]   the wealthy are focused on accomplishing some single goal.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.280]   Only 12% of the poor focus on a single goal.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.680]   Or 63% of the wealthy listen to audio books during their commute to work versus 5% of
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.920]   poor people.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.880]   Or 63% of wealthy parents make their children read two or more nonfiction books a month
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.160]   versus 3% of poor.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.600]   There are many other data points that are cited.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.840]   My reaction to that was as a lifelong self-learner and someone who's been focused for a very
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.940]   long time on my own personal development, I wanted to jump up and down and say, "Yes,
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.120]   this is the greatest thing of all time for the personal development industry.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.440]   Here's the data."
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.120]   That immediately made me become suspicious because of the ability to actually trust the
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.760]   data because it almost seems like too perfect of a package.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:03.840]   It feels more like you invented numbers to match a story rather than pulling a story
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.840]   out of the numbers.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.480]   So, two questions for you.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:15.760]   Number one, has anybody questioned or affirmed the statistical validity of your sample set?
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.360]   Secondly, did you go into it with a perception of thinking what you were going to find or
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   did you approach it as a pure researcher?
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   On the first question, I have sent some data to different people, particularly after that
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.680]   CNN article came out that lambasted me and Dave Ramsey.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.520]   They got so much wrong in that article.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.720]   Welcome to modern life.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.900]   Including my name.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.120]   My name is Tom Corley, not Tim Corley.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:57.560]   My brother Tim is a top dog at the DEA, so he wasn't too happy about that.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:05.760]   Anyway, it's hard for me to send the entire research because there's four -- I mean, it
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.960]   fills up an entire filing cabinet.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.480]   What I was doing was sending out the research summary and some other information that I
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:19.120]   had that I knew would make it more accessible to people and easier to look at.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.040]   And then they wanted to know my demographics.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:28.080]   I've got a hundred questions that people ask me and I tried to respond to each one of them.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.620]   How many were white?
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.620]   How many were black?
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.240]   How many were -- what were the nationalities?
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   How many were male?
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   How many were female?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   And I have all of that.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.560]   And so, how much was their wealth?
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.040]   And I have all that.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.280]   So, I sent all that stuff out as best as I could, which took a lot of time, but it was
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   worth it.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   So, I did.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.240]   There was a little bit of vetting going on there.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.440]   And the second part of your question was -- just repeat that again, Joshua.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.520]   I was just saying, like, in the book, you talk about it using the narrative that you
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.320]   tell in the book as from the perspective of, "Well, I was starting to do the research to
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.480]   figure out what was wrong in my life as the accountant, your protagonist.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.120]   I was just curious if you were actually starting from that place yourself or if you were coming
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.360]   from a place of more experience and then kind of having an idea of what you would find and
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.000]   then actually digging into it."
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.840]   Well, you know, I think part of the problem is, one, I hated wealthy people when I started
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.560]   doing this research.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.600]   You know, because my story was we were rich and then we were poor and I spent most of
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600]   my life in poverty.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.960]   So I had a real -- just from growing up, my mother was the homemaker.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:48.440]   And, you know, some of the things that through my upbringing that I -- some of the beliefs
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.960]   that I held were not too favorable to wealthy people.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.440]   I really didn't like them at all.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:00.000]   So there was a prejudice there, which probably is contrary to what, like, CNN was thinking.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.760]   So, you know, I think for sure that affected me.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.340]   But what happened during this whole research project is I went from hating the wealthy
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.340]   people to admiring them.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:22.320]   And it was sort of catharsis for me because then I said, "Wow, you know, I've got this
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.320]   all backwards."
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:30.720]   I mean, I really -- I really grew up in a way that we had most of these poverty habits
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.480]   and we didn't have a lot of the rich habits.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.400]   And so I was -- I don't know if that makes me objective or subjective, but it is what
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   it is.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.560]   And the other part of it was I was a CPA and a financial planner, so I was in constant
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.080]   contact with wealthy people.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.840]   And that part of it, you know, a lot of my best clients were my wealthy clients.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.440]   You know, they were the nicest ones.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.360]   They were the ones who were in constant contact with me, communication.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.240]   They weren't -- you know, the ones that I struggled with were the people in the middle
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.440]   class or who were trying to get out of the middle class who were constantly complaining
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.120]   about their fees and the time I spent on stuff.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.840]   They were the ones that gave me the heartache, not the wealthy people.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.520]   So a lot of these things were kind of playing in my mind.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.800]   And so when I wrote Rich Habits, I guess I had -- I was at that point where I had reached
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.720]   a conclusion that wealthy people weren't bad people after all and that this information
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.360]   needs to get out there because, you know, society, especially nowadays, everybody's
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.480]   beating up on the wealthy.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:41.280]   And they're, you know, with all that happened in 2008 and 2009, it didn't help.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.800]   So I said, well, you know, I'm going to write a book about this.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.720]   I'm just going to lay it out there and, you know, I don't know if I'm going to sell
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.880]   one book or a million books, but I'm just going to try and write something that I think
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   is truthful.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:01.400]   But, you know, the other part of what you said is, you know, I have over 300 data points.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:08.960]   And some of the data points, they don't fit the narrative necessarily that, you know,
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.080]   wealthy are this or poor are that.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.700]   Some of them are pretty close.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:22.320]   And so the only data points that the media picked up on or wanted to highlight were the
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.020]   ones that showed the big differences between the wealthy and the poor.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.840]   So I don't know if that helps explain it.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   Yeah, it's useful.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.320]   And I'm sorry to lead off with an aggressive question.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.280]   But as we get into the habits, I love the material that you presented so much.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.400]   But I'm, as I already said, I was so immediately fearful of, wait a second, I love it too much.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.080]   I'm immediately suspicious of the objectiveness of it.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.560]   Because all of the habits that you outline in the book are habits that I have learned
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.520]   over time from other people that I have been taught and that I've worked hard to implement.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.680]   So it's easy to get into a position of confirmation bias of, well, I've already figured those
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   out.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.400]   So absolutely, this is exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.880]   So let me outline the habits real quick just for those who obviously haven't read the book.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.640]   And just a summary from early in the book.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.640]   I'll read just one paragraph here as a summary.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.480]   That the summary of the Rich Habits promises is that I will form good daily habits and
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.240]   follow these good daily habits each and every day.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.120]   I will set goals for each day, for each month, for each year, and for the long term.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.080]   I will focus on my goals each and every day.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.920]   I will engage in self-improvement each and every day.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.280]   I will devote part of each and every day in caring for my health.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.080]   I will devote part of each and every day to forming lifelong relationships.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.960]   I will live each and every day in a state of moderation.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.280]   I will accomplish my daily tasks each and every day.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.320]   I will adopt a do-it-now mindset.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.720]   I will engage in rich thinking each and every day.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.640]   I will save 10% of my gross income every paycheck.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.240]   I will control my thoughts and emotions each and every day.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.400]   Each of those is expanded in many chapters across the two books.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.280]   But in looking at that list, it's certainly intuitive when you look at it and say, "Any
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.560]   person, starting from any place, if they would implement those habits consistently in the
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.760]   fullness of time, they're going to experience a massive change in their life."
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.040]   This is really the core of my research.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:37.680]   It's the little things that you do every single day that change your life or create the life
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.720]   that you have.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.760]   These little things are habits.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.560]   They're the little habits that we have.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.080]   Habits are, because they're unconscious, for the most part, they're unconscious activity.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.680]   In a book that I'm writing right now that's actually at the publisher, they're working
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.160]   on it, "Change Your Habits, Change Your Life," I get into a lot of neurogenesis, neuroplasticity,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.600]   and how the brain works with respect to habits and how the habits can increase your intelligence
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.120]   and your IQ and things like that.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   There's a lot of cool stuff that I'm unearthing from my research that ties into science and
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.720]   neurology.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.480]   I think that I've really stumbled onto something profound.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   I know it's my calling in life.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.560]   I'm going to be doing this until the day I die, whether I make any money on it or not.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.360]   How has your life changed since you started to understand the habits that your wealthy
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.640]   clients implemented and to implement them in your own life to a greater degree?
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:51.960]   I can tell you that there are two things that have changed dramatically for me.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.840]   One is my weight.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.280]   Some of the research had to do with health.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.920]   I didn't understand why wealthy people were healthy people, but they are.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:09.000]   I found out why, because if you're healthy, you can make more money.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.120]   You're more productive.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.160]   You have fewer sick days.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.600]   You can't make money out of a hospital bed.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.880]   A lot of the wealthy people take care of their health.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.200]   Even before they're wealthy, they got into that habit.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.920]   I was able to create something I call the tracking schedule.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.600]   I call it my rich habits weight management system.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:41.040]   I was able to go from 214 pounds in July of 2007 down to 174 pounds in February of 2008
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:51.800]   just by tracking my calories in, calories out, and the amount of exercise.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.080]   That was one profound thing.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.400]   I'm now very healthy.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.680]   I'm at probably 185 to 190 pounds.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.760]   I exercise every day.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.320]   I watch what I eat.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.280]   That's had a profound impact on me.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.960]   The second thing is it shined a light on one of the things that wealthy people do, which
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.200]   is they create multiple streams of income.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.840]   Almost all the wealthy people in my study had three streams of income.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   Some had four.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.800]   Some had five or more.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.520]   What I started doing was that was just about when I got into financial planning.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.480]   I said, "I'm going to go."
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.120]   The research made me realize that I had to add multiple streams of income, and financial
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.000]   planning was the first stream I added.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.680]   Then I started adding other streams.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.080]   I started doing some of the training.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.760]   That became an income stream.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.960]   Some of the speaking engagements, that became an income stream.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:53.280]   Of course, the royalties from the book, that's an income stream.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:59.960]   Now I've got five streams of income, whereas before my research, I had one.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.280]   I think those two things have—my income's doubled.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.720]   It's not by accident.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:11.440]   I have a whole one stream of income that gives me half of my income and four streams of income
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.280]   that give me my other half.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.600]   I think that, to me, was really important.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.320]   I didn't know that wealthy people had multiple streams of income.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:28.240]   How has your personal self-development plan changed since this transformative research,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   since you started about seven, eight years ago?
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.080]   Now I wake up a quarter to five in the morning.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.720]   I didn't before.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.200]   I spend about an hour reading for learning.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.120]   That was something I picked up in my research.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.720]   In my business, I always had to do technical reading, but I never processed it, to be honest
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.120]   with you, Joshua.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.760]   I did my reading in bursts.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.520]   I'd spend a Saturday and read for five hours or something like that.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.080]   Wealthy people process their learning every day.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.560]   I found about 30 minutes a day is what the wealthy devoted to learning.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:11.040]   I said, "Well, if I do 60, maybe I'll get wealthier quicker."
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.880]   I've been doing that since 2006, I guess.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.160]   I read everything, anything and everything that has to do with learning.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:27.680]   Right now, I'm reading books on history and on successful people.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.640]   What I do is I read the books, and then I highlight the important sections.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.320]   Then I sit down and I transcribe it onto a piece of paper, and I put it into a binder
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.720]   that I now call my fact binder.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.480]   That is helping me learn more and become more knowledgeable.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:52.240]   It does have a positive impact on my life because now I'm able to converse with people
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.080]   on many subjects that I wasn't able to before.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.880]   The exercise, I always was pretty good at exercise, but again, I didn't process it.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   I was doing it in bursts.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:13.640]   I'd do four months during the spring and the summer, and then I'd tail off and I wouldn't
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.400]   do it again.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   When I learned that wealthy people exercise every day, so now I do.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:25.520]   The key is to do your exercise, not an enormous amount of exercise, but a little bit every
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   day.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.720]   If you do a little bit every day, for me it's 30 minutes to 60 minutes every day.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   If you do a little bit, you'll do it every day.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:44.560]   If you do too much or you put too much of a—where you're obligated to do too many,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.720]   too much minutes, you're going to fall off.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.120]   There are days that I only do 25 minutes a day of aerobic exercise.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   There are days where I do an hour and a half that includes weightlifting now.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.680]   I just incorporated that about a year and a half ago.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.440]   I'm trying to stay as healthy as I can.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.200]   I guess those are some of the benefits that I derive from the research.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.720]   When you wrote the book, had you previously or when you started the research, prior to
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.880]   starting the research, had you been publishing within your industry within the accounting
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   field?
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.640]   Yeah, that's an important point.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.920]   Good point.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.080]   Most of my writing was technical.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.640]   I'd write about IRAs.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.160]   I'd write about SPIAs.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:33.240]   I'd write about tax issues, commodity traders, and all hosts of different things that were
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.640]   specifically related to my expertise.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:46.480]   I guess I had the writing down in a sense that I knew how to write an article.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.400]   It turns out I'm a pretty good writer.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.920]   My grammar is good.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   I always knew that.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.560]   Even when I was writing the technical articles, I knew I had some good grammatical skills.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.080]   I didn't always.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:04.400]   I had to read a couple of grammar books so I could understand where commas go and where
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:11.640]   parentheses go and where the apostrophes go and all that stuff, quotes, commas, and that
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   stuff.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.960]   But since I did my research and I started writing Rich Habits, I started doing more
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.920]   reading about grammar and writing skills.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.440]   That's helped me.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.760]   The reason I ask is what I was trying to figure out.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.040]   Let me give you just my 30-second review of the books.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.080]   I enjoyed both of them.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.320]   I preferred actually your second book, Rich Kids.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.620]   Although I thought Rich Habits was good, in Rich Kids you brought together all of the
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:48.560]   rich habits but with much greater granularity.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:54.840]   It's a very pithy book with many, many things that can be highlighted and many valuable
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.040]   lessons.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.960]   It's one of those things where I constantly found myself saying, "Ah, he's including
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.340]   one idea here.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.900]   He just listed it in one sentence in the middle of a piece of dialogue, but this is a key
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:13.880]   idea that if somebody were to read this multiple times and they focused on this idea here brought
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.040]   artfully into the dialogue, just that idea alone is worth the price of admission times
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.220]   100."
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.600]   I really thought it was extremely well-written.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:28.120]   What I'm most interested in, as is probably apparent from my questions, because the audience
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.720]   can read the books, what I'm most interested in is the changes in your life.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:40.160]   You had so much personal development material in Rich Kids.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.240]   It's fascinating for me to try to figure out how much came from the wealthy people that
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.160]   you talked to and how much came from what talking to the wealthy people caused you to
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.820]   do which was to up your personal development regimen and then finding all of the many other
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.360]   ideas that have been well-written about by personal development authors.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.640]   Do you have a sense as to the varying impact of the changes in your own personal habits
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.240]   versus the wealthy people's input?
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.880]   Yeah, I'll be honest with you.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:17.320]   I would say probably 30% of the interviews that I did with the wealthy people were in-person
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.400]   interviews.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:25.480]   The rest were either primarily on the phone, but the in-person interviews had more of an
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.160]   impact on me when I was sitting across from them.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.880]   I guess a good example is this one individual who was 67 years old.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:42.160]   He was worth about $17 million and he's still working, Joshua.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   I asked him the question, I said, "Why are you still working?
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.740]   You have $17 million.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:53.480]   You could be traveling, you could be enjoying your life and doing fun things."
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.920]   He looked at me like I was crazy.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.760]   You can only get that when you're sitting across from someone.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.440]   They're body language, right?
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.560]   He looked at me like I was crazy.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:08.840]   I'll be honest with you, I felt like I was an idiot for asking the question the way he
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   looked at me.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.920]   He said, "Look, I've been exercising for 45 years.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.080]   I've been watching what I eat."
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.760]   He was probably 5'9" and 140 pounds or something.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.720]   He said, "I did all of that because I knew at the end of my career, that would be when
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.600]   I made the most money.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.720]   I was trying to squeeze an extra four or five years out of my career."
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.480]   The impact that that had on me was, "Oh my God, I've really got to exercise more and
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   take care of my health more."
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.880]   Because he's right, I'm going to make more money at the end of my career than probably
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.360]   the last four years or five years of my career, I'll make more money than I made in my first
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   20 years.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   How old are you now?
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   I'm 54.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.600]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Right.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.720]   Dr. Andrew Hill: So that's when I said I'm—I was all in after that.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.800]   After he said that, that's when I started creating the Rich Habits Weight Management
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:13.600]   Program and I started processing my workout routine and started watching what I ate.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.200]   I don't think I would have had the same impact if I was talking to him on the phone.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:27.400]   So yeah, I would tell you that the face-to-face meetings, they had the most impact on me and
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.320]   they altered my behavior the most.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.640]   And of course, they worked their way into my research but the impact was already there
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.360]   before the research was done.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.960]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: The lesson I'd like to focus on from what you just shared is there's
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:46.480]   nothing that you have done that any person listening to my voice can't do themselves.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.400]   One of the success habits that I've tried to have over the years is to always invest
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.360]   a certain percentage of my income back into my own personal development.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.320]   My numbers have fluctuated from anywhere from a few percent to 10%.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.240]   But when you look and say, "Okay, if we use as a good example the 10% number and we
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.400]   say how can I invest 10% of my income back into myself which is in my opinion a far better
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.520]   investment to start with than buying mutual funds, then all of a sudden when you have
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.040]   a budget, it leads you to the question of what do I do.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.400]   So in the early years, I might be reading a book.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   But one of the habits that I've tried to implement is consistently connecting with
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.040]   anybody that I admired, whether that was somebody that I admired for their financial success,
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.440]   I knew they were wealthy, whether it was somebody I admired their character, and just set aside
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.000]   a lunch budget and take that person out to lunch.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.080]   And almost anybody will be happy to be invited out to a nice place for lunch and be asked
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   to talk about themselves obviously if it's clear that there's no ulterior motive other
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.560]   than to learn.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:56.280]   And what has emerged from my doing that is feeling like when I was reading your book,
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.920]   you had all the same conversations that I've had.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.600]   You learned all the same things that I've learned from other people that I've talked
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.840]   to and the reality is success is simple.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.320]   It's not easy but it's simple.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:15.000]   It's a matter of implementing a systematic process, some core habits, some key ideas
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.440]   and then giving enough time for those actions to lead to the ultimate effect that you are
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.800]   expecting.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.600]   And so I've zeroed in.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.160]   I don't know if you've given I'm sure many interviews but I've zeroed in more on your
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:35.520]   story than the content of your books because what I perceived in reading your books was
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:41.320]   that this was a very transformative experience for you and it's something that every listener
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.360]   can model and repeat and duplicate themselves.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.880]   Yeah, you know, that's a great point.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:54.120]   I was just thinking about this over the last couple of months because my mindset now before
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.400]   I worried about everything.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.200]   I worried about primarily my business.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.320]   I worried about my family.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.160]   I thought about these worries as a negative thinking, right?
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:13.840]   And when I started talking to all these wealthy people, Joshua was as if they didn't have
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.520]   a problem in the world and I thought, "My God, isn't it great to be wealthy where you
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.960]   have no problems?"
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.040]   But that wasn't the case.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.320]   They had probably ten times the amount of things to worry about that I had because they
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.880]   had four or five streams of income.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.000]   They had to worry about each of those streams, right?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.800]   But what they got into the habit of doing was what now I call positive thinking or rich
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.360]   thinking.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.240]   They stopped thinking negative thoughts.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.560]   And I just wrote a great piece on that this morning.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:51.160]   My tip of the morning to you was unhealthy thoughts.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:56.840]   And it's with all the stuff that's going on in the news with Donald Trump and McCain and
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:03.920]   the Iraq, the Iran nuclear thing and all these murders going on, all these riots.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.880]   You know, I see on social media all these people, you can tell that they're ticked off
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.640]   and they're going at each other.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.600]   And that used to be me.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.760]   And now I look at it and I said, "These people are just wasting their time.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.840]   They're thinking about things that they can't possibly control."
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.720]   And I think that's the main point.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   What the wealthy people worried about, if they were worrying, was only about the things
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.680]   that were within their control.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.000]   The things that the circumstances that they could have control over.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.560]   They didn't worry about all these other things that all of us think about and that cause
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:46.240]   worry and that cause stress and that creates, you know, the cortisol production and unhealthy
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.080]   living.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.400]   So I've been thinking about the last three months because my mindset right now is, I
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.720]   feel like I'm almost worry free.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:01.800]   And I believe this is absolutely a byproduct of all this research and these people that
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.600]   I've been exposed to.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:09.040]   I would say you have good reason, not only just from the mental perspective, but you
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.240]   have good reason to feel fewer worries.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.840]   And certainly there are always going to be problems.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.040]   The richer you get and the older you get, it seems to me, the bigger your problems get.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.040]   But with regard to the worries, if you think about the transformation that's happened in
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:32.480]   your life and in your career, to go from a respected accountant to leading a larger financial
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.800]   planning firm with multiple areas of business to establishing a personal brand that goes
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.880]   beyond your professional capacity, that just gives you so many more backup options and
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.840]   backup plans that if your business fell apart, just even the personal network that you've
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   developed from your publishing work gives you a whole host of opportunities that would
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:58.360]   not exist if you were a staff accountant at a large international tax firm.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:04.760]   Yeah, I think that the important point to highlight here is, without me really knowing
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:11.560]   it, I was pursuing what is now my main purpose in life, teaching these rich habits and continuing
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.640]   this work that I'm doing.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:19.320]   And I think that's part of the reason why I feel so mentally content.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.960]   I found my calling in life.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.200]   And I think when you find your calling in life, when you pursue that thing that you're
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:34.440]   passionate about, I really think it transforms your mind from negative to positive just almost
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:44.120]   by default because what you're doing is you're stoking the fires inside of you.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.440]   The passion doesn't go away.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.320]   It gets bigger when you pursue your main purpose in life.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.240]   So I think that part of the reason I'm content is I now know I'm doing what I'm going to
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.100]   be doing until the day I die.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.920]   How many of us can say that?
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:04.040]   Most of us, 95%, aren't crazy about their job.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:09.720]   In fact, in my research, only 7% actually loved their job, even the wealthy, 7% of the
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.320]   wealthy, only 7% loved what they did for a living.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.520]   But I'm telling you I love what I'm doing with this rich habits and I feel that that's
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:24.600]   because it's my main purpose and it's the reason I'm feeling worry-free right now because
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.800]   I'm doing what I was intended to do.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.440]   How much is your personal vision?
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.500]   And we can think about this and you pick which of these you want to answer, but your personal
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.840]   vision, and let's talk about it in the context of your own personal financial plan, your
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.080]   own numbers on paper, what you project for your own life, or just think about it with
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:47.280]   your own future mirror letter to the 70-year-old you, the 80-year-old you, the 90-year-old
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.040]   you or your obituary.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.080]   How much has your personal vision changed over the last 10 years?
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.720]   Oh, it's completely different.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:03.220]   Prior to this, I felt, well, I was very good at taxes and I liked taxes, but it wasn't
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.220]   something I loved.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:09.540]   I mean, let's be honest, you're preparing tax returns, you're dealing with usually stressful
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:16.100]   situations, so there's all of that that goes into the tax career.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:27.200]   I think that because my whole mindset shifted when I started pursuing this, it's of course
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:34.560]   improved my life financially, and now what I'm thinking about is, okay, I'm going to
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.200]   make some moves in my life.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.600]   Some of the things that I've always wanted to do, my wife and I used to live down by
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.040]   the shore, the Jersey Shore, so we're going to end up selling our house and we're going
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.080]   to move down by the Jersey Shore.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.160]   That's something we always wanted to do.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.600]   I could never afford to do it before.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.560]   Now I'm having some success in life and I'm getting close to being able to afford to do
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   that.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.400]   I'm feeling that I'm going to have a retirement now.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.960]   I didn't feel confident about that before.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:11.080]   I feel confident about a lot of things, I guess is the main point that I wasn't confident
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.680]   about before because I know I'm on the right path.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.840]   You just know it, Joshua.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.680]   It's not something that if you have to ponder whether or not you're on the right path, you're
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.080]   not.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.800]   I can tell you that because I don't think about it anymore.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.400]   I know this is the right path and I know I'm going to benefit.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:36.120]   When you help other people improve their lives, you derive a benefit from it.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.400]   Oftentimes, it's financial.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.360]   I'm confident now that this is just going to grow.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.560]   I'm going to help more and more people.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.680]   I'm going to make more and more money.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:54.040]   My success is going to increase incrementally over the next 20 or 30 years.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.160]   I'm tickled pink that I'm in the situation that I'm in right now.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.480]   When I read Rich Kids, and the premise of the book is the narrative that you used is
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.840]   a father on his way to college with his son recounting some early childhood experiences
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.000]   that the father had had with his grandfather back in the early 1980s.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.480]   It's this cross-generational narrative.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.680]   When I was reading it, I had the distinct impression that you were writing the vision
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   for your life at 67 years old and you were writing about the summer that you intend to
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.240]   have with your grandson.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:34.000]   You were clearly identifying each of the personal goals and the personal lifestyle that you're
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.920]   interested in developing for yourself.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.000]   Am I right?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   You are spot on.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.120]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.320]   What's interesting about what you just mentioned is this.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.840]   Most of us, we're kind of like leaves.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.440]   I write about it in Rich Habits.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.400]   We're kind of like leaves on a fall day, just kind of floating around.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:01.800]   When I wrote Rich Habits, and also Rich Kids, but Rich Habits got me started on this, I
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.200]   said I'm going to write the main character.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.840]   It's going to be a future version of me.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   J.C.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.000]   Jobs is really the future version of me.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.440]   When I wrote Rich Kids, you were exactly right.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:22.360]   I was thinking about my grandkids and teaching them and instilling in them, mentoring them
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.120]   through all these habits and these strategies.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   It's much easier.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:36.440]   Where I'm going with this is where you can benefit from this is if you just sit down
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:42.640]   and write a 500 to 1,000 word narrative on the future version of yourself, the ideal
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:51.680]   perfect future Joshua Sheets, it gets your subconscious mind working behind the scenes.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.780]   It starts nudging you.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.800]   We have this thing called intuition.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:01.480]   It starts nudging you with intuition on, "Hey Joshua, you should do X or you should do Y
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   or don't do this or don't do that."
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.880]   It's almost like a GPS.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:13.140]   It starts moving you in a different direction, but it all starts with crafting a narrative
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.680]   of your ideal future life.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.280]   I think that's the most important thing you can do.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.000]   It's a beautiful, even just your vision is a beautiful vision.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.480]   I found it's in many ways similar to some of my visions.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.080]   I've never published them.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.880]   What you describe is a grandfather being able to take an entire summer and just experience
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:41.040]   this incredible joy-filled summer with his grandson.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.680]   That involves the grandfather showing his grandson and his grandson's friend around
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:53.800]   the country in an incredible lifestyle, able to easily afford all of these peak experiences.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.520]   Everything is fully connected.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.880]   It's the peak experiences of a helicopter ride over New York City or an RV trip through
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.520]   the Shenandoah Mountains to go and get the best burger in the world from New Orleans.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:11.000]   All the time, it's done with health and vitality.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.480]   It's one of those visions that's compelling.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.640]   When I compare that to the vision that many people have, at least what I've worked with
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:22.320]   in financial planning, many people have a vision that's so boring, there's no ability
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.960]   for it to compel them to anything.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.960]   With you have a small vision, there's small motivation to actually get up and do anything
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.280]   to put the vision into practice.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.880]   I found it to be inspiring because in many ways, it mirrors some of my own vision.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:42.680]   It's a retirement years that aren't retirement at all, but it's something that's worth looking
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:49.360]   forward to instead of this horrifying US-American archetype that we have of age being something
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.680]   to be feared and dreaded.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:59.280]   Why is it that our end game is retirement and then doing nothing, when what it should
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:05.360]   be is pursuing something that you're passionate about until the day you die?
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   That's what J.C.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   Jobs did.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:17.800]   He was still at the age of 67 and teaching and educating, and he was doing it around
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   the country.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.280]   He was never going to stop.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.600]   That's the way I feel.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:29.360]   I think that when you create, most people, like you said, lack a vision of where they
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.880]   want to go.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.680]   Their vision might be just that they're going to retire, but what happens after that?
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   You die.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:47.240]   If your vision is real enough to you, it's going to alter your behavior.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.400]   It's going to change the course of your life, and I think you're spot on.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:57.520]   Most people don't create a vision for their ideal perfect life, and as a result, their
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.520]   vision is limited to retiring.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.640]   I'd like to dig deeper on one of the pieces of research, one of the wealth habits that
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.920]   you have listed in your book.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.240]   In my experience, I personally began in the professional world of financial planning at
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:18.200]   the age of 23, following years and years of consuming personal finance suggestions.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:24.680]   What I thought was the path to wealth was to save and invest heavily in my retirement
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.800]   accounts and to always put a portion of my money aside and to invest it appropriately
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.120]   in a diversified portfolio of mutual funds, because that was what the personal finance
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.840]   books recommended to me.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.640]   When I started working as a financial planner and had the opportunity to be face-to-face
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.080]   over six years in the trenches with over a thousand people, many of whom were wealthy,
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.440]   I started to notice a trend, and the trend was the fact that none of my wealthy clients
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.480]   ever became wealthy because of saving 10% of their income.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:59.120]   Rather, they actually became wealthy because they had built a business that was extremely
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:04.600]   valuable or they had developed an extremely high income so that when they naturally saved
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:10.000]   a percentage of their income, the compounding effect of 10% of a $400,000 income was so
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.200]   massive that they almost couldn't help but become wealthy.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:22.600]   My question is I concur absolutely that saving is an important discipline because of who
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:28.280]   it can transform you to be and because it can provide the capital to be able to build
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.400]   future businesses, to invest in future opportunities.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.820]   But in your research, did you ever find that anybody who is wealthy actually became wealthy
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:42.520]   through what's taught on the front page of Yahoo Finance or CNN Money, put 10% of
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.240]   your money into a Roth IRA, buy an index fund in it and leave it alone for 50 years?
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:52.280]   Or did you find that the majority of the wealthy had achieved it through private business and
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.640]   a very high income?
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.560]   >>John: Yeah, boy, that is a great question.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:10.120]   Well, 51% of the wealthy in my study were business owners and 177 of them were self-made
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.400]   millionaires, meaning they came from nothing.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:22.120]   But there were a good percentage that-- I'm thinking of one individual right now who was
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   an attorney and he worked most of his life for the government, which you don't make a
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.960]   lot of money, right?
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   But what he did that was different is he didn't invest in mutual funds and stuff like that.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.980]   He invested in individual stocks.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:45.680]   And then he would reinvest-- there were two individuals in my study who did this.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:53.880]   And so he has now-- well, at the time, he had about $4 million in stock that he probably
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:49:00.600]   invested $400,000 in over the years just by living below his means and just investing
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   in those stocks.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.400]   The other guy was a little bit lower than $4 million.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.640]   So they did it that way.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:13.560]   But the vast majority of the individuals in my study who were wealthy, where the savings
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.880]   came into play was to give them just what you said, the seed capital to start a business
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:24.200]   and to do something with that money, whether it was start a business or real estate or
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:30.280]   invest it in some way that created a revenue stream before they were retired.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:36.320]   So they were investing their savings and then doubling down on it, and they just built an
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.240]   empire essentially.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.920]   So there's two ways.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.680]   There's really three ways that you can become wealthy.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.200]   This is really-- it boils down to three things, in my opinion.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:53.320]   You either live below your means, you either expand your means, or you do both.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   And the ones that made the most money or had the most net worth of all the millionaires
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.720]   were the ones that were doing both.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.340]   They had gotten into the habit of living below their means and saving.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:06.760]   And then they expanded their means.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:12.080]   They took their money and they invested it in something, and they just persistently pursued
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.520]   it until they were successful.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:19.880]   So I think the savings is important, but if you really want to get rich, if you really
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:27.120]   want to be wealthy, you've got to deploy that savings in a way that's going to involve risk.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:31.360]   I'll give you a-- I love-- I think that's a good model.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.360]   I'll give you my model.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.600]   I'm working on a manuscript of the Radical Personal Finance book.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.160]   And I've boiled it down into three essential functions.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.240]   And these are the functions that will ultimately guarantee, no question about it, determine
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.780]   how much wealth you have.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.340]   Number one is the amount of your income.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.080]   Number two is the amount of your expenses.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.420]   And number three, the rate of return that you earn on the difference.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.720]   And there are two more pieces to the model, but they don't-- they're not numerical components.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:05.080]   If you look at each wealthy person, you can create a formula for wealth regardless of
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:09.840]   the numbers of theirs as long as the income are in excess of the-- as long as income is
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.760]   in excess of the expenses.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:16.240]   But if you want a fast-- if you want a fast growth to wealth or if you want to achieve
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.720]   massive wealth, you need to really amp up one or more of those categories, ideally all
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.080]   three except that usually most people don't do all three.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:31.800]   But if you could have the highest income possible and you could have the lowest expenses possible
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   and you could invest at the highest rate of return that's ever been achieved, guaranteed
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.320]   you're going to achieve massive wealth quickly.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.780]   Hard to do all three of those things well, which is often why you see people focusing
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.040]   on one or the other.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:50.040]   And so the long, slow route to wealth, the people are taught, get a good job, earn $60,000
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:57.960]   a year, save $6,000 a year in your IRA from 25 to 65 and earn 8% annualized on your funds.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.640]   Yes, that will make you a millionaire over the course of a 40-year process.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.240]   But if you take the same $60,000 income and you drop it to $20,000 a year of expenses,
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.620]   so now you're able to invest $40,000 a year at the same 8%, now you move into the world
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:20.040]   of early retirees, of the extreme frugality folks of which this show speaks and we speak
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.760]   a lot of that language.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.620]   Pretty reliable thing to do if you can discipline yourself to live on very low expenses.
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:31.200]   Or if you're more attracted to the business route, which is the main way, I want to emphasize
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.560]   177 of the people that you – excuse me, 51% of the wealthy that you interviewed were
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.840]   business owners.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.800]   If you go to the general population and you compare that 51% number to whatever the number
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.520]   percentage is in the population of actual business owners, you'll see that why the
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.360]   massive amounts of wealth are concentrated in the hands of entrepreneurs.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:59.240]   But back to the model, you can also earn $60,000 a year and spend $50,000 a year and then you
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   can create an app that grows at annualized returns of hundreds of percents a year.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.200]   There you have a situation of a Mark Zuckerberg or those types of people or you can create
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.840]   a business that grows at say 30% to 50% a year and there you have your local car dealer
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:20.320]   and it takes a little longer than Mark Zuckerberg but over time that person is growing.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.720]   So what I love about your books and that's a long-winded compliment to kind of further
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:31.000]   the discussion is that you brought together the personal development side and the business
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.760]   side with some of the financial concepts.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.280]   I hope that in your future writing you continue that especially given your background as an
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.180]   accountant and a financial planner.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.440]   We need more of that in the financial planning industry.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.240]   We need a lot less here's how you choose between an IRA and a Roth IRA.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.500]   When you look at the facts which are the vast majority of Americans are broke and they're
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:58.240]   never going to retire and we've been repeating the same tired problem for 30, 40, 50 years,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.880]   we'll just invest money in the stock market into your IRA.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.480]   The reality is it doesn't work.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.880]   It's not that it can't work, it can work if you reliably do consistently do it but the
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.160]   vast majority of people have shown that they're not going to do it so therefore it doesn't
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.620]   work except for a very small percentage.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:18.040]   But these other strategies put together when you combine personal development and strong
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:22.400]   personal habits and then you go ahead and say well what's a tax efficient and cost efficient
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.640]   way of investing and I'm going to allocate some of my investments over here into passive
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.440]   investments that aren't connected to whether or not my General Motors franchise succeeds
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:35.840]   or fails because GM has a massive recall, then you get into wise financial planning
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.280]   which is where we can really help and serve the public.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:41.520]   Yeah, everything you said I agree with.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:49.080]   I think that's why I'm really trying to get this information out there because having
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:56.880]   been rich as a kid and then grown up poor, it's clear to me that most people are doing
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.880]   it wrong.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:02.040]   In fact, my mother, I just went to visit my mother who's in a rehabilitation facility
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.280]   on Sunday.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   She's reading my book Rich Kids and she said you know I feel bad because I didn't teach
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.780]   you any of this stuff and I said I know.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.320]   That's why I struggled for so many years.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:19.160]   I said I'm trying to help other families so that their kids don't have to struggle like
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.560]   I did and we did in my family.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:26.120]   I said it's all about education, Joshua.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.280]   It's actually what it boils down to is parenting.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:35.760]   If parents take on the responsibility of even if they're non-millionaire parents, take on
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.000]   the responsibility of teaching their kids some of these good habits and these good strategies,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.640]   they will put their kids ahead of the eight ball because their competition isn't learning
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.720]   this stuff.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.960]   I'm seeing it right now with my son who just is into his third year working.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.240]   He's knocking it out of the park.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:59.160]   He's my guinea pig because while I was doing this research, I would come home and I would
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.720]   say, "Brendan, you got to do this," or "Brendan, you got to do that."
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.400]   He's the first one out of the gate.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.920]   He's knocking it out of the park.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.160]   I'm not kidding.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.440]   He's doing so well.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.760]   He's doing everything I told him to do because now when you get college kids, it's hard to
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.120]   teach them anything.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.160]   When they get out in the work world, they realize, "Oh, it's not that easy.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.080]   There are certain rules you got to follow."
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.640]   He's now realizing a lot of stuff that I taught him is going to help him in his professional
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   career.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.680]   He's using it and he's having success.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:38.360]   I wish I could just get inside the head of every parent in this country and give them
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:43.080]   the same sense of importance that I feel that this stuff deserves.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:49.000]   I think too many of them are too busy watching the Kardashians or Bruce Jenner or whatever
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:55.400]   you call them now, Caitlyn Jenner, and they're not interested in doing the things you need
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.040]   to do in order to succeed in life.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.840]   Tom: Other than reading your book, I want to give you a couple of minutes and just share
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:07.920]   some ideas of where a parent listening who's looking at their son or daughter and saying,
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.360]   "I want to really help my son or daughter with some education that's helpful," what
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.720]   would be some of the core ideas that you would like them to teach to their kids and how would
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.120]   they go about doing that at a young age?
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:23.160]   Dr. Fauci: One of the great stories is Dr. Ben Carson.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:29.120]   He grew up in the ghettos of Detroit and he had a brother and it was a single parent.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.180]   His mom raised them.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:35.500]   She used to clean the houses of wealthy people and she used to listen in on their conversations
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.560]   and watch what they did.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:42.160]   One of the things she noticed is that they all read every single day they read.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.120]   They read for education.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:51.360]   She came back and she said, "No more TV," and in today's society that would mean cut
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:58:00.320]   back on social media and on your cell phone, watching YouTube and wasting your time, and
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.320]   start reading.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.760]   Start reading to learn.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:06.560]   She made her two sons read every single day.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:12.560]   They were only allowed to watch an hour of TV a day and it was specific programming.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:19.080]   Parents need to take a little bit more responsibility over the media that their kids are consuming.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   That's one thing.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.540]   Then make their kids read every day for education.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.520]   That's the second thing.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.840]   We know what happened with Ben Carson.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.720]   He became one of the top neurosurgeons in the world.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:33.040]   His brother, by the way, is doing very well.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.920]   He's an engineer with Boeing.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.380]   He makes a good living and he's very successful.
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:47.280]   This stuff works, so parents need to really limit the consumption of TV and social media
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:53.920]   that the kids are taking in and force them to do a little bit more reading.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:59.280]   One thought on the social media that ties into an earlier thread is if you, if anybody
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:05.600]   listening, if you're like me, where you want to get involved in online discussions, I can
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   read just about anything and want to jump in and argue with somebody.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:14.000]   I made a commitment with the exception I break it once a month or so and then I realized
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.440]   the futility of my ways.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:19.800]   I made a commitment to say, "Instead of being a consumer of this stuff and arguing about
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.400]   it with other consumers, I'm going to be a producer of thought."
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:31.620]   It is not possible to argue in a Facebook comment thread and spend an hour on a political
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.000]   debate to actually change anybody else's mind.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.640]   All you do is make yourself temporarily feel better because you got involved in an argument.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.700]   But if you sit down and go ahead and take the time to do what Tom has done with his
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:48.300]   writing or do what I've done with my podcast and actually create some useful content, there
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:52.720]   you have the opportunity to actually influence people.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:56.480]   That one will actually change your life over time.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.920]   So that's what I'm going to be teaching my kids is let's work on your skills so you can
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.480]   create actual original thought.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.520]   Tom, last question for you.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:12.760]   At the end of your book Rich Kids, you talk about the eight core fears and those eight
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:18.560]   fears are number one, the fear of failure, number two, the fear of success, number three,
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.840]   the fear of rejection, number four, the fear of not being good enough, five, the fear of
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.320]   scarcity, six, the fear of being alone, seven, the fear of losing control and eight, the
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.000]   fear of being different or standing out.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.600]   In your discussions with poor people, which of those fears stood out as being more dominant
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.640]   than others and what would be some strategies that you've learned to work against those
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.960]   to learn to overcome them?
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:51.480]   Yeah, I think the fear of standing out is one of the things that is the worst.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:56.320]   It's the one of the worst fears, in my opinion, because it stops you dead in your tracks.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.680]   And I talk a lot about this and I write a lot about it.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.900]   I call it the herd doctrine.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.860]   We are all as human beings.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:11.440]   We have this, I guess, this evolutionary need to herd and it's built in.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.640]   It's hardwired into all of us.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.280]   There's safety in numbers.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.220]   So what I found that the wealthy people, what the most successful wealthy people, what they
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.240]   did is they separated themselves from the herd somehow.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.560]   Mark Zuckerberg did this.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.840]   The guys from Google did it.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.680]   So did Steve Jobs.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.560]   They put themselves out there and usually they're all alone for some period of time
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.640]   while they're investing their time and trying to be successful.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.120]   And while they're doing that, they are separated from the herd and they're vulnerable.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.520]   And it's a very real fear.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:55.680]   And in fact, there was a candid camera episode where they did this, the prank, where four
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.240]   people entered an elevator and one person was a stranger and four people were candid
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.920]   camera pranksters.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.400]   And they would turn around periodically and eventually the stranger would turn around
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.600]   with them.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:12.240]   There's this need to follow the herd that we need to, this fear of being alone and not
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.440]   being part of the herd that we need to break free of if we want to take ourselves to the
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.440]   next level.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.400]   When you separate yourself from the herd, that's when you grow into a completely different
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.400]   person.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.080]   So what you really want to do is try and find some product or service that's unique, that
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.200]   not everybody else is pursuing.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.440]   And if you believe in it, pursue it, you're going to be on your own for a little while.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.920]   But eventually, if you're persistent, you're going to draw some people into your herd and
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.520]   then you'll create your own herd and have enormous success.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.080]   I forgot I had one more topic and question I wanted to ask you about.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.240]   So this is going to be the actual last question.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.120]   I heard through the grapevine and some mutual acquaintances that when you had written Rich
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.160]   Habits, you had done a lot of work, but then it was just really struggling and you had
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.660]   gotten to a point where you thought about kind of throwing in the towel to some degree
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:09.660]   or another.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:15.320]   And then a few things happened and then all of a sudden some events occurred and it was
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.480]   a large success.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.640]   What was the story behind that when you were facing dark days and it felt like it simply
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.320]   wasn't working?
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.880]   And what happened that changed that for you?
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.560]   Well, you know, this book business, this author business, it's a business first and foremost.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.400]   I mean, it's like you're starting a new business.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.040]   And as in many cases, when you're starting a new business, when it's something that you've
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.960]   never done before, you don't know what you don't know.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.760]   And one of the things that I learned about the author business is that 99 percent of
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.640]   the business is about promoting yourself.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.000]   It's about getting media attention.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.240]   I didn't know that.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.100]   It took me a while to figure that out.
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:03.600]   I thought you put out something great and people will automatically through grassroots
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.400]   or whatever, start buying your books.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.040]   That's not how it happens.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.680]   That's a very rare instance.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:16.160]   So I started to when I realized that somebody pointed it out to me, a famous author.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.480]   And so I started pursuing the media.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.560]   And I honestly, Joshua, I hate pitching the media.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.520]   I love doing media interviews like what we're doing right now.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.600]   I love this.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.320]   This is my sweet spot.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.840]   But I hate pitching them and I hate pursuing it.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:40.160]   So but it's one of these things that in life, when you're pursuing something you're passionate
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.720]   about.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.860]   You know, 75 percent of what you're going to do, you're not going to like.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:51.740]   But it's the 25 percent that really gives you that passion that keeps you in the game.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:58.780]   And so I was almost fed up in 2000 and 11 and 12.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:04.140]   I was really at the point where I was going to quit and stop promoting rich habits.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.500]   And I wasn't going to stop writing books.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.260]   I was just going to not promote it anymore because I didn't know what I was doing and
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.780]   it was too hard.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.180]   But I couldn't stop myself.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.780]   And I kept persisting.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:22.740]   And I think it was because I was that 25 percent just kept me going.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:27.580]   And then all of a sudden it was like a watershed event, you know, three years of nothing and
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:33.620]   then two years of nothing but media attention.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:37.500]   And it all started because of being persistent and tweeting.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.900]   I did it every day like I was brushing my teeth.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.420]   I hated every minute of it.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.620]   I did it an hour every day.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.620]   I tweeted.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.620]   I wrote a book.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:45.620]   I wrote articles.
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.300]   I pitched it to the media through email.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.540]   I call it my daily five.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:51.100]   I did five pitches a day.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.460]   Hated every minute of it.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:57.060]   And then after a couple of years, I got somebody to respond.
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:00.140]   Farnoosh Torabe from Yahoo Finance.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:04.500]   They did an interview with me here in 2013.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.020]   It went viral.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.860]   We had two million hits on the video in 24 hours.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:17.740]   They never had more than 400,000 hits ever on this show.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.260]   And then Dave Ramsey picked it up.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.060]   Next thing I know, I'm on Dave Ramsey's show.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.420]   Next thing I know, CBS is interviewing me.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:24.900]   MSN is interested in me.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.140]   It just went on and on.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.220]   It hasn't stopped.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.100]   But it all happened because I did not quit.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.260]   I did not quit on my dream, even though I wanted to and I came close to it.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.780]   I persisted.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.700]   And this is an important point.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.940]   The people who succeed in life, they never quit.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.540]   They will go bankrupt before they quit.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.700]   And I think that's an important line to draw in the sand.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:55.740]   If you're really dedicated to what you're doing, it means you're willing to risk everything
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:56.740]   for it.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:02.500]   And I'm at that point right now that it doesn't matter what happens with the rest of my life.
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.900]   I'm going to be doing this to the day I die, even if it forces me into bankruptcy, which
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:07.940]   it won't.
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:15.100]   But I'm going to be doing it because I realize this is my passion and that's what I learned
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.100]   from wealthy people.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.060]   They just don't quit on their dreams.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.260]   Lewis: I love it.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.900]   The two books are Rich Habits and Rich Kids.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.740]   The website is richhabits.net.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.940]   You write a tip of the day and then a tip of the week.
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.220]   And so I'd encourage people to consider going over and subscribing there.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.500]   And then when does the third book come out?
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.700]   Fischer: It's going to come out the end of October, early November.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.860]   And it's called Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:50.700]   And in it, I talk about habit change, but also I get more into the rich habits, particularly
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.740]   with respect to the 177 self-made millionaires.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:58.180]   Lewis: Awesome.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:03.260]   Put me on the publicity list if you like when you get ready for pre-orders and we'll try
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.860]   to help you get a little bit of publicity when it's closer to launch date.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.860]   That would be awesome.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:09.860]   Tom, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.340]   I really appreciate the time.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.300]   It's been a joy to talk with you.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.820]   Fischer: Thanks for having me on.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:17.820]   And there were great questions and I really enjoyed the interview, Joshua.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.500]   Lewis: I told you it was a cool story, huh?
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.100]   So now, here's the reading recommendations for you.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.340]   Get Tom's books.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.340]   They're available on Kindle.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.620]   That's how I read them.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.900]   You can get the hardback if you want.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.540]   But these, well, actually, you know what?
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.460]   These are good hardbacks to get.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.460]   The Rich Kids, especially.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.940]   And if you're going to read one of the two, if you're trying to figure out which of these
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.900]   two to read, read Rich Kids.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   That's the one that I preferred more.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:43.140]   But both of them are useful.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.080]   They're just a little bit different.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.900]   So check out the books.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.900]   They're very pithy.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.400]   Rich Kids, especially, extremely pithy.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.340]   And I think that if you're a parent, this is definitely one of those that would be valuable
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:59.820]   for you to read to think about, "How do I guide my children?"
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.260]   Success habits are not an accident.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:07.100]   They are learnable and teachable.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.680]   And if you learn them later in life, don't you think it might be worthwhile to focus
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.700]   on how you learn them and then teach them consciously to your children at a young age?
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.060]   I think it's a worthwhile pursuit.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:26.100]   As we go today, before I kick off the music, I want to recognize the sponsor of the day.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.220]   And the sponsor of today is Audible.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.980]   Now you're very familiar with Audible.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:34.300]   They're everywhere in terms of their marketing footprint.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.300]   And here is no exception.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.680]   I've done an exhaustive study of the audiobook marketplace and Audible is, in my opinion,
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.940]   the best audiobook provider.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:49.620]   If you're interested in details on that, check out episode 219 of the show for a survey of
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.480]   the marketplace.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.540]   But here's one thing I want to emphasize.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:59.100]   And in Tom Corley's book, Rich Habits, he talks about rich habit number three, which
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.500]   is I will engage in self-improvement every day.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.540]   And let me read you an excerpt from the book.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.940]   Successful people engage in the process of self-improvement every day.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:14.140]   They read industry periodicals and technical material specific to their profession or trade.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.980]   They become students of their industry, profession, or trade and keep current with changes that
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:18.980]   occur.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:24.220]   They do not spend excessive amounts of non-work time watching television or surfing the internet.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.380]   Successful people read for self-improvement.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.220]   They are perpetual students.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:32.820]   Each day, they devote blocks of time to better themselves by studying subject matter that
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:37.580]   will improve them in some way and better enable them to perform their jobs.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:41.420]   Time is too valuable to be wasted on matters with no tangible value.
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.940]   They coordinate their goals with self-improvement and set specific goals.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.500]   This may involve obtaining an additional license, a degree, or developing a new niche for their
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.500]   business.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:56.040]   They are continuously engaged in some constructive project to increase their skill sets, promote
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:02.420]   their business or careers, keep their minds sharp, or expand their business prospects.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:05.780]   Unsuccessful people are not students of their industry, profession, or trade.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.540]   They do not routinely follow their industry.
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:11.140]   They do not regularly read industry periodicals.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:16.300]   They would rather spend hours each day watching television or engaged in junk reading.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:22.040]   They use rationalization to justify their negligence in improving themselves.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.940]   It involves engaging in some activity every day that will improve your mind and expand
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:31.140]   your knowledge to better your career.
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:36.340]   This is one of the core habits of wealth and success, and it's a habit that I believe that
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:42.960]   throughout our entire lifetimes, we need to continue to implement and develop and perfect.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:50.260]   But you need a strategy because there is so much material that you need to learn and study,
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.820]   and it's impossible to learn and read and consume it all.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:54.820]   So we need a strategy.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.300]   Let's say that you're going to set aside 30 minutes a day for reading.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.340]   Well, 30 minutes a day for reading comes out to three hours a week.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.340]   That's pretty good.
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:05.260]   You could read, book a week at that rate, depending on your reading speed, book every
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.860]   week or two weeks.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:10.820]   But is that the best use of that 30 minutes of focused self-development time?
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.540]   It might be.
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:17.160]   But remember that there are many materials that you should keep current on that are simply
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:23.660]   not available in an audio format, and so you'll want to choose those materials to consume
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.960]   during that morning time.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.780]   That would be things like your industry trade journals, your industry publications, keeping
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:36.140]   current on the latest research that's being published in your industry.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.780]   Now some of that might be available in an audio format.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:40.660]   There might be an industry podcast.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:45.860]   If there's not, you should have started one by now.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:50.140]   If there is, you might be able to consume it in the industry podcast format.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.660]   However, that's going to be good material for reading.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.660]   If you're pursuing an additional license or degree, that's going to be good material for
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:56.660]   reading.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:01.180]   So take some of the books that you would ordinarily read and move them over to audiobooks.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:05.060]   Now unfortunately, I wish that Rich Habits and Rich Kids were available in an audiobook
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:06.220]   format, but they're not.
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.500]   So Tom Corley, what are you doing?
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.700]   Get your audiobooks published.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.100]   I'm sure there's some story to it for the reason that they're not there.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.180]   If they aren't, then those would be excellent books.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:19.580]   But audiobook, Audible recommendation of the day today is get the book The Richest
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.340]   Man in Babylon in audiobook format.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.740]   And this is a good one to own.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.580]   The other book that Tom mentioned, The Greatest Salesman in the World, is also excellent.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.620]   I've listened to the audiobook version of that, but it's not available on Audible.
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.860]   You might be able to find it somewhere else.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.360]   Believe I listened to it years ago from the library.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.020]   And when I was an initial sales—no, I own it.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.340]   I have it somewhere in my files.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.340]   So I bought it at some point.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.820]   It's just not available now.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:48.100]   When I was early in my sales career with Northwestern Mutual, I would listen to that book over and
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.260]   over and over again.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.900]   And if you've ever heard the book, you'd know why.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:54.860]   If you're a salesperson, it's very encouraging and motivating.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.580]   But get the book The Richest Man in Babylon.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.580]   And this is a good one to buy.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.060]   Pick a narrator that you like.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:03.300]   There are about four different narrators available on Audible.
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.060]   Pick a narrator whose voice you like and whose style you enjoy.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:12.220]   And then use it and burn CDs for all the young people in your life.
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.020]   The Richest Man in Babylon is a fable.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:15.020]   It's a parable.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.020]   It's not a fable.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:17.060]   It's a parable.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.380]   And it's a story that's very digestible.
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.740]   Now, it's a bit old-fashioned in style.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.440]   I personally enjoy that.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.740]   You might run across people who don't.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:29.300]   So that's why we need newer versions of this type of literature.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:33.980]   But I think this is a good one to give to people to start them off with personal finance.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:38.280]   So buy a copy of The Richest Man in Babylon with your Audible subscription.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.380]   Burn it on a CD and share that with the young people in your life.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.980]   And hopefully, you'll be able to set them on the right path.

[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.900]   I appreciate your time and attention.
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:22.260]   I hope this content was interesting to you.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:28.980]   As we go, I'm going to again point your attention to Tom's story.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:33.700]   Recognize that there's nothing that he did that I can't do and there's nothing that he
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:40.560]   did that you can't do and there's nothing that he's doing now that you and I can't do.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.540]   You can interview all the rich people in your life and you should.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.700]   Take some of your education budget which you have established in your budget and use it
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.300]   on taking rich people out to lunch.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:54.580]   Take anybody out to lunch that you admire for some reason.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:59.980]   Financial riches are one component of a life of success but there are many other components.
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:04.540]   If there's somebody that you admire how they treat other people or you admire their heart
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:08.020]   and their generous attitude or you admire their relationship with their spouse or you
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:12.420]   admire for their parenting ability or you admire for their academic accomplishment and
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:16.380]   achievements or you admire for their place of respect in the community or you admire
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:20.320]   for their spiritual vitality and insight, it doesn't matter.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.300]   If there's somebody that you admire, invite them out for lunch.
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:28.260]   Just tell them I'm interested in asking you some questions and learning about this.
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:33.900]   A couple appetizers, a couple meals, a couple of drinks and maybe some dessert, always a
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.780]   good idea to stretch those meetings as long as you can reasonably do it to get as much
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.700]   out of a person as you can.
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:43.600]   It's a good use of your education dollars and essentially that's what Tom Corley did.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.300]   Take good notes and you might find yourself writing a book.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.000]   You might find yourself writing a book which would then expand your career, get you featured
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.020]   all around in the world, can allow you to be an encouragement and help to many other
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.460]   people.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.540]   So consider copying him.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:04.820]   The other thing is read Rich Kids and look at Tom's vision for his life as a grandfather.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:08.300]   That vision is powerful, a lot more powerful than this idea of I'm going to drop out of
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:12.820]   life at 65 and sit around and be a hermit and play shuffleboard in Florida.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.820]   Don't do that.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.300]   Thank you all so much for listening.
