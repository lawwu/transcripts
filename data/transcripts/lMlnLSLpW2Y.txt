[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.980]   Cannabis is a unique instance in which nowadays
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.780]   we are hearing, yes, it's becoming legal
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.620]   in a number of areas.
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.840]   And we talked earlier about why that's probably a good thing
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.780]   in most circumstances, but that we aren't just hearing
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.420]   that cannabis is safe, or it's not just being implied
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.340]   that cannabis is safer, but many more people are talking
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.060]   about the positive effects of cannabis
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.580]   without a lot of discussion
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580]   about the negative effects of cannabis.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.840]   And I realize that saying this is going to upset
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.660]   some people out there because I know that there are a number
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.300]   of people who fought very hard for the legalization process,
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.100]   and I want to acknowledge that.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.940]   I also want to acknowledge the many known positive effects
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.740]   of cannabis in adults with very occasional use,
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.500]   provided it is delivered safely
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.780]   and in the safe context and setting and with legality.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.260]   That is entirely distinct from the issue
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.700]   of whether or not cannabis is safe
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.920]   for the developing brain and body.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.120]   Again, I'm not demonizing anybody for using cannabis,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.020]   but I want to make the point very simply and very directly.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.520]   It is far and away a different circumstance for the brain,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.140]   for an individual to be 25 years or older
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.460]   and using cannabis in whatever form,
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.980]   occasionally, or maybe even frequently,
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.980]   than it is for a young person, age 14 to 25,
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.860]   to be using cannabis, either by smoking or vaping,
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.500]   or by edible or any other form on the brain and body.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   It's absolutely clear that the brain continues to develop
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.220]   at least until age 25 and that a huge number of systems
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.540]   related to mood regulation, so-called executive function,
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.700]   the ability to organize one's thoughts, plan,
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.740]   and execute plans,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.300]   essentially to become a functional human being, right?
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.740]   That's one portion of becoming a functional human being,
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.860]   but certainly an essential one.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.260]   All of that relies on the fine-tuning
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.220]   of this neural circuitry that we've been talking about
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.900]   up until now.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.540]   And it's abundantly clear that cannabis and THC
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.540]   in particular, dramatically disrupt those processes.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.180]   So if this isn't clear enough just from my statements,
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.220]   I'd like to point to a particular paper.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.860]   This is one of the more impactful papers
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.900]   in this area in recent years.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   This is a paper published in "Lancet Psychiatry" in 2022.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.940]   Title is "Association of Cannabis Potency
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.540]   with Mental Ill Health and Addiction, a Systematic Review."
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.180]   There are a number of very important points
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.980]   in this very fine paper.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.460]   "Lancet Psychiatry" is one of the premier
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.860]   medical journals out there,
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.660]   and they evaluated a huge number of studies.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.660]   They actually looked at more than 4,000 studies.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.780]   They selected the ones that were only the most rigorous
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.700]   in terms of study design and analysis
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.860]   and rigor of conclusions.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.660]   And they looked at how early use of cannabis
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.100]   impacted later probability of development of psychosis
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.180]   and other psychiatric conditions.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.820]   And the takeaways from this study are very clear.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.060]   First of all, chronic cannabis use,
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.540]   so more than twice per week,
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.220]   has consistently been associated
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.580]   with mental health disorders.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.180]   I'm pulling some phrases directly from the paper.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.340]   Heavy cannabis use,
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.860]   meaning cannabis use more frequent than twice per week,
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.580]   has been associated with four times
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.420]   the risk of psychosis later in life.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.940]   In particular, schizophrenia and bipolar-like episodes.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.260]   Now, we've done an episode on bipolar disorder,
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.900]   so-called bipolar depression.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.460]   We have not yet done one on schizophrenia,
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.020]   but both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.100]   have a very, very strong genetic component.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.980]   There's a 30, three, zero,
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.820]   30 times greater likelihood that you'll have bipolar disorder
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.660]   if you have a first relative who has bipolar disorder.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.260]   And then it's also the case that using cannabis,
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.020]   especially during adolescence and the teen years
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.700]   and up until age 25,
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.020]   create a four times greater risk of psychosis
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.460]   for those that have a predisposition to bipolar disorder
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.100]   and/or schizophrenia.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.900]   Now, I don't hear very much about this in the media.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300]   This paper got some attention
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.020]   and then it sort of got swept away.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.700]   I don't think that was an intentional sweeping way.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.020]   There's just a lot of events in the world, as you well know.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.420]   But I think it's a particularly important set of findings
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.180]   because obviously in looking at so many studies,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540]   it distills out the strongest findings that are out there
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.820]   and really pulls the consistent messages
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.940]   that are arriving from all these different studies.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.220]   And as they point out, and again, I'm paraphrasing here,
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.820]   this is the first systematic review
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.060]   of the association of cannabis potency.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.540]   And all of the data point to a very clear conclusion,
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.540]   which is the more potent the THC concentration,
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.900]   the higher probability of developing psychosis
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.420]   or a major depressive episode
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.860]   or a major anxiety disorder later in life.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.040]   That should be of particular concern because we know,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.740]   we are absolutely clear about the fact that
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.980]   with the advent of all these new strains of cannabis
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.780]   and with the engineering and availability of cannabis
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.300]   at much higher potency, meaning THC potency,
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.200]   the risk of psychosis is going up and up
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.740]   and is likely to continue going up
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.340]   unless something is done to reduce
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.340]   the frequency of cannabis use to zero, ideally,
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.420]   or to very low frequency, very low potency
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.860]   in adolescents and teens and people age 25 or younger.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.120]   I know a lot of people don't want to hear this message
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.420]   because first of all, it's alarming.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.040]   And second of all, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.380]   the statistics tell us that the greatest number of people
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.740]   that are starting to use cannabis
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.480]   are in the age bracket of 16 to 24.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.600]   Many of them are functional in other areas of life.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.940]   They are students, they are employed, et cetera.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.060]   But when you couple that with the fact
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.780]   that the most frequent adopters of cannabis use
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.500]   are in this age bracket of 16 to 24,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.860]   they're twice as likely to use as other individuals
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.720]   or to start using cannabis as are other individuals,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.740]   plus the general perception out there
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.820]   because of the way that cannabis is discussed in the media
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.020]   and by sports figures and by celebrities
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.460]   and by politicians, et cetera,
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.140]   that it's not as bad as alcohol and maybe not that bad
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.820]   and maybe even has health benefits,
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.220]   then you're essentially setting up a system
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.260]   where young people are far more likely
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.920]   to adopt and continue cannabis use
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.880]   without realizing these serious health consequences
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.380]   that await them later.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.960]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.380]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.980]   (upbeat music)
