[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   As Christian hedonists, we're not unfamiliar with the pain of depression.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.100]   And we get a lot of questions in the inbox about how to work through those unavoidable
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.960]   times in life when depression hits.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.600]   There's often a physical and a medical side to depression, but there's also a spiritual
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.520]   side to these seasons too.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.000]   And to that question comes an email from one female listener.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.520]   "Pastor John, what scripture passages do you return to when you are suffering from depression?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.120]   I'm suffering from depression pretty bad at the moment, and I need some help from scripture.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.800]   Can you help me?"
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.320]   This is the central question for her to ask, namely, "Where shall I turn in scripture,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.880]   in God's Word?"
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.440]   This is what God said we should listen to, His Word.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.680]   I don't want to be naive here.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:09.040]   To be sure, there are many dimensions to depression, from genetic to dietary to exercise to trauma
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.880]   to demonic harassment to relational stress to financial burdens to weather conditions
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.480]   to sinful entanglements to sleeplessness and on and on.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.360]   I don't want to give the impression that I am oversimplifying the complexities of what
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.080]   might trigger a season of darkness or depression.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.320]   Nevertheless, I say it again, under and over and through all these issues that may need
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   to be addressed, and I would encourage her to address all of them that are relevant.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.600]   The key question is, "What has God said to me?"
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.960]   That is, what does the scripture say?
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.320]   And the reason this is so key is that the Bible says faith comes by hearing, and hearing
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.720]   by the Word of Christ.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.680]   Depression regularly involves a weakening of our faith and our hope, and God is clear
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.680]   that reawakening of faith, reawakening of hope, will not come if we're not hearing the
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.920]   Word of God.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.880]   The scriptures do not present themselves as an automatic guarantee of emotional turnaround,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.120]   because the scriptures themselves describe people who hear the Word of God and do not
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.600]   emotionally turn around, like the parable of the soils or 1 Corinthians 15.2, "You
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.000]   believed in vain," and so on.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.240]   The scriptures aren't naive that they are the quick and easy panacea for every emotional
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.960]   blankness.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.800]   But the point is, without the scriptures, there's no hope of a Christ-exalting turnaround
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.320]   of our emotions.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:09.280]   Depression might turn us around emotionally, but by itself, by itself, without the Word
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.520]   of God, won't put us on a right footing with Jesus Christ.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:23.080]   So it may feel good, but may not have done you any long-term good without the Word of
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   God.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.600]   So again, yes, yes, I wish I knew her name.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   Yes, thank you.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.840]   I would have posed the absolutely right question without being naive about the complexities
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.960]   of how difficult and dark and multi-causal depression can be.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:51.400]   So let me answer by giving five kinds of texts that she might turn to and that I turn to.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:00.160]   Number one, take note of the scriptures that speak about the necessity of waiting for God.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.880]   Psalm 40, "I waited patiently for the Lord."
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.400]   It doesn't say how longâ€”days, weeks, months.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.200]   "I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.240]   He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.440]   He drew me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   a rock."
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.760]   So the season of in the pit and in the bog and the assignment for us believers in those
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.200]   seasons is wait patiently for the Lord.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.680]   Or Psalm 30, verse 5, "Weeping may carry for the night.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.760]   Joy comes with the morning."
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.480]   And that's not literally intended like, "Oh, you only get one day of weeping and then you
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.400]   get another day of joy."
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   That's not the point because this command might be read at 1159 p.m.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.760]   Like, "Here, you get one minute of weeping and then 24 hours."
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.360]   The point is there are seasons and they're going to be followed for the believer with
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360]   joy.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.920]   Or Psalm 56, 8, "You have kept count of my tossings.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.360]   Put my tears in your bottle.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.100]   Are they not in your book?"
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.000]   So the point on this first group is that the Bible does not present our walk with God as
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.120]   uninterrupted brightness.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.780]   We feed in green pastures, yes, and we walk through the valley of death, yes.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:40.560]   We experience the shining of His face and we experience the hiding of His face.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.460]   So in the scriptural prescription, what we find is that when His face is hidden, we are
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.220]   to wait and pray.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.220]   That's the first group.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.420]   Second group of texts for her to look at with me.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:03.700]   Turn to passages that show how to experience gutsy guilt.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.720]   Love this phrase.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:13.620]   And I'm thinking of Micah 7, verses 8 and 9, where it describes in a most phenomenal
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:23.980]   way how sinful people like us under the darkness of God are to be gutsy and in our justified
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.000]   standing as we deal with God.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Listen to these words.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.080]   This is Micah 7, 8, "Rejoice not over me, O my enemy.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.780]   When I fall, I shall rise.
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:43.540]   When I sit in darkness," now that's what I would call depression, "When I sit in darkness,
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.420]   the Lord will be a light to me.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.460]   I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against Him."
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.460]   And all of us have sinned.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.900]   I'm not saying every darkness is a specific punishment for sin.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.900]   I'm just saying we've all sinned and therefore there's no point in trying to play goody-goody
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.420]   while we're under the darkness like, "Oh, he's treating me worse than I deserve."
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.420]   No, no.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:15.100]   We've all sinned and it says, "I have sinned against Him until He pleads my cause and executes
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.300]   judgment for me."
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.700]   Not against me, for me.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   "He will bring me out to the light."
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.620]   So that's what we say when we're in the darkness.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.500]   Last phrase, "I shall look upon His vindication."
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.100]   That's an amazing and wonderful passage.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.300]   There is nothing sentimental or naive about it.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.700]   It is utterly realistic in dealing with our own sin and God's grace.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.020]   This is the way a justified sinner talks.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.860]   We do not despair and we do not feel presumptuous.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:59.540]   Our confidence is in God and His vindication, which leads now to a third group where seeing
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.380]   that vindication worked out by God in history is absolutely crucial.
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.220]   This may be the most important group of text to look at.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:16.140]   So fix your attention, especially on the passages that describe the stunning work of Christ
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:23.980]   on the cross, outside yourself, to provide your vindication as a justified sinner before
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.220]   an all-holy, all-loving God.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:33.700]   For example, Romans 5, 6, "While we were still weak at the right time, Christ died
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.140]   for the ungodly.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.020]   For one will scarcely die for a righteous person, though perhaps for a good person one
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.500]   might dare to die."
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:50.340]   And here it is, verse 8, "But God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners,
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.540]   Christ died for us."
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.420]   Oh, look to that text again and again.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:02.060]   Or Romans 8, 3, "God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do, by sending
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.220]   His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin."
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.020]   Here's what He did.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:15.000]   He condemned sin in the flesh, that is, in the flesh of His own Son, not your flesh.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.460]   Or Galatians 3, 13, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.980]   curse for us."
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.700]   Oh, amazing promise.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:35.420]   Or 1 Peter 2, 24, "He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.080]   die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.720]   By His wounds you have been healed.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.340]   For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned."
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.940]   So the great healing is, you were headlong heading for the cliff of destruction, and
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:59.500]   the shepherd dying reaches out to you and pulls you back, and it says, "You have now
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.940]   returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls."
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.100]   Let it sink in.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.300]   My soul has a shepherd.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.400]   My soul has an overseer.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.860]   And there's so many more texts like that.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.580]   2 Corinthians 5, 22; Philippians 3, 12; Philippians 1, 6; Isaiah 53, 4-6.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.660]   That's the third group of texts to look at.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:27.540]   And the fourth group is, "Recite scriptures of thanksgiving and praise, even though you
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.060]   do not feel them."
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:37.860]   Here's one example, Psalm 86, 8-13, "You are great, O God, and do wondrous things.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.620]   You alone are God.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.620]   Teach me Your way, O Lord, that I may walk in Your truth.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.540]   Unite my heart to fear Your name.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:52.300]   I give thanks to You, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify Your name
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.380]   forever, for great is Your steadfast love toward me.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.260]   You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol."
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.180]   Psalm 86.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:10.120]   Now, if you are honest with God, and with yourself, and with others, about the absence
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:18.060]   of your feelings, then the recitation of these thanks are not hypocrisy.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:27.420]   They are expressions of longing, and a belief that God alone is worthy of thanks and praise.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.780]   Here's what Richard Baxter says about what I'm asking you to do.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.300]   This is a pastor from the 1600s.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:40.700]   "Resolve to spend most of your time in thanksgiving and praising God.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.980]   If you cannot do it with the joy that you should, yet do it as you can.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:53.160]   You have not the power of your comforts, but have you no power over your tongues.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.140]   Say not that you are unfit for thanks and praises, unless you have a praising heart
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.540]   and were the children of God.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:11.340]   For every man, good and bad, is bound to praise God and to be thankful for all that he hath
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:18.600]   received, and to do it as well as he can, rather than leave it undone.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:26.200]   Doing it as you can is the way to be able to do it better.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.060]   Thanksgiving stirreth up thankfulness in the heart."
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.940]   It doesn't have to be hypocrisy, in other words, for you to read the Scriptures and
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:42.380]   say them back to God about thanks and praise, all the while knowing your heart is aching
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.500]   to feel them and doesn't yet.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.780]   Here's the last group of texts.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:56.100]   "Turn to texts that cry out to God for the restoration of life and joy."
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.460]   Psalm 51.12.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.700]   "Restore to me.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.300]   The joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit."
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.860]   Psalm 85.6.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:13.380]   "Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?"
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:22.380]   And the reason for turning to texts like these is not only that they are prayers which God
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:30.620]   may be pleased to answer soon by restoring your joy, they are also evidences that the
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:38.620]   seed of joy in God is still alive in your soul.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.180]   Let me close with this, and this is so crucial, because you may feelâ€”I don't even know
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:50.980]   if I'm a Christian, because I feel so blankâ€”the marks of that seed, there are four things
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.540]   that characterize that seed of joy that is still alive in you.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.580]   See if these are there.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:05.820]   Number one, you can still see objectively that God is the supreme treasure of the universe,
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.400]   even if your feelings about Him are very flat.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:18.420]   Number two, you can confess that objective sight of God with your lips, that God is supremely
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.420]   valuable.
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:29.260]   And three, you can cry out for the restoration of true joy, and that very cry is the seed
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.820]   sown by the taste of the joy.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:41.060]   And four, you can refuse to turn away from God and embrace idols.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:49.660]   So may the Lord use those five kinds of Scripture to give you patience and bring you through
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.340]   the season of darkness.

[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.060]   Well, what role does our faith play when we are praying for the salvation of others?
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.300]   It's an important question related to our prayer lives, and the question about our own
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.660]   faith and our prayer lives comes from a listener.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.660]   Really good question.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.300]   We're going to tackle that one next time on Wednesday when we return.
