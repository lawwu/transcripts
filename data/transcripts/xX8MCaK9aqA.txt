[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   procrastination is not a problem with doing the work.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.600]   Procrastination is a problem with starting the work. Because
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.800]   usually once you've gotten started with something, it's
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.680]   generally easy enough to keep on going. You know, Newton's first
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.480]   law, the law of inertia, it takes energy to get the flywheel
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.080]   going. But once it's going, it's like, oh, you know, you're into
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.600]   the swing of things, you're enjoying the thing that you're
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.800]   doing, you're getting energy from it. And it's, it's usually
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.080]   not so bad. Does that broadly vibe with your experience of
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.480]   kind of procrastinating as well?
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920]   Yeah, I think it's probably two part, it's hard to get started.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.120]   And then it's hard to avoid the shiny objects that pop in front
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.480]   of you like an email or a news, some alert or something. So I
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.560]   think it's those those two are big for me.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.240]   Yes, exactly. Yeah. So the way I think of them is I separate out
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.480]   procrastination, which is the getting started problem from
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.360]   distraction, which is the how do I focus once I've already gotten
