[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.580]   in the right direction.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.720]   Berean Community Church, this is another one of those bonus episodes where the surpassing
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.680]   value crosses over with BCC much like the bonus episode I did with Pastor Peter Kim
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.100]   on the Ravi Zacharias scandal.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.700]   It's sort of like that, but this one is going to be involving the rest of the elders and
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.820]   pastors as well.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.240]   Given our church's anniversary is coming up in a couple days and with the purchase of
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.000]   our new building, I thought it would be appropriate to revisit our origins.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.920]   We all know the importance of studying history, but nonetheless I want to read to you some
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.500]   various quotes before we get into this.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.240]   Marcus Garvey said it like this, "A people without the knowledge of their past history,
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.820]   origin and culture is like a tree without roots."
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.720]   "A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   tree without roots."
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.600]   Robert Heinlein said something similar, he said this, "A generation which ignores history
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.280]   has no past and no future."
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.440]   "A generation which ignores history has no past and no future."
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   Most importantly, Deuteronomy 5.15 states, "And you shall remember that you were a slave
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.960]   in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.200]   and an outstretched arm.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.480]   Therefore the Lord your God commanded you to celebrate the Sabbath day."
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.680]   I think you get my point.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.080]   As God has been so gracious to Beroean Community Church, we could easily lose sight of His
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.200]   graciousness and take what He has given us for granted if we forget where we came from.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.160]   And I know people have heard various stories about how the church came to be from various
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.000]   sources but we're adding new people all the time and I thought it might also be good if
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.280]   we could get some linear telling of a truncated version.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.420]   So with that I've asked the other leaders to carve out some time so we could accomplish
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.200]   just that.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:05.280]   And although we are called by God to honor faithful leaders as stated in 1 Thessalonians
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   5, 12-13, my goal here is to highlight the God who works through flawed men.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.640]   With that said, I hope this episode serves to be edifying.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.240]   Be warned though, this is a long-form podcast episode.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.680]   The substance of the episode is about an hour and 45 minutes.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   So with that, I hope you are edified and I hope you enjoy.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.760]   Burien Community Church, as promised, this is the History of Burien Community Church
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.480]   episode.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.880]   I've gathered all the elders and pastors, the entire leadership, all seven of us for
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   this episode.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   I'm going to ask everyone to just kind of introduce themselves starting from my left
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.560]   so that as we're talking you guys could know which voice is who for the people who don't
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.000]   know the leaders maybe as well as others, you can connect the voices.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.040]   And so starting from my left, Pastor Peter, if you could say hi.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   Hello.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   This is Pastor Peter Kim.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.240]   This is Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   This is Elder Phillip.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   Pastor Nathan.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   Hey, it's Pastor Mark.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.680]   Hey guys, it's Elder Joe.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   All right.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:27.040]   So I want to start off, since this is a history episode, I think it might be prudent to kind
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.920]   of go in chronological order.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.720]   And I think a fact that most people might not know is that our senior pastor, Pastor
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.400]   Peter Kim, actually wasn't the first member.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.600]   It was actually Elder Joe at the time.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.960]   And so Elder Joe, if you can kind of tell us about that.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.580]   How old were you when the church started?
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.440]   Maybe give us a little bit before that because I know a little bit and that helps to kind
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.160]   of bring into clarity the entire history of Burien Community Church.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.080]   So kind of, if you can talk about that a little bit.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.040]   Well, I was at the church obviously before it started.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.220]   The church officially started in 1997, which would put me at my sophomore year in college.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.120]   So I was pretty young back then, but prior to Burien officially launching, our church,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.560]   for those of you who may not know, was named Harvest Community Church.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.280]   And I remember a meeting that we had back then where we sat in our old church building
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.880]   fellowship hall and we were discussing what our name should be.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.680]   The interesting thing is we had some say into naming our church back then.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.600]   And ultimately it came out where it was Harvest Community Church.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.280]   And that retained for probably a year.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.720]   And then Pastor Peter came in and we started really thinking through why we would want
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   a name change and align with more of the philosophy.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.320]   So after the name change, when did Pastor Peter come in?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.720]   So Pastor Peter was one of the pastors that initiated that name change.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.240]   So he was already there by that time.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.480]   You mentioned you were a sophomore in college, so you were about 20?
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.360]   Yeah, approximately about 20 years old and very mature church, very mature.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.200]   But that wasn't the first time you met Pastor Peter though.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:39.440]   No, so I've known Pastor Peter since, interestingly enough, my son is 13 now, a seventh grader.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.920]   And that's around the time where I met Pastor Peter.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.080]   He came to the Korean church that I was part of and that's where I first met him.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.920]   He was coming in as a high school pastor, I believe.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   That was Irvine Baptist?
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   Yes, it was.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   Okay.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.240]   And that's Irvine Baptist is over here near Jeffrey and Walnut.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   It's still there.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   It's still there.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.400]   Pastor, so can you tell us a little bit about that, about when you come into Harvest Community
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.640]   Church at the time, what were the circumstances that led to you coming there?
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.440]   What were you doing before?
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:18.080]   Well, I was a youth pastor at Irvine Baptist where Elder Joe was a student and then I was
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.920]   also his older sister's youth pastor.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.480]   And then, so I was there probably about five years and I was a youth pastor for one year
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.040]   and then I was a college and EM pastor for the four years after that.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.440]   And then there was a lot of problems happening in the Korean side and then my former youth
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.600]   pastor asked me to come and join him at a church in Gardena.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.300]   And so I actually went there for a year and then that church ended up falling apart.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:52.160]   And then, so I was in between churches and so I heard that the former EM pastor came
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.680]   in after I left and he's the one who got permission, got it inaugurated, registered and all that.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.560]   But then two to three months after it started, he ended up leaving.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:10.160]   And so the official launch of the church happened 1997, I think in January or something.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.600]   And then they had the inauguration service in April of 1997, which I was supposed to
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.040]   come and participate in but I couldn't because my first son was born on that same day.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.220]   And then I didn't officially join the church I think until August of that year.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.680]   So it was already like they were physically meeting, again, you know, within that church
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.280]   for about six months or so before I came.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.000]   So that's kind of how it started and I came in because the guy who got it inaugurated
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.440]   ended up taking off.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.440]   - Oh, okay.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440]   - Yeah.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.600]   - So, you know, it's funny here because as I'm kind of going through a timeline of events,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.960]   it's January of 1997 and the church's name is Harvest Community Church.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:03.840]   And then, you know, the inauguration event is April 17th of 1997.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   - 12th.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.960]   - April 12th, I'm sorry, April 12th of 1997.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.060]   And it's still obviously Harvest Community Church at that time.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.520]   If you're picking up on this, the name of our church is not Harvest Community Church.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.600]   So if you kind of take us through that as well, Pastor Peter, you come in about August
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.840]   of '97, take us through the events and up until the name change.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   - Well, name change actually didn't happen until maybe about a year and a half after
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   I came in.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.200]   And to be honest, I never liked the name.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.080]   And the reason why was because it was so generic, there's so many Harvest Churches.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.920]   And then what actually kind of was the catalyst to change the name was because there was another
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.680]   church, EM Ministry, that came out of Bethel, and they came out with 180 people.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.160]   And so they were named First Harvest Church.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.760]   And so our church was constantly being, thinking that that was the church, you know, I would
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.320]   meet people and say, you know, I go to Harvest Community Churches.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.560]   And then they would say, oh, yeah, I know your pastor, Pastor Rick, right, so actually
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.000]   I'm the pastor.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.200]   And then so I would always have to re-explain that we're not that church, because that church
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.340]   was much bigger at that time.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.680]   And this is when our church was like 30 or less with, you know, half high school students,
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.680]   half college students.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.800]   So no one knew who we were.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:31.760]   And then to be honest, the name that I actually wanted was Axe, because that was a name that
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.400]   I was using for our homeless ministry, Alliance of Christians Training for Service was the
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   acronym for Axe.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.640]   In fact, my Costco card still has Axe on it.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.320]   But Berean Community Church was something that we collectively, at least the people
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.920]   who were in leadership at that time, wanted, because it kind of represented our church
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.560]   vision, the name wise.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.000]   So that's how that happened.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Yeah, well, so after the church is inaugurated in April, and then August, you come on board.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.080]   I know this pastor kind of left, and then you become the sole pastor.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.960]   Can you kind of walk us through that?
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   How did that happen?
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:21.000]   Yeah, that's a very complicated story, because he's somebody that I knew, and he was the
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.920]   former EM pastor before I came.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.480]   And he's the guy who invited me to come to Irvine Baptist to begin with.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.880]   He's actually Luke King's uncle.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.720]   And so I came in, he actually wanted to work together for a while at Irvine Baptist.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.600]   But again, I was in between churches at that time, and I was kind of wrestling with, you
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.400]   know, if I wanted to continue in ministry, to be honest.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.060]   And I actually had friends who were asking me to plant a church, but I wasn't in a state
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.200]   of mind wanting to plant a church.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:58.160]   So when I heard he left, I think Joe was the one who called me saying that, you know, there's
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.680]   nobody here, you know, like if you're in between church, you know, would you come?
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.840]   And so I came really to kind of help, not necessarily to plant the church.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.960]   The church was already planted, like technically.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.600]   And so I just came to help, because these are guys that I knew since they were a youth
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.520]   group, and I just didn't want that group to fall apart.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.800]   I was afraid that they were going to fall apart and they were going to leave the church.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.560]   So I didn't really come for the church plant.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.720]   I came to continue the work that I was doing with them, because I was concerned about them.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.240]   - So when you come in August, who are the pastors there?
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.680]   - So technically there wasn't a pastor, because he left.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.440]   And then the youth pastor at that time, a guy named Jay Kim, he kind of stepped in,
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.100]   was preaching on Sunday, but there was no pastor.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.400]   But basically he was left vacant for probably three or four months before I came.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.720]   - So initially, you're coming in thinking you're going to help out, and you come in
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.600]   and all of a sudden, you're kind of like the last man standing, but you're also the new
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   guy.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600]   Is that kind of...
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.960]   - I am the new guy, because I just came in, but I'm also the old guy, because everybody
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   there were guys that I ministered to when they were in high school and college.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.480]   So I was actually their pastor before I left.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.520]   So I was just gone for a year.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.640]   - So when you came in during that time, I know Elder Joe was there.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.080]   Was there anyone else at church that was there at the time?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.120]   - Tonya was a freshman.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.040]   She was not a believer, but she was there.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.160]   And then the others were in high school, so they weren't part of our group yet.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.080]   They were still in high school.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.340]   They were junior in high school when I came.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.480]   So the guys who are turning 40 now were 16 at that time.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.440]   - So in August, what are you thinking at this point?
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.320]   Because I mean, you're coming into a situation...
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:55.400]   - I came in because I felt like my Korean was good enough that I could have a good relationship
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.320]   with the Korean adults, and really to protect the group and protect the...
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.440]   I mean, at that time, they were kids.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.360]   And I wasn't sure exactly if I was going to endure in ministry.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.000]   And so if I am restored, my thought was I need to be restored here.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.080]   Because even after I left, I could never...
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.760]   I was always thinking about this church and the guys who were there.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.840]   So if I was at another church, obviously I couldn't come, but I was doing telemarketing
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.000]   at that time, just to pay bills.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.200]   - So you weren't getting a full-time salary at the time?
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   - No.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.400]   So I had a church that wanted me there, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to be.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.240]   That's why I was doing telemarketing, just to kind of make the ends meet, which I was
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   pretty miserable.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.640]   It was probably all the jobs I had, I hated that job the most.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.800]   Anyway, but it was during that time that I got contacted by them.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.080]   But interestingly enough, the Korean side also called me at the same time, asked me
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:03.040]   to come and basically pull that ministry away, shut down the church and start the EM.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.320]   And I told them I couldn't do that.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.720]   And that's what eventually led to us having to leave that building.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.520]   So walk us through the first couple of years when you come on board in August.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.240]   I mean, you mentioned leaving the building, and I know the details about that, but walk
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.320]   us through what that was like and what happened.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.360]   - Well, not to rehash everything, there's a lot that happened, even with the pastors.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.900]   After I came back, the guy who left actually ended up rejoining us, because he's always
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.800]   wanted to work together, but once he found out that I came back, he actually came back
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   to support work.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.720]   And then Pastor Jay, at that time he was a pastor, he's not a pastor anymore.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.920]   So the three of us were actually working together.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.680]   So we were at the church for about a year.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:54.480]   And then the church went from 20 to, I think at one point 70, within the first year.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.040]   So everybody at CCM and a lot of people in KCM was coming, mainly because our praise
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.400]   team was really good.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.000]   And so they came for the praise, and then at the end of the year, we decided we need
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.500]   to do membership.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.240]   And at that time, our membership was like six months long.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:17.160]   So basically, they would have service, go have lunch, come back, and then about an hour
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   and a half for six months.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.320]   And that thinned out the church.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   We went from 1520 to 7080, back to maybe about 2025, after the membership happened.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.640]   Yeah, so it was really exciting.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.040]   So you're saying we should go from eight weeks to six months.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   Okay, got that.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   Got that.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.320]   Okay, well, we'll investigate that, Pastor Peter.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.880]   But anyway, what led to us leaving was the senior pastor, interim pastor for the Korean
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.080]   side, our visions didn't line up.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.240]   He wanted us to be more Korean, he wanted us to be more charismatic, and there's a lot
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   of other stuff happened.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.080]   But at the end, he didn't feel like we fit in.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:03.640]   And so how many years was at that period where you are just kind of naturally detached?
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   From the Korean side?
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   From the Korean side.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   Oh, from the get go.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.900]   So I would say two years?
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.900]   Two years.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.900]   Two years.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.120]   And so two years, you're with the Korean side.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.840]   And then after two years, physically leave.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.040]   This is we're talking probably 1999-2000 at this point.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:27.120]   So when you leave the Korean side, 1999-2000, around there, how many people do you have
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.860]   with you?
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.560]   The people in the EM that was actually physically with us that was not in high school, probably
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   14.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.560]   14.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.040]   And when you say not in high school, the high school kids didn't come with you, obviously.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.040]   They did.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   Oh, they did.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   Okay.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   A few of them.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   Actually, the parents sent them.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   Okay.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.680]   Parents sent them because once we left, there was nobody in the EM.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.600]   Like all the teachers were, even though we only had 15-20 people.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.880]   Oh, actually, we had probably about 25 in the EM, but a good chunk of them, when we
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.520]   left, they stayed there or something happened.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.760]   So we had maybe about 15-20 come with us.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.800]   And then the college, some of the, sort of their senior in high school, they didn't graduate
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   high school yet.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.160]   So some of them joined us because the parents wanted them to come with us because we were
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   their teachers.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:24.200]   So that was, like, David Rim, Kevin Osako, Aaron Choi came later, so maybe about another
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.920]   8 of them.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.960]   So our total number was about 25.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.560]   David Rim, Kevin Osako, they're in high school at the time.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.560]   Kevin Osako.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   No, no, no.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.560]   Sorry.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.560]   They would be, like, first year college.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.400]   No, they were still in high school.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.600]   We came out, like, around February or March, so they were at the tail end of their high
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.600]   school.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.600]   So you're in 1999.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   Same year.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   Okay.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   At what point did we do the name change?
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:55.000]   So it was about a year into that, after we left, that we were at Tustin Baptist.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.840]   And so they allowed us to use the room as long as we took care of their kids.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.040]   So we're kind of in a similar situation because there was no way, we couldn't afford to go
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   anywhere.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.360]   We didn't have money to pay rent.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.040]   So we were in a similar situation, but at another church.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.800]   And it was about a year into it, we decided to change the name.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   Okay.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:21.120]   So after we detached from the initial Korean side, we, by necessity, go to another Korean
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.160]   side.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.840]   And then is it at that place that we changed the name?
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   Yes.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   Okay.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   So it's at Tustin Baptist.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840]   Well, when we were at Tustin Baptist.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   When we were at Tustin Baptist.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.480]   So we carried the name Harvest Community Church to Tustin Baptist.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.720]   So what led to the name change from Harvest?
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.280]   You kind of touched upon it, but what was the actual breaking point where we're like,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.880]   "Well, let's change our name."
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.600]   Well, I always wanted to change it at some point, but the catalyst was we were constantly
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.720]   getting confused with First Harvest.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.840]   And I actually remember when I first came to Berean, they would play in a softball tournament.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.920]   And then I would hear stories about, "Yeah, well, you know, First Harvest and Harvest
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   getting confused."
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:08.520]   And I remember one older dude tapping me saying, "Did you know your church used to be called
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   Harvest?"
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.200]   And I remember saying, "That's not true."
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   But it was true.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.840]   And it wasn't Greg Laurie's Harvest.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   It was our Harvest.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.360]   And at that time, our church, we were struggling.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:26.120]   We had maybe 30 people and then half of them were students, more than half of them.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.400]   We had maybe like two working people.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.120]   And then that church was like, they came out with 170.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.080]   They had full-blown staff.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.880]   And there weren't, at Korean American, the Asian American churches, there was only like
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   one or two.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.080]   So that was the church that everybody knew in Orange County.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.280]   Our church was like, you know, nobody knew who we were.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.300]   And I didn't feel the need to change it because it wasn't like we were trying to advertise.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.800]   But I didn't like the name anyway.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.880]   So it was kind of like, that was kind of like a catalyst, "Let's choose a name that we agree
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.880]   on."
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.760]   You know, Pastor Peter, I know you don't like talking about this, but you know, just
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.840]   curious, you don't have to go too deep into it, but how are you getting supported financially
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.800]   during these years?
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.880]   I mean, basically, we paid rent, whatever we could.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.820]   I mean, they didn't charge much, but we did pay some.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.720]   And then whatever left over was my salary, basically.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.240]   And then Pastor Mark came in maybe about three years after that, three or four years after
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.240]   that.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   So he knows, because he was in charge of taking the record.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:38.760]   So some weeks, it was like $40 was the offering, because each college student would get $1
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.760]   if they were faithful.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   So $40.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.540]   And then some weeks it would be $400.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:50.640]   So I think our total budget per month was maybe about $2,500 to $3,000 a month.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.040]   We're talking gross, obviously.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   Gross, yeah.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   Gross, right.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.280]   There's no health insurance, there's nothing.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.880]   It's just whatever was left over became my salary at that time.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.320]   And so obviously, I had to have different jobs.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.720]   So I worked selling stuff in swap meet, telemarketing, washing cars.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   I mean, that happened before, but any job just to support.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.600]   And then the thing that I had the longest was I was a ESL teacher at La Marada School
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.920]   District for about five years, and that's what supported us.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:27.440]   So by necessity, just by pure necessity, you had to have side jobs in order to keep the
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   church running.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.680]   It kind of begs the question, well, not begs, it raises the question, excuse me.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   Why did you stick around?
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.760]   Like I said, when I came to church, I didn't come with the vision of planting a church.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.140]   I came because I was concerned about the kids.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:55.400]   And then once I got here, I got reattached, and if I left, I didn't think they would survive.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:01.980]   So by that time, I had two kids and then a third kid on the way, and then so obviously
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.260]   it made it even tougher.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:10.080]   But it was kind of like, at that time, it was like having, they were all like my kids.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.500]   So even though, like I'm only nine years older than Joe, but I've known him since he was
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.100]   in junior high school.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.060]   And then the other people, they were in high school, they were literally kids when I met
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.060]   them.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.220]   So even though I'm only like 12, 13 years older, they were like my kids, because I was
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.380]   already married and had kids when they were in junior high school.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:37.380]   And so as an adult now, now I'm 53 and these guys are turning 40, like in a social setting,
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:42.340]   you know, 13 years isn't that huge of a gap, but because I've known them since they were
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.300]   kids, like at that time, they felt more like my kids.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:52.020]   Like I wasn't just their pastor, you know, like Joe, you know, when he was learning how
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:57.860]   to drive, Esther was the one who got in the car, and he used to chauffeur me when I lost
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.180]   my license for godly reasons.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.100]   So he's the one who used to pick me up from my home, and if their car broke down, I was
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.140]   the one who went out and helped them fix their car.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:13.980]   You know, like church, like college application, family issues, you know, so it wasn't just
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.740]   like a pastor, they literally lived at my house.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:29.220]   You know, I know also that you had a home in Corona at one point, and then you had to
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.060]   sell that home in Corona, you know, can you tell us a little bit about that?
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.100]   I know you don't like sharing that.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.980]   And you probably didn't want me to ask the question, but I've asked the question so.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.540]   Well, that was kind of at a breaking point in ministry where I just couldn't do both,
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.540]   you know, at that time.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:50.220]   And then I, long story short, you know, there was a business that I was, I had to take care
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.060]   of in Vegas, I was going back and forth.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:59.380]   And then I came very close to walking away or at least trying to get somebody.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.580]   And I remember, I had that conversation with Joe, Elder Joe, being like, I don't think
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.380]   I can keep doing this.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:11.500]   And maybe if we bring a younger guy who didn't have the financial need, then maybe I can
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.180]   just do a support work.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:19.060]   So I remember, like, I was on the verge, and I remember him telling me, and obviously,
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.860]   you know, he didn't fully grasp what was going on, like, he knew mentally, but obviously
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.860]   he was young.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:30.460]   And he said, if you left, the church isn't going to survive, which is probably true,
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.140]   you know.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.860]   But inwardly I'm thinking, man, like I can't feed my kids, how am I going to keep doing
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.860]   this?
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.860]   Right?
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.860]   So I was kind of at a breaking point.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.580]   And then so he's the first guy that I talked to, and then I talked to my mom, and then
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.940]   I thought she would say, "Hey, you've done enough, you need to leave."
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.420]   And she said, you know, "If God called you to do this, you can't do anything else."
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.420]   You know?
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.580]   Because she wasn't really that happy about me going to ministry in the first place.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:02.020]   So when she said, "You can't, you can't leave," that was kind of a surprise to me that my
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.860]   mom said that to me.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.820]   And then I talked to my wife, Esther, and then I knew Esther wanted me to quit, because
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.940]   it was so hard for her.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:16.580]   And then she said, "As much as I want you to quit, I know you.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:24.620]   If you could be happy and live a normal life as a businessman doing something, then, yeah,
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.780]   that's what I would want.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.780]   But I know you.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:33.060]   Like God called you, and I know sooner or later you're going to feel like you're not
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.700]   doing what you're supposed to do."
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.300]   So she's the one who kind of kicked me back in.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.940]   But at that time if Joe said, "That's great," you know, if my mom said, "Good," and then
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.500]   Esther's like, "Finally," I think that would have been it.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.340]   I didn't have the strength at that time to keep going.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:55.220]   And it was because they kind of like - Joe just kind of told me the reality, which I
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.340]   already knew, you know.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.580]   But at that time, I mean, even though he was young, he was kind of like the right-hand
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.580]   man at that time.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.580]   Right.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.580]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:10.020]   Yeah, so if I got my history down correctly, you actually had to sell the home to make
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.500]   ends meet.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.580]   That was like the only way that we could survive at that time, because it was so much credit
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.580]   card bill.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.580]   I needed to pay it off.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.700]   And then that's when the market was going crazy.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.180]   Somebody would buy a house for $200,000 and sell it for $400,000 in two years.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.220]   And then so found out that we had about $70,000 in equity in the house.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.900]   I bought it for $170,000, and then we were able to sell it for $200,000.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.460]   No, no, sorry, $130,000 and sell it for $200,000.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:40.080]   So there was $70,000 or something like that equity in the house.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.660]   And so I paid off all the credit card bills, and I had maybe about $30,000, $20,000 left.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.900]   And then so my plan was to completely use that.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.740]   And at the end of that, when I have nothing, then I have no choice.
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.940]   I have to get a full-time job and take care of my family.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.880]   But as long as I had equity in the house, walking away at that time meant you walked
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.180]   away with something.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.680]   I can't come before God and say, "I have nothing."
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.900]   So because there was equity in the house, my thought was more, I gave everything I have,
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.420]   and then I had three kids I got to take care of, and church can't support me, what other
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   choice do I have?
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.940]   So I cannot walk away with a clear conscience.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.980]   So in my mind, I was thinking that that was probably more likely.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:23.980]   Now you would end up walking away.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.860]   I would end up like, because I have no money.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.620]   And I'm not walking away because I'm quitting.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.020]   I'm walking away because I got to take care of my family.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:36.980]   As the events are kind of playing out, I mean, you are physically, financially not being
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.140]   able to, you're not supported by the church.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.300]   You have a family of three at the time or two?
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.300]   Three at that time.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.500]   Yeah, a family of three at the time.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.820]   There's no money coming in.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.740]   The last reserve of money is in your home.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:54.860]   And so you kind of sell that, thinking, well, if this runs out, then you've done everything
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.860]   you could.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.340]   Everyone's called to take care of their family.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.940]   You're worse than an unbeliever if you don't.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.580]   So humanly speaking, you're thinking, this is it, right?
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.540]   I mean, it's likely going to run out, but it didn't run out.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.940]   It didn't run out.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:15.380]   Well, what happened was, and Joe was actually there when my lights got turned off.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.460]   I came back from Vegas, and Faith was an infant.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.580]   And then Esther walked out of the room saying, "Oh, how come the lights didn't turn off?"
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.700]   And she's just kind of like, "Ha, ha, ha, they came and turned it off, because I didn't
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.700]   pay the bills."
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.820]   So Joe just happened to be in the house when that happened.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.820]   And I think that's when he kind of realized, oh, shit, this is bad.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.060]   What were you thinking when that happened, Joe?
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:47.180]   Well, again, I already knew, because I was, interestingly enough, at that time, I was
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:52.620]   going with Pastor Peter to Vegas once in a while when I could for his business.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:30:02.940]   And then I was seeing the issues of how this was affecting him, having to drive four hours
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.420]   every week.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.740]   And I saw it on Esther, he would be gone.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:17.700]   So I mean, I was already in the standpoint of, this can't continue like this.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:23.620]   A side note, at one time, the church gathered with those who were working.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:32.460]   And we discussed kind of like a monthly stipend, we would pitch in more just to be able to
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.980]   give to Pastor Peter for him to survive.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:42.060]   So I mean, everyone knew, most of us were too young, but some of us at that time were
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.140]   working finally.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:54.620]   But knowing and talking to him on a weekly basis, I knew it was getting harder and harder.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:01.740]   So the equity you had in your home as reserve for your savings actually does run out.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.300]   How are you sustained?
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:09.660]   So after we sold the house, we moved to Irvine, and then we got a house where we were able
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.660]   to take care of my parents.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.660]   Well, you're renting.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.660]   When you say not house, you're renting a house.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.660]   Yeah, we're renting.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:19.260]   And then all the thing happened out of that house, like all the Bible studies, meetings,
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.940]   because that's all we had.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.500]   We were meeting at UC Irvine, but UC Irvine started ticketing people, so we couldn't meet
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.500]   there anymore.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.980]   So that's why the Bible study moved to my house.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.860]   And then it just started growing, and that's about the time when you came, right?
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.460]   And then Pastor Mark was, I think, already there, right, a couple of years before that.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.060]   And then the church went from, we had 30, like in January, and then we had actually
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.060]   people leave.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.660]   We had about 10 people leave, who were kind of like, you know, wanted to go somewhere
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.900]   bigger, you know, and then when, but when 10 people would leave, like one person would
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.340]   leave, one other person would come, you know.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.460]   And I remember very distinctly, one of the first people who came to church at that time
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:08.940]   was Steve, Steve Lee, him and his gang buddies, the star tattoo gang buddies, they came in,
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.980]   and then another couple would leave, and then another would come.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:17.180]   So by June, we had 30, but half, like I would say about half the church, or one third of
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.220]   the church was new.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.060]   And anybody who was disgruntled at that time basically took off.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.780]   Like our church isn't going anywhere, and then when they took off, and then new blood
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.780]   came in.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.860]   So we had, we had guys who were committed, and then, and then the new people came in.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.380]   So the church completely changed within that year.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:41.340]   So by the time we had our summer retreat, we had about 25 come, but there were 25, like
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.820]   committed people, who either are excited to be there, or the guys who were discipled and
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:50.420]   raised up, and you know, they were all leaders at TCM, and you know, Pastor Aaron was there,
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:56.220]   and you know, Ray Cosley came and preached, and then, so by August, the money ran out.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.820]   But our church started to grow, you know.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.180]   By August of 1999, or no, August of what year?
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.060]   It was, that was about five, six years into the church religion at that time.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.060]   Okay.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.660]   So it was like 2002, something like that.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.660]   2002.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.660]   When did the lights go out in your home?
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.660]   That previous year.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.660]   Okay.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.200]   So if it was 2002, it was 2001, maybe.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.460]   So how are you surviving from 2001, 2002?
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.860]   I don't know, credit card.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:31.580]   So you ended up blasting through the reserves, and you ended up racking up a little bit more
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.580]   debt.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.340]   Yeah, so what happened was, at the end of August, you know, now I can't quit, because
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:42.100]   the need in the church is growing, and we're starting to get momentum, new people are coming.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.140]   And then, so that's when the elders, like I told them, I'm going to have to go back
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.180]   to work, and then that's when the elders got together.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.380]   So at that time, it was Vince, Joe, and Phillip.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:55.260]   Basically, they pitched in about like $100 each, and it wasn't a lot of money, but it
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.540]   was enough to, you know, survive.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.260]   So at that time, we didn't have health insurance, we had, you know.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:08.540]   So basically, my salary went from gross $2,000 to $2,300 gross, and then with nothing else.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.880]   But that was just enough to like, to survive at that time.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:18.660]   And so they did that for about a year, and then after that year, then the church got
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.580]   a little bit better, so they replaced that with the church.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.500]   And then so, just by incrementally, it didn't go from that to like, "Oh, I'm taken care
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   of."
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.260]   It was incrementally, it got better each year.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:34.660]   - Yeah, and you know, what's interesting is, during this time, we leave Tustin Baptist,
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:40.260]   and the first place we go to is, correct me if I'm wrong, Lakeside Middle School.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.260]   - Lakeside Middle School.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.260]   - Lakeside Middle School.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.380]   We're at Lakeside Middle School for how many years, would you say, Pastor Peter, around?
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.380]   - Three?
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.860]   About three, yeah, about three years.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.100]   - Three years.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.260]   And during this time while we're at Lakeside Middle School, while all this is going on,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.100]   Pastor Mark, you come in.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.200]   You come into Bruin Community Church.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:05.460]   You came into UCI as a freshman, 2001, I believe, 2001.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.060]   And the first church that you went to was Bruin Community Church.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.060]   Is that...
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:15.340]   - So no, I did the typical thing where you come up to the freshman year, and then you
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.340]   just start checking all the churches.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:24.540]   I tried, there was a few Christians in my dorm at UCI, so I tagged along, visited a
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.540]   few churches.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:31.580]   And at that time, I even, from old friends that I knew in San Diego, visited churches
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.620]   out in Riverside.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:39.420]   But I do remember the first time out to Bruin, an old friend of mine from San Diego, he said
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.940]   he had a sister who could take me to church.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:47.580]   Found out that the sister didn't even go to Bruin, but just recommended it, picked me
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.900]   up, dropped me off kind of thing.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:55.060]   And from the very first sermon, I was blown away, partially because I didn't know what
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.900]   he was talking about.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:02.860]   But he was passionate, but I do recall he was talking about, if you actually believe
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:09.620]   in the ramifications of hell, and if you take a moment to actually meditate, then it would
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.460]   absolutely change everything about you, you know?
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:17.500]   I remember just thinking, he's absolutely right, I just don't know what he's saying.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:22.620]   And then, it just so happened that actually one of my dorm mates or friends from the dorm
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.180]   was Abby, who was Aaron's sister.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.460]   She said, well they have a Bible study, she knew about the Bible study that was happening
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:34.140]   at UCI, and it just so happened to be a skip and a hop away from the dorm.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.660]   And so I'd go there, and at that time, Bruin was going through Revelation, and there was
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:43.220]   a little worksheet too that said, what is an apostle, what is prophecy here?
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.100]   And then I'm just sitting there thinking, well I don't know.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:52.380]   So a ton of this stuff was going over my head, but at the same time, it was very convicting.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:57.020]   Because as a young, at the time I was essentially a younger believer, having been converted
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.500]   at the end of high school.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:06.820]   So I was passionate in love with Christ, but a lot of the things I just didn't know.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.540]   Yeah, so that Bible study obviously was led by Pastor Peter, the Revelation one.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.060]   I mean, he was the only pastor for years.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:24.020]   I mean, we have four pastors now, but Midweek Bible Study, Sunday Sermon, that was all Pastor
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.020]   Peter.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.700]   And I come after, you're actually the one that brings me to Bruin, but I remember going
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.460]   to Pastor Peter's house in my wetsuit, because I just thought, I'm gonna surf and then go
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.820]   to church, so I'll just come in my wetsuit.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:50.820]   But this idea of where, you hear Pastor Peter's preaching, you don't understand all of it.
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.540]   You're not appreciating all of it, but you know that it's good.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.900]   You know that it's good, and because of that, this is somewhere you want to be.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.140]   This is something that you want to be a part of.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:09.920]   And would you say that was how we all felt?
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.380]   We still feel that way, but that's something that was in the culture of the church.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.380]   Would you say that?
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.380]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:24.340]   I think one of the, not necessarily a motto, but a repeated phrase, Pastor Peter would
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.860]   describe and the elders would describe is that God's people hear His voice and they
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   know Him.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.540]   That's something that was reiterated.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.140]   And I think that was seen, because we would hear and then we would realize your personal
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:44.580]   discovery within the scriptures, that is the authority and power of God hitting you.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:50.460]   So for me as a young Christian at the school, I actually felt like I was riddled with sin
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.460]   all around.
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:58.140]   Temptation to, I don't know, everything from lust to pride to everything you can experience,
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.180]   I just felt it.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.580]   And then so there's this weird thought in my head, like I love Jesus, but why am I such
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.060]   a horrendous sinner?
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:11.780]   But I think realizing that the capture was as I was hearing the word, I felt like God's
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:18.420]   power, His power to change, His voice and authority to tell me what's right from wrong,
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.420]   that's all there.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.180]   So we absolutely felt that kind of sentiment.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:27.660]   That's why I think, even the Bible started to talk about it at his house, it was funny
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:28.660]   to me.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.860]   We would be just sitting on his piano bench and then people would be lined up against
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:37.680]   the stairs, just like eagerly wanting to study, you know, we'd have questions, we'd come prepared.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.020]   And so there was a ton of excitement just from that kind of pure attraction to the scriptures.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.140]   I came after you, like I said, you're the one that brought me to Berean, but I remember
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:53.100]   those days and Pastor Peter would post 10 questions on the website.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:57.340]   And back then it was like a bulletin board website, you know, I mean, it was very rudimentary.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.580]   - Hey, hey, hey, that was me.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.580]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.580]   That was great.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.580]   - So good.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.420]   - That was the best website ever.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:12.220]   But those questions were difficult and difficult in the sense that, I mean, it was typical
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:18.700]   for us to spend a couple of hours before the Bible study to come and, you know, like when
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.700]   we gathered on Friday, that was the entire church obviously gathering because it's not
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.740]   like there's not many of us to begin with.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:30.540]   But we came prepared just 'cause that was what we all wanted.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.100]   No one needed to really tell us to come prepared.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.580]   That's my memory.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:43.180]   But that's just something that we all did, you know, and the Bible study and the fellowship,
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.060]   just like today was so sweet, you know, it was extremely sweet because there's a small
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:51.460]   group of us, we don't have a building yet, we're meeting at the pastor's home and this
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.260]   is what we wanna do, right?
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.300]   - But Pastor Peter, what's your first memory of Pastor Mark?
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   Do you remember him at all?
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.740]   - Yeah, of course I remember him.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:06.380]   The girl who brought him was only at our church for maybe like a month and so that was probably
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:12.140]   the greatest contribution to our church that's only been for a month.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:18.660]   And then Pastor Mark was like loved by everybody because it was a running joke at church like
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.900]   we would have one visitor per year and he was that one visitor.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.420]   And then so, and everybody was like a couple years older than him so they treated him like
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.740]   a younger brother.
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:31.220]   So basically everybody targeted him, you know?
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.820]   So I didn't know where he was spiritually at that time.
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:38.700]   I knew he was a Christian but like where he was, but I just knew that, you know, all the
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.940]   older brothers were reaching out to him, all the older sisters were reaching out to him
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.500]   and then, so it didn't take much for him to get integrated into the church.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:51.620]   That's why I remember like when we had the welcome team, he was in charge of recording.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:57.060]   So he has the records of like, you know, when our team would go to China, it would be recorded
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:03.740]   15, seven leading praise and seven singing, you know, and so he remembers all of that.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.740]   He was our record keeper.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.260]   Elder Phil, you've been awfully quiet.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.540]   When you come into the picture in all of this, I mean, you're the pastor's brother, at what
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.900]   point do you come into the picture?
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.940]   I started coming probably a year after the church started.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:28.140]   So I got married in 1997, so the church started, I guess, April.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.780]   My brother is part of the church in August.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:37.180]   I think a year later, I got married in July and a year later we joined because I was also
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:44.620]   with him when he left Irvine Baptist, attended church together and then we for a period went
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.900]   to, I think, Sergius Presbyterian Church or something, yeah, see?
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:58.220]   And then got married, I don't know, took a year away and then, yeah, there was a point
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:04.420]   where I'm going to, you know, go to church, you know, with my family, just me and Mary.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:12.900]   So we went through a process of discussion and prayer and we decided to go to my brother's
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:21.020]   church and it was a very young church, yeah, okay, it was a very young church, but for
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:27.060]   me it was easy, you know, because it's my brother, you know, even when he was pastoring
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:32.020]   as a youth pastor at Irvine Baptist, I would come on college, you know, when I was in college
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.020]   come and help.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:38.240]   So I knew everybody, I know it was a little bit harder for Marian, but it took a little
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:45.780]   bit more time for her, but like anything else, yeah, so, I mean, timing-wise, you know, that's
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:52.500]   when I came and I never questioned coming to the church and being part of it, even though
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:58.460]   the church was small, but it was home for me, I always felt like it was home.
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:02.420]   Well, you know, you're watching all these events unfold, I mean, you're here just a
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:07.500]   year after Pastor Peter gets here, what are your thoughts as you're, you know, you're
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:13.340]   seeing your brother go through all this and, because you lived in Corona, you still do,
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.420]   and so you guys both live in the same city, you know, Pastor Peter mentioned he had to
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.820]   sell his home, you know, what were your thoughts seeing all this and, you know, having to support
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.820]   your brother?
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:27.900]   Yeah, so my brother coming to Corona, like always, he wants to follow what I'm doing,
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:34.860]   just kidding about that, but, no, part of it I really didn't know, you know, part of
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:40.420]   the, he didn't share a lot of, so I learned, you know, some of this stuff by just after
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:52.260]   the fact, but at the same time, I just, I got married, I just had a kid, in 2001, Jonathan,
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:45:00.100]   I just got a new job, so I was pretty engrossed in my own career at the time, but I knew what,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:08.380]   you know, the difficulty of the traveling, and then I, you know, we visited as a family
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:13.900]   to what was happening over there, so there was a level of excitement, and because, oh,
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:21.060]   there's this new thing going on, but I also saw the weight of the problem, not the problem,
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:29.380]   but obviously the difficulty, because we're at a small church, so one aspect is, I definitely
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:37.620]   saw God's hand in when my brother, Pastor Peter, sold his house, and made the decision
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:46.220]   to move to Irvine, and that was, coincidental or not, I mean, that was the moment, I think,
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:56.260]   when the church grew, and from my perspective, I thought it was appropriate, because before
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:03.540]   that time, even though we only had like 30, 35 people coming to church, our Bible study
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:08.900]   attendance, pretty consistent, were 30, so we basically had most of our church attend
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:14.740]   church, also attend Bible study, and then all the people, even though they were young,
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:24.060]   they were very hungry, so I think it was when Pastor Peter came to Irvine, I think it was
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:32.620]   just that moment that God used at the perfect timing, I guess, that just launched the growth,
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:39.980]   but before then, I think all the precursor of church growth was set, just the consistent
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:47.140]   Bible study, consistent teaching, it's just that, I guess, I see God's hand in all this,
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.780]   so I guess God had to orchestrate all this.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.140]   He was kind of laying the foundation for the explosive growth.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:59.040]   Right, I think the foundation was there, and I think just everything just came together
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.660]   when my brother moved down to Irvine, and made the commitment that he did, and that's
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:09.460]   when, I mean, literally, it was, he moves down, and you could just see the, start seeing
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.460]   the growth.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:18.380]   Yeah, you know, Pastor Peter, you kind of mentioned, you alluded to the 2003 retreat
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:24.900]   with Pastor Ray Causley that was in Palm Desert, not Palm Springs, and we showed that photo,
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:33.740]   we showed that photo to new members, but at the time, I want to say with kids, there's
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   about 30 of us.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.740]   Yeah, with kids.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.740]   With kids.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.740]   That's with the Pastor's family.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.740]   Right.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:43.460]   Pastor Ray's, and he had three kids at that time, four kids, he had, oh, he had three
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.380]   kids, and I think I had three.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.260]   Yeah, three.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:56.780]   Yeah, and what's interesting is, I know for, I think someone has articulated, that was
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:01.260]   kind of like a turning point, would you say, Pastor Peter, like that, after that retreat,
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.260]   or?
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:06.220]   I want to say it was the retreat, because that was already happening in February, so
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:11.460]   by the time we got to the retreat, it was already complete, like, change of, you know,
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:16.660]   the old, people were grumbling left, and then new people came in, and so we had a group
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.460]   that was really hungry, and then so, that was our very, we've never had any retreat
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.460]   before that.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.780]   That was the first retreat, and then so, I think what that retreat did was kind of like
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:32.060]   solidify, you know, what we were doing, it kind of, because it was the first time when,
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:36.780]   you know, like, we actually got together, outside of our house, we never been anywhere,
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:41.340]   did anything, hardly any activity, we had Friday Bible study, and then Sunday worship,
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.340]   and that was it.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:45.380]   Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's kind of like wild.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:52.260]   When I think about, I am older than you were when I first met you, you know, and to me,
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.500]   you've kind of like, you know, you've always been my pastor, so there's a sense in which
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:04.180]   you've always been 50, but obviously, that's not true, obviously, you know, but I remember
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.900]   that retreat, because I've been, at that time, I think I've been at the church somewhere
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.500]   less than a year, somewhere less than a year.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:16.260]   I remember coming to Berean, you know, Pastor Mark brought me to Berean, and I remember
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:20.020]   thinking I'll never come to Berean, I was going to Calvary Chapel at the time, and then
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.300]   I just knew I had to leave Calvary Chapel, because the church was too big, I wasn't getting
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:31.020]   any fellowship, and I was getting all my fellowship at Campus Ministry, which is extremely unhealthy,
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:36.900]   and so Pastor Mark brings me to Berean Community Church, and I remember hearing you preach
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.700]   Sunday and Friday, but Friday was actually the first time, Friday was also the first
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.340]   time, because I remember thinking, "Oh, he's teaching the Bible."
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.580]   I remember that was like kind of, and there was like this burning sensation in my heart,
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:57.820]   and I remember everyone else felt the same, and everyone that was there had the same burning
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:02.980]   desire, but I had to, I had to talk to you to make sure that you were actually who you
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:08.140]   say you are, I don't know why, I don't know who I think I am, but that's what college
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.140]   students think, right?
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:16.860]   So I had to, I remember asking you questions, it was my version of testing you, and that
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:24.860]   obviously didn't last long, and this became my church, but it was, I came in 2002, 2003,
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:32.100]   five, six years after the launch, but when I come in, again, we're still 30 people with
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:39.300]   everybody, including little kids, everybody, so from 1997 to 2002, 2003, well 2003 for
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:51.460]   sure, we're about like 20, 30 people, but to us, it was enough, it was absolutely enough,
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:51:00.700]   and I remember you just ingraining in us, "Study the Bible, do what it says, and don't
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.020]   turn from it to the left or the right."
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.420]   That was kind of like, if we had a mantra, that would have been it, I mean, our name
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.540]   is "Bring Community Church," right?
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:18.220]   So after that retreat, after that retreat, we have someone else in this room that comes
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:22.620]   into the picture at some point, oh, that's actually Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.460]   So Pastor Chung, when did you come into this picture?
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:33.100]   Well, so that retreat conflicted with, I was a high school pastor at the time of a group
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:39.600]   of about 100, and at that point, I had been meeting with Pastor Peter for about five months.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:44.580]   I was actually pretty close to trying to figure out how to leave my retreat that I was supposed
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:53.980]   to run to go to this retreat, so I was super jealous, but that was my third year in ministry,
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:59.140]   and I had no idea what I was doing, and that the counsel that I sought from the pastors
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:05.380]   at the church that I was working at, they would all tell me things that really weren't
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:13.140]   that helpful, and so I was on my way out, and a friend introduced me to Pastor Peter,
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:20.240]   and I actually just logged on to the website, listened to three sermons, two of them were
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:25.340]   out of Numbers chapter 11, and I was just listening to the content, and I was like,
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:31.820]   I've never heard someone preach out of like the censuses before, and just, I was almost
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:37.140]   taking notes verbatim, and I was thinking, you know, I really want a man like this to
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:41.440]   give me some kind of guidance, because I'm on my way out, I want to learn how to leave
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:47.620]   a church well, and try to figure out like the next steps in my life.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:53.880]   So we started meeting, I asked him out for lunch, it was March 31st, 2003, and we met
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:53:00.020]   at Tyco in Irvine, and then at that meeting, I was like, you know, this is who I am, this
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:09.440]   is what I need, and I asked him, can you just mentor, disciple me, because I really am desperate,
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.360]   and so we actually started meeting every Wednesday.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:16.280]   So every Wednesday morning, I would actually come, there was a coffee bean on Alton and
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:21.200]   Jeffrey, so I would be there from like 7.30 to about lunch, and then Pastor Peter and
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:25.720]   I would meet at Tyco, grab lunch, and then I would go back to the coffee bean, study
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:30.960]   for about 5 more hours, preparing the Bible study, and I would go the Wednesday night,
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.480]   and the Wednesday night was really small at the time, I was actually the youngest person
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.680]   there for a few months, the next youngest was Elder Joe, and it was like 11 people,
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.920]   so Friday nights were the college where the bulk of the people were meeting, but Wednesdays
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:48.720]   were like, I guess the adults, older people at the church, and like I said, I was just
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:55.880]   really hungry, taking everything in, but I was kind of at a dilemma, because I didn't,
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:01.400]   I wanted to leave my church, but similarly to Pastor Peter's experience, I couldn't just
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:07.040]   leave the students, so I actually ended up being there 2 more years, and I didn't come
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:13.600]   to Berean officially until about 2005, but for about 2 years, I was actively trying to
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.920]   be at everything I possibly could, I got into a little bit of trouble at my church, we had
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.480]   a big garage sale for the missions fund, but then I gave all the mission fund to our China
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:28.000]   team for Berean, New Year's Eve service, as the high school pastor, I was supposed to
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.360]   be at our church, but then I ended up coming to Berean because I wanted to play some, the
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:42.000]   youth with the Bereans, and so yeah, I didn't handle it particularly wisely, but my heart
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:50.200]   was at Berean starting March of 2003, and I would consider Berean my church, even though
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.360]   I was on staff at a different church for a couple years, but that's how it all started.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.080]   That's interesting, because you mentioned that there was a Bible study on Wednesday,
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:04.240]   so Pastor Peter, I'm actually learning this for the first time, you know, and I've been
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:10.000]   here since 2003, you were doing 2 Bible studies, one on Wednesday and one on Friday?
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.880]   So the Bible study he's talking about just started, because that's when the church was
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.760]   starting to grow, and we couldn't fit them all on Friday, so we took anybody out of college,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:25.720]   which was at that time, I think like 7 maybe, 7 or 8 started meeting at my house on Wednesday,
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   so.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.720]   I actually do remember that.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.280]   It came in like, I think, like a month after we started Wednesday, something like that.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:36.240]   Yeah, the study was 1 John, and then my first Wednesday there was like 1 John 2:15, "Do
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   not love the world or anything in the world," so I was just really excited just to be there
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240]   and learn.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.520]   Yeah, you know, what's interesting is, I do remember that now, now that we're articulating
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:52.000]   it, what's also interesting is, as I'm thinking back on when I first came, that makes sense
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.200]   because I don't remember seeing you, Elder Joe, on Friday.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.060]   So, I'm like, I'm thinking like, "Oh, where were you?
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:58.060]   Oh, you were on Wednesday."
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.060]   Or Philip, or Marian.
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:03.360]   Yeah, now that I'm thinking about that, it makes sense, and I actually do remember this
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.240]   Wednesday Bible study, like, talking about in passing, I'm just in college, so I don't
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   care.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.000]   I'm just, I'm just surfing.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.800]   I'm surfing, and I'm listening to this guy teach me about the Bible, and all I remember
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.440]   is that it was pretty cool.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.000]   You know, I have this distinctive memory about you, Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.720]   I know you remember it, too, because you remember everything, but you would refer to Berean as
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.720]   Canaan.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.720]   Do you remember that?
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.720]   I do.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:33.580]   Can you tell us a little bit about why, I mean, I think people can kind of get the idea,
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.000]   but tell us about it.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.640]   One thing was, I was really hungry, so that was actually when I was spending about six
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:44.720]   to eight hours a day at Coffee Bean, just in the Bible, memorizing it, studying it,
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:52.840]   preparing sermons, and I think, just, I mean, this is not on the church that I was at, but,
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.200]   you know, they were trying to push for things like, you know, let's just do this 40 days
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   of purpose.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.080]   That was when the purpose-driven life was big.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.680]   Let's do this 40 days of purpose as a whole church, and I said, no, like, I'm teaching
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   through First Peter.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:09.520]   I don't want to do 40 days of, like, a study of a book, and little things like that, where
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:17.800]   it was a little bit more studies about the Bible, rather than studies through the Bible,
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.960]   and you know, on the Wednesday night Bible studies, I would come, and the, you know,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.160]   eight or nine other people that were there, they were so eager and hungry to not talk
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:34.040]   about culture, not talk about, like, churchianity, but to just get into the text, and so I started
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.840]   seeing change in my ministry.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.920]   My group actually went from 100 to, like, 30 kids on Friday nights, because I stopped
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.720]   doing the programs and stuff, and I was like, okay, I'm doing something wrong, I'm about
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.720]   to get in trouble, but the ones that are there, like the 30 or so that are there, they're
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:55.480]   actually enjoying, like, actually just studying the Bible, and so, for me, the philosophies
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.280]   of ministry kind of were starting to conflict.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:04.840]   I wanted to do the, you know, read the Bible, study the Bible, and do what it says, but
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:10.120]   then the church as a whole, which is very typical of churches at the time, were just,
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:14.680]   you know, like, take care of the people, make sure they don't leave the church, and so with
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:20.240]   that, there was a lot of tension in my heart, but I couldn't just leave the 30 that were
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.960]   there, so I felt like I was kind of leading the group of, I mean, on Sunday, there were
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:31.820]   like 100 to 120 kids there for attendance, but the ones that I was actually discipling,
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:39.480]   I couldn't just abandon them, and so, yeah, so I was stuck there in many senses, the word,
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:46.240]   where I couldn't leave, and so I had to put in my time for an extra two years, but I wanted
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:52.320]   to be at Berean so badly, but that's, so I considered that like a wilderness trials for
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   me.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:56.000]   - And you know, you weren't coming to Berean as a pastor.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   - No.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.160]   - You were just coming to Berean.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.160]   - Right.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.160]   - Period.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:04.120]   It wasn't like Pastor Peter offered you some kind of position, you were just coming to,
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   just to come.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   - Right.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.120]   - Yeah.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:11.480]   You know, what's interesting, from your perspective, Pastor Peter, you know, there's this guy that
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:18.800]   you meet, he's hungry to grow, he's starving to meet with you, but he doesn't go to our
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.800]   church.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   What was kind of going through your head at the time?
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   - Can I say?
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:32.440]   So, he was actually, I actually met with him because of the girl that he was dating at
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:39.800]   that time, and she asked me, my boyfriend is burnt out, he's a youth pastor, you know,
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.100]   can you at least talk to him?
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:45.560]   So she was pretty new to the church too, so I didn't really know her well, and I have
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:50.800]   a heart for young pastors, you know, just because you're going through the same thing
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.480]   and being burnt out, and so it was just to really have lunch with him.
[00:59:55.480 --> 01:00:00.520]   It wasn't to like, we're going to keep meeting up, and then, you know, but it was right at
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.880]   that time when I prayed about selling the house, and then I, now for the first time
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.960]   I'm not working, so I'm praying, like I got all this time going back and forth to Vegas
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.400]   for like, you know, 10 months, then I got all that freed up, and then, so I was praying
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.880]   like what, what should I do with my, where do I invest my time, so I was praying that
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.200]   every day, like now I have this time, you free me up, what am I going to do?
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.720]   And then that's when like he, you know, I met him, then right after I met him, literally
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:33.240]   I had one lunch with him, and the next email I get is, can you mentor me?
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:39.360]   Like he doesn't know me, I don't know him, you know, but because I prayed that prayer,
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.600]   if I wasn't in that situation I probably would have said no, because I don't know him, you
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.920]   know, and then, but because I prayed that, and then he shows up, it's like, oh, maybe
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.760]   this is God, you know, like answering my prayer, and so I couldn't say no, because I felt like
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.040]   God put him in that position, and then, you know, like I said, oh, I got all these church
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.640]   people that I need to pay attention to, but he just happened to, and then he happened
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.600]   to be a pastor, so I thought maybe if I can meet with him, and it was, he wasn't thinking
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.840]   like, oh, he's going to eventually come to our church, that he can influence his kids
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.000]   that he's ministering to.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   That's what led to that.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.480]   But I remember the very first impression when I met him was like, that guy's huge, and he's
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   thick.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.000]   That was my first impression, yeah.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.920]   Second impression is like, he's hungry, yeah, he's really hungry, like why?
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.160]   You know, like typically, if I meet somebody I don't know, there's always this kind of
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.160]   like, oh, who are you?
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.720]   You know, what do you know?
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.440]   Should I respect you, honor you, like, you know, there's usually that period, but I could
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.760]   tell that he was, he's already hit kind of bottom, meaning like, he goes, I don't know
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.200]   where to go, what do I do, can you help me?
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.380]   So he came in, like from the get-go he was like that.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.680]   So that's why I thought, okay, if I can kind of get him on the right track, because at
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.920]   that time he was talking about going into law, he was going to drop out and maybe go
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   back into law.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.400]   I mean I could tell he was, you know, he had the brain, even from our first meeting.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.560]   But it really didn't take much.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.360]   It was just kind of like, do your quiet time, read the Bible, and then I remember the first
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.720]   impression after meeting with him maybe about two, three months, because I would quote scripture
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.020]   to him and at the end of the conversation he would quote it back to me.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:24.080]   So in the first few months I was thinking, oh, this guy, you know, he memorized a lot
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080]   of scripture.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.760]   And I realized he was just hearing what I said and spinning it back to me.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.120]   You know, after a while I was like, this guy, this guy's memory is like incredible.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:38.280]   And so, you know, I mentioned this up in the pulpit before, but, you know, once he gets
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.860]   into something, he gets really into it.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:44.400]   And so I didn't realize he was starting to memorize scripture already at that time.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.440]   As soon as he got excited, he poured that energy into just memorizing scripture.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.400]   And I think a lot of it was just pointing him to the right direction and then he just
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.480]   kind of ran with it.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.040]   I mean, for those that don't know, that's Pastor Peter Chung's thing.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.920]   He just memorizes a ton of scripture, you know, and well, that, and he'll tell you what
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.420]   you were doing on January 10th, 2007 at 4.55 PM.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   That's another thing he does.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.360]   And what you were wearing.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.440]   And what you were wearing.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:25.120]   So PPC, when you, Pastor Peter Chung, when you come to Berean without any other obligations,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.520]   what year was that?
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.520]   That was July 2005.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520]   What time?
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:35.680]   Well, it's the first Sunday, I remember like writing my first tithe check the night before.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.560]   One of the students actually, well, a bunch of the students came with me, but I remember
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.640]   like he was laughing at me because I was like giggling as I was writing my tithe check the
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640]   night before.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.440]   And I knew that I wasn't coming to be a, I'm not going to be a pastor at the church.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.160]   So I actually sat in BCC, which is the membership class at the time.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.720]   And you know, Pastor Peter said, just be a member, just be a brother at the church.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.600]   And at that point, when I first started coming to the church, it was 30, but that first Sunday
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   it was about 110.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.360]   It was at Northwood Park.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.680]   And I think it was interesting because my first four Sundays at the church, we had four
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.720]   different speakers, which is very abnormal.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.320]   And so it was, you know, Pastor Peter spoke, and then Pastor Aaron spoke, and then Elder
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.240]   Joe spoke, and then Elder Phillip spoke all, you know, and so I was like, oh, this is kind
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   of cool.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.280]   I get to, because everyone else went to China.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.960]   And so, and then I ended up moving in with a bunch of Berean dudes shortly after with,
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.320]   you know, you Elder James, Pastor Mark, Pastor Aaron Choi, another Berean brother, who's
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.840]   now at BMC.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.560]   But it was like the family that I was like longing to be a part of.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.880]   And so it was a lot of fun.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.920]   And so then starting 2006, I actually got to be an intern at the church, because all
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.320]   of a sudden, like two families with like three or four kids joined the church, and then they
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320]   needed people to help.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.880]   And so I just, I was the right person at the right time in that sense and got interned.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.760]   Well, let me clarify that.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:12.120]   So he's the education pastor now, but the way like for the first seven years of the
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:18.160]   church, we didn't have Sunday school, because it was mainly our kids and Phillip's, you
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.840]   know, at that time, and then my older brother, so it was just our family.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.560]   So we felt kind of bad asking anybody to like just watch our kids while we go into worship.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.320]   So Esther basically couldn't enter worship.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:34.320]   So she would always, you know, stroll the kids outside the sanctuary, just kind of leaning
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   in.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:40.920]   And then at that particular Sunday, two families that close to my age came with kids, our kids'
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   age.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.040]   And then Pastor Peter Chang at that time was not staff, he was just a member of the church.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.040]   And he asked me, "Do you mind if I start something with the kids?"
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.360]   I said, "Oh, not at all."
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.360]   You know?
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.080]   And so he just volunteered.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.360]   He wasn't a staff at the time, he just volunteered to take care of the kids.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.240]   So that was the beginning of our Sunday school.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.580]   And it just happened because those two families came on the same Sunday.
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:09.800]   And then so all of a sudden we had like three kids to like seven kids.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   And that's how it started.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:16.360]   But that's how our first service, we had one service at that time, we started the morning
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.560]   one because of that, because we wanted to have a service for the teachers.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.240]   So there was like six of them.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   - And the lunch crew.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   - And the lunch crew.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.320]   So they would come into first service, we'd have like 10 to 15, and then we would have
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   our main service set.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.260]   And that was the beginning of our first service.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:38.320]   But you know, just ironically, he's the guy who started it, and now he's our education
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320]   pastor.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.840]   - Yeah, there was nothing formal.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:49.160]   There was a need, and someone took initiative, kind of plugged in that need.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:55.940]   Not a lot of people to talk to, right, because I mean, it's just us.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:00.120]   So it's like, oh, there's a need, someone can plug it, kind of worked like that.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.560]   You know, we talked about Pastor Aaron, there's gonna be a lot of people listening who don't
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   know who he is.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:11.720]   Pastor Aaron is a pastor over at BMC in NorCal, Berean Mission Church in NorCal.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.440]   But before becoming the pastor in Berean Mission Church in Northern California, he was here.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.920]   He was here at Berean Community Church.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.520]   For the long time, you were a pastor by yourself.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.320]   What year does Pastor Aaron come in?
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.560]   - Well, Pastor Aaron was here, he was, again, one of those high school students at Irvine
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.360]   Baptist, so I actually knew his parents before I knew him.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.480]   I heard of him through his Sunday school teachers, because he was such a troublemaker, you know,
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.680]   and I heard, there's this kid in Sunday school, this is like when he's like third or fourth
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:46.560]   grade, and he said he jumped on the table during Bible study, but the teacher loved
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:51.160]   him, you know, because they adored him, but he was a handful, and he would tell stories
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.160]   about his parents.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.120]   And I remember my first memory of that age group, because I wasn't their pastor, I was
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.080]   just the EM pastor, and Sunday mornings I would be driving to church and I would see
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:07.320]   him and Luke and, you know, his friends walking to the pizza parlor during service, you know,
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.520]   and then they would be walking back.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:13.080]   So later on I found out that they were using their offering to buy pizza, and then playing
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   video games.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.920]   And I remember every time I would drive up, I would say, "Where are the parents?
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.000]   Why are these kids walking in the big street by themselves?"
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.100]   And then, so I kind of heard of him, and then I left, you know, that one year that I left,
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:34.880]   when I came back, and I was talking to the high school pastor, and he said that there's
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.360]   a student leader that's actually leading Bible study, and he was the only one.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360]   And then he said it was Aaron Choi.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360]   I said, "Aaron Choi?
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.360]   That name's familiar."
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.980]   He said, "But the last time I heard of him was the kid who was jumping on tables."
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.400]   And then when he told me that Aaron was actually a student leader, even in high school, I said,
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.400]   "That kid is a student leader?"
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.780]   Yeah, so he had leadership from, you know, from when he was young.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:03.080]   And he had a big influence on his friends, even through college.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.080]   Yeah, so.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.080]   He went to UCSD.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.080]   He was the ADM.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.600]   He ended up coming back as the advisor as well.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   Right.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.560]   You know, a lot of people here, we roomed together.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.400]   Pastor Peter Chung mentioned it, but Pastor Mark, myself, Pastor Peter Chung, and Aaron
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.520]   lived together for a little bit.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.000]   What year does he come on board as a pastor?
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.100]   I don't know the specific year, but it was.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.300]   He started interning in '03, yeah, at the end of '03.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:35.700]   So he was in college, and then he graduated, and then he was kind of wrestling with what
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:40.980]   he, and so when he went to seminary, he went in as a philosophy, because he wanted to do
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.340]   apologetics because that was his thing.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.360]   And then he changed that, obviously, I think the first year.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:51.940]   And so, you know, I think everybody who knew him were kind of like encouraging him to go
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:57.460]   into ministry, because he had gifting, he had clear influence among his friends.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.820]   And then so, when he came on, obviously, I needed help.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.460]   So when he came on as an intern, I think it was like six months into it, we asked him
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.300]   to oversee the college ministry.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.780]   So I guess that was '03, yeah.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:16.580]   Yeah, so for about six years, you're doing multiple Bible studies, Sunday service, all
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:20.020]   the admin stuff on your own, and then, you know, finally, you get some help, you know,
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.020]   get some help in.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:27.300]   I mean, to be fair, we had elders, you know, Philip was there, Vince was there, maybe a
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.860]   year or two before that.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:29.860]   And Joe was there.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.860]   And Joe was there.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:36.180]   But again, you know, this early on in church, and they have full-time jobs.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.820]   So they were helping with finance, and bits and pieces.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:39.820]   Right, right.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.220]   And the whole church is being helpful.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.620]   I'm just talking about pastoral help.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:43.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:47.300]   Just pastoral help, it's just you, and then Pastor Aaron comes in.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   Right.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.620]   So that was him and I, I don't know, five years, six years?
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.180]   Yeah, and then that goes on for about five, six years.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:00.500]   And then at some point, Pastor Mark, you re-entered this conversation.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:04.580]   You went from member to, I think you're a pastor at this church, right?
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:05.740]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.220]   You come in as a pastor.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.780]   What year was that around?
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:13.940]   My memory is not good, but I'm guessing around 2010.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:14.940]   Is that right?
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:15.940]   I'm looking at you.
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:23.180]   Well, I went to China in '09, and then I think the church took on, from what I believe,
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:29.460]   like three interns at the time, and Pastor Mark was one of the interns that came in right
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.460]   around then.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.940]   And I don't think it was necessarily as a staff, but it had been concurrent to like
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.940]   our departure.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:36.940]   It was 2010.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:37.940]   I think.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.420]   It was 2010, and my memory's bad.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.900]   At that point, has Pastor Aaron already gone to NorCal?
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.900]   No.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:46.900]   Okay.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:47.900]   Okay.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.900]   That was about three years after that.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:50.900]   Okay.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.900]   It's about 2013.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.900]   Okay.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.900]   That's right.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   2013, Pastor Aaron goes to NorCal.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.900]   The reason I'm bringing this in is because during this time, the church just continues
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.900]   to grow.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.780]   It just continues to grow and grow and grow.
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.100]   Pastor Aaron goes to plant in Northern California.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.660]   Berean Mission Church is born.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:12.740]   And then Pastor Peter Chang is in China, and all of a sudden, we're back to two pastors.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:20.020]   We're back to two pastors, and we functioned two pastors at that point in time.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.500]   Do you remember how big the church was?
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.500]   Anyone remember?
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.500]   About 300.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.500]   Right.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.420]   My memory is 200, 300.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:27.420]   We're around there.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:34.740]   And the kind of real bird's eye view is during all these years, we went from Lakeside Middle
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:47.140]   School, and then we went to Harvard Park, which is on Walnut.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.860]   And after Harvard, I think we went to Turtle Rock Community Church.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.020]   And after Turtle Rock Community Church, we went to Northwood.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.740]   Well, before Northwood, we were at Green, what, Deerfield.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740]   Oh, Deerfield.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.740]   Oh, right.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.740]   Deerfield for a short period.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:00.740]   For a short period.
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:01.740]   Basically, community parks in Irvine.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:03.740]   Right.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:08.740]   And then our brother, David Rim, spent the night to make it sure that we wouldn't reserve.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:10.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.740]   And then we swam up to Deerfield.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:12.740]   And Northwood.
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.740]   And then we went to Northwood.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:19.100]   You know, and David Rim is sleeping on the ground to reserve.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.140]   He initiated it, and then eventually, people took turns.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.140]   Yeah, people took turns.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:29.180]   Well, just to clarify, because we were renting a community center, they register, you have
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.420]   to re-register every year.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.500]   And it's first come, first serve.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.740]   So we have to be in line.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:38.940]   So that's why, David, somebody had to sleep the night so we could be on the front line.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.740]   And then, so, at peak, we were there probably three nights.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:47.140]   So we would start, like, it's Friday morning, and then we would be there, like, Tuesday,
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:51.860]   Tuesday or Wednesday, and we have to be there 24 hours, because if we weren't number one
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.860]   in line, we wouldn't get the spot.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:58.900]   Yeah, and Patrick, you're like a, like, you know, a 40, 42-year-old pastor, you're sleeping
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:13:59.900]   outside in Irvine.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.900]   I mean, you were there, too.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.900]   You would sleep outside.
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:07.020]   Yeah, I mean, at that time, we had a rotation, so whoever came in during that rotation, you
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.020]   would be there.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   So it had to be around the clock.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.500]   So a lot of people were taking turns at that time.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:16.300]   And just another input, the reason why we had to move from Lakeside to go to Community
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:22.860]   Park, because I think they raised our hourly rate by maybe 20 bucks an hour, and at that
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:27.980]   time, we couldn't even afford $20 more an hour for the church, so we had to go to somewhere
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.060]   cheaper, and that's why we ended up going to the Community Park.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:39.660]   Our rent was $400, $400 a month, and then it got raised to maybe like $600 or something
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.660]   like that.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.660]   And that would have broke our back.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.260]   Yeah, and we couldn't afford it, and that's why we ended up moving.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:50.620]   Yeah, so while people are coming in and leaving and pastoral staff is going through changes
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:55.620]   at times, you know, everyone's kind of coming from within, you know.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:58.100]   As this is going on, we're moving from park to park.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:04.220]   There's no airway, there's no North Mitchell, South Mitchell, none of that is there at the
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.220]   time.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:10.220]   So we, you know, go from the last park I mentioned was, what was the last park?
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:11.220]   Turtle Rock.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.220]   Turtle Rock.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.740]   So we went from Turtle Rock, and then we go to Ut.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.740]   Northwood.
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.740]   Northwood.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.740]   Northwood, I'm sorry.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.740]   We go to Northwood.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:19.740]   We're there for maybe a year?
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:20.740]   A year.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.740]   A year.
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.860]   And then after Northwood, we go to Ut, and we go to Ut Middle School in Tustin.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:25.860]   We're there for a couple years.
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.860]   Three years.
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:27.860]   We're there three years.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:28.860]   Three years?
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.860]   Okay.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:34.460]   Yeah, we're there for about three years, and at that time, the, you know, three, four years,
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.940]   the church is growing.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:36.940]   The church is growing.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:40.500]   So Ut was the last place we rented from since.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.500]   Am I right?
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.620]   Ut was the last place we rented from since.
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.660]   When we left Ut, how many people were at our church, would you guys say?
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.500]   We had about 220, yeah, 220.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.500]   About 220.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.500]   230, something like that.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.100]   We're filling the auditorium at the time.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:59.460]   I remember thinking, how did our church get so big?
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:02.020]   I'm still surfing, so I mean, I don't really know what's going on.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.700]   I'm just, you know, studying the Bible, you know, just, I'm not taking responsibility
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:08.340]   for anything, but the church is just growing.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.340]   It's just growing.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:16.980]   Again, we went from 30 to now 220 in a matter of just several years.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.100]   What were your thoughts on this past few years, the church is kind of growing?
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.100]   Were you nervous?
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.140]   No, I remember when we first broke 100.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.060]   I was like, that was when we first came to Ut Middle School.
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:31.340]   We went from 90 to 1, we added 20 people like one Sunday, and they said, oh, you know, people
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:35.860]   are coming because we moved, and then, you know, but we never went below 110.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:43.520]   So literally one Sunday, we added 20% to the church, and for some odd reason, we never
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.340]   dipped below that, and then we started going up from there.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:51.420]   So I remember at 100 thinking like, oh man, this is crazy, like how do you run a church
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:55.060]   of 100 people, you know, because they couldn't fit at my house anymore.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:58.740]   So everything that we were doing had to change because we didn't have a location, so we ended
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:04.380]   up renting an office building because we needed somewhere to do Bible study because we couldn't
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.020]   meet at my house anymore.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:14.900]   And then so at Ut, we just slowly incrementally grew to over 200, like 220, 230, and then
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.940]   we, you know, dealing with space and then slowly people started getting married and
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.820]   having kids, and so I remember our greatest challenge was when we hit 200 because the
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.860]   church just didn't feel the same anymore.
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:32.020]   The fellowship wasn't, people aren't hanging out at my house, you know, they're getting
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:36.820]   married, you can't, you know, before, our church was known as a loitering church.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.340]   Once we got together, no one would ever leave.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:43.220]   So on Sunday, we would have worship, we would go out to eat, and we'd be there till 6, 7
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:44.220]   o'clock at night.
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.220]   - And then have dinner together.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:49.380]   - And then have dinner together, and then play basketball, and then the sisters would
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.500]   come and watch, and then hang out.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.020]   Literally every time we got together, we'd say, "Hey, we gotta wake up tomorrow, we gotta
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.020]   go."
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.140]   We'd go to other people's church, and they would ask us to lock up when they were leaving
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.520]   because we wouldn't leave.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.860]   So that's kind of how the culture of the church was, up to about 200.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:10.180]   And then when 200 hit, like everything started changing because people got older, they started
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:14.460]   getting married, having kids, and then at 200 we couldn't hang out like that anymore.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:19.380]   So prior to when Joe got married, like they didn't even invite the church, it was just
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.380]   given.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.060]   Like somebody, a church is getting married, everybody was invited.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.660]   That happened until Pastor Peter Chung's wedding.
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.720]   So like it was assumed anybody at church was going to come to the wedding.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.700]   So he didn't invite, he didn't have to invite, so all these college students showed up, you
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:39.340]   know, and so that's kind of how it was assumed, and then it got to a certain point where we
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:40.340]   couldn't do that anymore.
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.100]   Yeah, but that's how the church was.
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:47.780]   I would say that the greatest challenge in the church was around 200 to 300.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.540]   And that happened when we were at Airway.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:59.780]   So to just kind of backtrack a little bit, we leave Ut, during this time, you alluded
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:02.500]   to it, but we get the office, the church office.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.820]   We don't own it, we're renting it, and that was the coolest thing back then.
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.020]   "Oh, let's go to the church office, we have a place to go to."
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:16.140]   It was just some random office suite, we did our Bible studies there, and we just never
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:20.580]   thought that we would ever own a building, because we were kind of like the Israelites
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.580]   wandering the desert.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:28.940]   There was a kind of sense of pride to that, and then I think part of it is, at least in
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:34.300]   my mind, I mean Pastor Peter teaches the Bible, how are we going to, just humanly speaking,
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:38.180]   how are we going to grow if Pastor Peter continues to tell us what God says?
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:42.540]   I mean, that's not very attractive, but that just kept coming.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:45.020]   And for some strange reason, the church kept growing.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:50.140]   It just kept growing, and then at some point, we were able to actually buy a building.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.740]   And that's what you referred to as Airway.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:58.740]   Airway was the first building that we had, and we actually, no more renting, we bought
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740]   a building.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:08.980]   Airway is a mile from, no, I'm sorry, a quarter, about a mile from where we are right now.
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.740]   It's just up the street.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:17.420]   But I remember thinking our first Sunday at Berean Community Church at Airway, I had this
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:22.020]   very distinct memory where I'm looking at you, Pastor Peter.
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:30.260]   I see the sign, I see the sign, and I look at you, and I say to you, "This is Berean."
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:34.260]   You just kind of like do that smirk, you know, you just kind of smirk, and I'm like, "Yeah."
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.860]   And then, you know, we just do the same thing that we've always done.
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:44.140]   You know, you tell us what the Bible says, you preach it, and then we apply it in our
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:50.300]   lives, and we learn the Bible, we absorb the Bible in our own quiet times, we're exhorted
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:56.940]   to do that, and we just, that's been the same thing we've been doing since day one, and
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.060]   we just continue to grow.
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:06.740]   And I remember thinking when we're at that, at Airway, this is so great, and then we end
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:12.180]   up having to rent, because we grew, we end up having to rent the next door facility a
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.180]   little bit after that.
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:17.900]   And I remember thinking, well, we're never going to leave this place, but we ended up
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:20.260]   outgrowing that too.
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:26.700]   And then we ended up here where we are, on South Mitchell.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.700]   South Mitchell is our first building, we bought that.
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:34.820]   I remember thinking, this is bizarre.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:35.820]   How is this happening?
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:40.060]   How are we getting an even bigger building?
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:43.900]   More and more people are coming, but you're not changing your message.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:47.860]   You're still preaching about sin, you're still telling us what the Bible says, and more and
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:50.180]   more people are coming.
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:55.340]   That trajectory hasn't really changed, well, it hasn't changed at all.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:22:01.380]   And now, I asked the leaders to come in to do this podcast, because now we bought this
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.900]   other building.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.060]   We just came into this other building.
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.900]   Our anniversary is coming up in a couple days, right?
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:16.460]   And so it's strange to see, but there's still one person who hasn't said anything yet.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:19.020]   And that person is Pastor Nate.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.380]   You came here about three years ago.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.780]   You're actually the only pastor who wasn't bred.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:26.780]   You're not a bred Berean.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:27.780]   Homegrown.
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:28.780]   You're not homegrown.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:34.380]   You actually came from the outside, and we were suspicious about you.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:39.220]   Well, just me, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:43.360]   You had a relationship with your friends, your current wife, Kezia, oh, sorry, your
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360]   wife.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   I don't know why I said that.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.360]   I don't know why I said that.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360]   I'll just leave that on there.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.860]   We're not going to edit that out.
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:52.860]   That's a blooper.
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.820]   Your wife, Kezia, yourself, my wife, Diane, you guys are all friends at UCSD.
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:00.460]   We actually had dinner before you even came to Berean Community Church.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:04.780]   So when I heard you were coming to Berean Community Church, I was happy.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.060]   I was really happy.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.940]   But you've been here about three years.
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.220]   Three years is still a significant amount of time.
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:12.580]   Can you tell us about that?
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.580]   You come in.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:14.580]   How did you come in?
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.580]   What changes?
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.300]   How has your experience been?
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:25.780]   I mean, the church that I was at previously was the church that I grew up in.
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:26.780]   I was a kid there.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:27.780]   I was a youth student there.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:33.660]   I went to college, and I went back to that church.
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:38.460]   So with all of that, that's one of the things where nothing's going to replace that church
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.460]   for me.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.180]   I love that church.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:45.580]   That still feels like my family.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:46.580]   There was a family church.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.580]   It was an immigrant church.
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:52.920]   And so there were a lot of older generations there that saw me grow up.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.740]   And so, yeah, that won't be replaced.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:24:00.500]   So when Kezia and I, we were, well, I was approached by Pastor Mark one day.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:04.820]   I thought we were just getting lunch, because I thought we were just friends.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:11.500]   He wanted to kind of ask and poke around and see what I was thinking concerning just future
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.180]   and things like that.
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:21.000]   And so me and my forever wife, Kezia, I went back home to her and talked with her about
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.660]   like, "Hey, is this something we can think about and consider?"
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.500]   And one of the interesting things is, I mean, God had already been taking us through a lot
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:36.860]   of things, causing us to pray a lot about where we are and what we want to do and how
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.700]   to be faithful to Him.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:45.420]   And we wanted to give it some time, but we instantly, it was weird, it was like an instant
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.980]   grieving period.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:51.500]   Like almost like, even though it wasn't like even officially like extended to us, it felt
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:52.500]   like, "Whoa."
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:59.180]   Because I've been offered different job positions before, but this one felt very different.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:03.620]   And so, anyway, long story short, I know this is getting a little long here, so.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:04.620]   No, it's good.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.620]   It's good, though.
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.620]   It's okay.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:07.620]   Okay.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:13.620]   Just to make it short, we decided to come, and right away, like, I started asking a lot
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:14.620]   of questions.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:18.460]   I was trying to, I was poking around with a lot of people, trying to learn about the
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.460]   church.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.640]   I was on Facebook a lot, stalking people.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:30.060]   I found the, you know, the video of you commanding people about how to eat sushi and how to order.
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:34.340]   And then we got here, and I was wondering, "How has this church been functioning?"
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:35.340]   You know?
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.700]   Because, like, "Wow, there are only two pastors here."
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:44.100]   And we had five just on the EM, on my old church.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:53.500]   And I saw a church where a large, a large portion, a majority of the church serving,
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:58.060]   being enthusiastic about Bible study, and those kinds of things were really cool to
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:59.060]   see.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:04.060]   From, as an outsider at that time, like, and I hope that, like, all the Bereans listening
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:09.980]   to this, don't forget what an incredible blessing that is, you know, to be at a church that's
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:10.980]   like that.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:11.980]   I think it's easy to forget.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:15.460]   Man, that's encouraging.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.020]   That's really, really encouraging.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.100]   And Kazee and I instantly felt fortified, like, in our souls and our hearts when we
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:22.340]   got here.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.700]   We felt the warmth.
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:28.620]   It didn't take very long to say, like, "This is our church."
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.020]   So that was pretty quick, you know?
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:37.740]   So yeah, I mean, the three years here, so, so blessed, so privileged.
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:46.260]   I think one of the things is to see the, like, when we talk about what like-mindedness is,
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.820]   there's the theology and the hermeneutic.
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:52.780]   There might be some gasps that go around, like, I come from a Presbyterian church, you
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:53.780]   know?
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.800]   But I'm in no way Presbyterian.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.060]   And so, like, even that, just like the theology and the hermeneutic, it alleviated a lot of
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:03.980]   the pressure and the tension I felt at my previous church.
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.780]   I'm not afraid to say that, you know?
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:11.540]   Even if, like, somehow my previous church people listen to this, they know.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.600]   But more so than that, the heart, a desire, like, when we say things like, you know, to
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.900]   have a high view of God and a high view of His Word, lots of people say that.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:28.060]   But to feel it and to see it practiced, to see what it's like to have a leadership that
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:35.300]   is unified in that, that has the same heart, that desires the same things, that's been
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.340]   the best thing.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:41.300]   I've learned so much from the pastors and the elders here.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:47.420]   And so, like, in the three years, it's probably been, like, aside from, like, the early years
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:52.660]   as a Christian, like, the biggest growth on a personal level.
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:55.820]   And so, yeah, that's just kind of where we are.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.700]   And I think Kazia and I are in the same place with that.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:03.700]   - Yeah, you know, it's been, like, great having you, Pastor, just to see what you did with
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:09.200]   the college ministry, you know, just to see the college ministry thriving.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:14.140]   And you know, now you're going on campus, you know, it's, you know, we know how late
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:18.780]   you, you know, hang out with them and then you wake up before the sun rises to come to
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.460]   these leaders meetings on Saturday.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:26.100]   But you said something interesting, I just want to clarify for everyone that's listening.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.700]   When you came, there were two pastors, right?
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:33.580]   But we just talked about Pastor Peter Chung being here from, being here full-fledged at
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:34.580]   least in 2005.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:39.460]   Pastor Peter Chung, you go to China for a little bit and you end up working with Compassion
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:43.900]   International, which is a mission organization, which a lot of people sponsor children through
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.900]   that.
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.980]   You were with Compassion International for how many years?
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:52.180]   - It's actually a child sponsorship organization that's run like a missions agency, but for
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.180]   about six.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.180]   - About six years.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:29:00.740]   - A little over three years in China, six years in Korea, so it's about a decade.
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:05.120]   - And when you finally come back to, to Berean Community Church, you're not coming back because
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.260]   we've offered you like a pastoral position.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:10.060]   You're coming back for different reasons, but you just want to come back to your home
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.060]   church.
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:12.060]   Is that, is that right?
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:18.980]   - No, no, we, at that time he wanted to come back and so we, yeah, no, no, no, no.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.780]   So we did offer him at that time.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:21.780]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:24.220]   I mean, ultimately what it was is we had no plan to come back.
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:30.100]   We were going to be in Korea for the long haul, but just my father just asked us, like,
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.800]   can you come back?
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.740]   And it wasn't a hard decision for us to make.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.820]   And so just to honor my father who was living by himself, we just decided we're going to
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.340]   go back.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:46.400]   And for me, as soon as I made that decision, I was like, there's nowhere else I would want
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.940]   to go in terms of church.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:51.700]   And so I gave Pastor Peter a phone call, just said, you know, I'm coming back.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.620]   I don't really know to what capacity.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:58.940]   And if you guys don't have the ability to like, to support me, that's fine.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:01.840]   I can find another job and actually just come back and work.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:06.300]   Or if need be, I can, there are other churches that have sent out feelers, which that's not
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.300]   going to be a problem.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:10.660]   But the only place I wanted to come back to was Bahrain.
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:15.540]   And so, and you know, every, every time we'd come back from Asia, this was home.
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:23.660]   And so, yeah, and so you, you know, we have Pastor Peter, Pastor Mark, Pastor Nate comes
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.820]   on board.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:28.740]   But as soon as Pastor Nate gets integrated, I mean, there's enough work to go around.
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:33.700]   I mean, we're, we were hemorrhaging at two pastors, we're hemorrhaging less at three
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.700]   pastors.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:35.980]   You come in, what year is that?
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.100]   This is March 2018.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:43.220]   Officially, I started April, the April, like just a week later.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:50.020]   Yeah, and so it, it's interesting because, you know, we're all back here today.
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:53.540]   And you know, we, we kind of, you kind of went your separate ways, but you ultimately
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.540]   came back.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:59.340]   You know, it's, it's, it's like God had this plan for you, you know, and then you came
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:02.700]   back here and then now you're here pastoring.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:06.140]   And you know, as everyone knows, you had a cancer scare.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.860]   You had a, you had a huge cancer scare.
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:13.380]   I remember thinking just, I can say this now, but I remember thinking, is he going to pass
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:14.380]   away?
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:16.180]   I'm so mad at him because he's going to pass away.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:19.980]   I remember having this thought that I was mad at you, you know, even though it's obviously
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:26.460]   not, it's outside of your control, you know, but praise God, you know, that has gone well.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.520]   That is, that has gone extremely well.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:35.740]   So you come back March 2018, the church has continued to grow.
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:41.440]   You know, we've, we've had shuffling around of, of, of, of different affinity groups when
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:44.540]   we had to.
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:51.240]   But one thing that I can say, I'm speaking for everyone here is nothing has changed.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.340]   Nothing has changed.
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:56.580]   It's study the Bible, do what it says.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:32:01.380]   That's I'm quoting Pastor Peter, study the Bible, do what it says that that was, that
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:02.380]   was it.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:06.260]   So if, if there is something that we have to consider, we have to think about, let's
[01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:08.660]   go to the scripture.
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.660]   Something else is coming in.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:13.260]   YRR, Young, Restless, Unreformed, Gospel Center Movement.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.580]   Let's go to the scripture.
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:16.980]   CRT, let's go to the scripture.
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:22.900]   We know we're pounding the, the necessity, the sufficiency, the authority of, of, of
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.260]   scripture.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:28.420]   And you know, what's interesting is you don't know what God is going to do with that.
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:33.100]   You know, you can be faithful and a church could grow or the church could shrink because
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:34.100]   you were faithful.
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.540]   That, that's, that's not up to us.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:37.540]   Right.
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:43.420]   And I'm thankful because that continues to be our mission that just continues to be our
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.420]   mission.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:48.780]   I know for all of us, if it wasn't, none of us would be able to handle it if that wasn't
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:49.780]   our mission.
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:55.420]   You know, you know, we're, we're coming about an hour and 30 minutes here.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:59.940]   I can, I can continue to talk as everyone knows.
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:05.700]   But I'm, I'm thankful that we were, I'm going to ask for, for any closing comments here
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.700]   in a second.
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:09.620]   But I'm really thankful that we were able to do this.
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.540]   I gathered the leaders here.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:16.740]   I thought it was opportune because we're, we were getting this new building and on the
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:19.660]   outside, you know, things look great.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.900]   Things look glamorous on the outside.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:30.540]   And we're striving during a pandemic, but we need to never stray from what we're doing.
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:35.740]   If we dwindle because we're teaching the Bible, then, then we dwindle, you know, and I'm,
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:40.060]   I'm thankful that that mission has, that we've never strayed from that mission.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.780]   If any, you know, we've only just continued to pound that even more.
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:48.300]   And I think that, you know, it's important to, to remember, you know, I, I've, I've known
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.860]   these stories for a while now, but I wanted to share that.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.460]   I want to share all these stories with the church.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:00.220]   And believe me, there are a lot of other stories that we were not sharing.
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:06.860]   This isn't meant to be an exhaustive recollection of the history, but an anecdotal narrative
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:12.860]   one, because I wanted the church to kind of see where we came from.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:18.140]   Not to highlight, not to highlight the men, although there's a healthy tension that you,
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:25.780]   you should respect those who are ahead of you because God is glorified in that, not
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.740]   that you should worship them, but you should respect them.
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:30.140]   And we're called to do that because God is glorified in that.
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:36.620]   And I wanted that to be achieved, but number two, I want to highlight the work that God
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:41.620]   has been doing, that the work that his spirit continues to do.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:46.540]   And if that means in the future that we grow smaller, then it means we grow smaller.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:53.060]   But at the same time, when, when God has placed a church and he has given the conviction to
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:35:00.060]   teach the word no matter what, I want that to be passed down to the entire church, entire
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.100]   generation.
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:03.860]   If you think we have some kind of formula, that's not it.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:07.100]   That is not, it's just study the Bible, do what it says.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:13.260]   I want to kind of go around and just ask anyone if they have any kind of, any closing thoughts,
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.860]   any closing comments before I kind of wrap this episode up.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.020]   Yeah, I have one.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:26.140]   You know, as one of the, if not the longest member here, I feel like I'm the most, the
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:32.220]   beneficiary of that because I've seen pretty much everything in the context of what God
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:33.220]   has been doing.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:40.820]   So, you know, my appreciation for God and this church is deep with all the experiences.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:50.620]   So in essence, that as most of us continue to strive and serve and attend this church,
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:57.620]   that convey, that may be conveyed that God is the one who is building this up.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:06.180]   Yeah, you know, I think about that time when I did come on to the pastoral staff, like
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:10.660]   I felt in that first moment, like a massive weight.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:16.140]   I didn't realize how much like weight it would cause, but feeling that the weight was so
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.140]   heavy.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:21.880]   And if you remember when I came on to the staff again, there was also Alex and Henry.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.500]   And then around the same time of the plant, Henry went up with the plant, Alex went out
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:28.860]   to China for missions and things like that.
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:34.260]   And I remember distinctly the elders saying to the church, "Hey church, we're not just
[01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:39.660]   hiring people to do the work because the building up of the church is a responsibility God has
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.260]   given for us as a community."
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:48.980]   And so for me, like I feel that, again, you said everybody has stories.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:53.380]   I feel like really our church has invested into the building up of the body and they
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.380]   have stories.
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:58.940]   They tell stories about the building project, late small groups, they tell stories about
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:03.420]   youth group ministry, college ministry, you know, and so in my mind, as I think about
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:09.060]   again, like just now tracing through the history, you know, so many different hands and also
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:18.820]   people's heart and investment into the body, I'm just super grateful, you know, so.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:28.100]   My closing thoughts was, I guess, being the shortest here, three years, coming from a
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:32.540]   church that I had been at for so long and now hearing from the perspective of people
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:37.420]   who have been at this church for so long, it's a reminder, I think, to all our church
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:44.540]   members who are listening that it's easy when you're at a church to be critical just because
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:47.540]   that's how we are, you know.
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:53.700]   But being here for the last few years, there's just so much to be thankful for and many times,
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:59.940]   I think the spirit of division comes when we have a critical heart rather than a unified
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:05.380]   heart that desires to strive together for, you know, the gospel for His kingdom.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:10.500]   And so I'm thankful to be here and I hope everyone listening is too because we're very,
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.180]   very blessed.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:20.780]   Yeah, my closing thought is, you know, we're just the leaders here and pastors reminiscing
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:28.780]   back to how the church got started and what had happened, but there's also many who have
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:33.540]   just, you know, been with us for a very long time, who have really contributed to the growth
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.940]   of the church, the health of the church.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:43.060]   Even though your name is not mentioned, you know, what we're talking about here all encompasses
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:51.500]   every member and I could name multiple people who have really made Berean what it is because
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.280]   there's a certain culture.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.660]   And when I go out and I talk to people, they come and they say, "Your church is so nice,"
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:02.940]   you know, and there's a culture of, I see, of small groups.
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:09.580]   Even though that we might not even have a set like discipleship, but discipleship is
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:13.620]   happening at our church, you know, because you could see it.
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.300]   And I think that's been the culture of our church.
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:20.940]   Even though we might not have ingrained a certain, you know, "Hey, this is what we're
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:28.620]   going to do ABC," but I think at Berean there is a culture of reaching out, doing discipleship,
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.100]   one-on-one meeting, you know, things like that.
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:37.260]   And I think that's what I appreciate and there are many people who are doing that, nameless,
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.900]   been doing that and serving the church that contributed.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:43.620]   It's not just the pastors, not just the elders.
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:48.060]   So that's what makes Berean, I just want to emphasize that.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:52.900]   - For me, Elder James, you just, you mentioned, you use the words cancer scare, but for me,
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:59.500]   I think from the very beginning, the moment I found out this, you know, about the diagnosis,
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.700]   I actually was filled with a lot of gratitude, thinking like, "Oh, this is good for our church."
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:07.340]   And that was one of the first thoughts I had, "Well, this is so good for our church, this
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.340]   is timely."
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.900]   And this is pre-pandemic, but it's like, "Oh, our church kind of needs this, it needs one
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.020]   of us to be sick."
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:18.700]   And so, and that was, you know, with the possibility, okay, I might not make it more than a year
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.620]   or two, but that hasn't changed.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:27.740]   And I think one of the things that I've seen our church, one of the things that I benefited
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:31.900]   from is, man, we were the recipient of so much love and support over the course of the
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.980]   14, 15 months.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:40.420]   And I think those 14, 15 months, we got a minimum of two meals a week, at least one
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:45.940]   letter mailed in the week, just, and you have a whole slew of text messages, phone calls,
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.740]   and stuff like that, and people praying.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:52.260]   And so I think that's kind of like a lot of the strength of the church.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:57.220]   I mean, that's, I'm a beneficiary, as much as I am one of the shepherds of the church,
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:41:01.860]   I'm a beneficiary of just the church body.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:04.860]   And so I don't think I would ever call it a cancer scare.
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:10.620]   It was a divinely ordained avenue for growth.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:14.180]   And I'm so thankful for that, and for the church, and how everything played out that
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:15.180]   way.
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:19.420]   And so, and I think my tune would be the same, had I taken a turn for the worse.
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:24.860]   But yeah, I think by God's grace and kindness, and the help of the church, the whole 14 months
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:28.060]   was very smooth, and almost easy.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.060]   Amen.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:33.580]   Well, I just want to thank you, James, for doing this.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:37.740]   And again, you know, obviously, most of the stories that we've told are stories that we've
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:43.580]   told, you know, many times, and I know, you know, like all the stuff that we've shared,
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:47.620]   but I think just kind of sitting here and going over and reminiscing, kind of reminds
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.700]   us of God's hand and His faithfulness through all of it.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:57.260]   And like you said, every time we grow a certain point, people ask me like, "Oh so what are
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.260]   you doing?"
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.260]   And it's like, "I have no idea."
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:02.580]   Because we've never been here, I've never run a church of 700 people, I've never run
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:05.340]   a church of 400 or 200.
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:09.340]   Like you tell me how to lead a small group, you know, of 20 people, like I've done that
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:10.340]   for years.
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:13.340]   But like 700, if we get to a thousand, I've never been there.
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:15.900]   Like what is the church going to look like at that time?
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:23.340]   And so, you know, like my philosophy has always been like when I first came I felt so overwhelmed.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.940]   You have to get a psychology degree, you have to get a business degree, you have to be the
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:33.060]   top theologian, you have to be the best teacher, you have to be the most caring and gentle.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:37.280]   And so you have to be all things to all men, and you really have to be good at that.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.280]   So I felt overwhelmed.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.260]   Like I don't know if I can do this, right?
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:48.020]   And then it was kind of like hitting that frustration, I don't know if ministry was
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.020]   meant to be this way.
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:53.260]   I don't know if that pressure is coming from God or it's just the way that we do ministry
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:54.260]   now.
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:55.260]   You know?
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.860]   And you look at God chose like fishermen who do nothing and started with them.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:00.940]   It's like why has ministry become so complicated?
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:06.620]   You know like we have to get, like the businesses have a ten year plan, five year plan, and
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.060]   we're going to do this and that.
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:12.280]   Not that there's anything wrong with that if you're gifted in doing that.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.900]   So that's why our ministry to me is very simple, right?
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:22.060]   Like I can read the Bible and I can do my best to teach it and I can apply it, right?
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.660]   It's very simple.
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:27.460]   And then whatever happens then, if you happen to be gifted in certain areas you'll be gifted
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:28.460]   in that.
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:31.580]   So that's kind of how I function day to day, you know?
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:34.180]   And that's how I don't get overwhelmed.
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:35.180]   I can't do that.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:38.940]   If you say you're not good at that, I say good, I know that better than you do.
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:39.940]   You know?
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.700]   So I'm just going to do what He told me to do, which is preach the Word in season and
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:45.700]   out of season.
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.700]   And whatever happens, happens.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:52.020]   Then I'm so thankful for the, you know, new staff that was added.
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:57.500]   Thank you for you and the elders and you know, to me, like what I enjoy the most about the
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.940]   church is the leadership.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:03.140]   You know, whatever's happening out there, as long as we're united, as long as we're
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:08.780]   on the same page, it doesn't seem that, you know, that difficult because we're handling
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:10.020]   it together.
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:11.020]   You know?
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:14.140]   Earlier part of the church obviously that wasn't the case, but now, you know, and that's
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:19.540]   why I think like adding, whoever gets added to this, to me it's not just somebody to come
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:21.460]   in and take some of the responsibility.
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:22.460]   That's not how I see it.
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:27.980]   You know, I see whoever is being added is like, we're getting married to this person.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:30.500]   You know, you have to be, you have to enjoy being with that person.
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.900]   You have to be able to trust that person.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:37.780]   You know, you have to have confidence that we're on the same page, you know, not 100%
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:42.140]   but enough where like that's the guy I'm going to run to and that's the guy, and I'm the
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:46.660]   guy he's going to run to if he needs help and I feel like we have that here.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:50.780]   You know, I know Pastor Nate, the only person that came from the outside, you know, so very
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:56.660]   thankful for him, you know, that he came in and obviously, you know, added to our church,
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:01.060]   but him coming has opened the door to make me think, is there another Nate out there?
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:06.260]   You know what I mean, maybe, because we never even entertained that, but obviously God has
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:11.260]   other people that God can use, whether it's a lay person or whether it's a staff coming
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:16.300]   to church, that God is raising up other people and that kind of caused me to kind of like,
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.980]   okay, maybe going forward, you know, that is a possibility.
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:25.660]   But again, more than anything else, I'm very thankful, you know, like I actually enjoy
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:30.380]   coming to church because I'm around guys that I, you know, not only feel comfortable with
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:32.780]   but feel like we're sharing our lives together.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:35.300]   So I enjoy Saturday morning.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:36.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:37.300]   I'm up anyway.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:38.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:46.100]   You know, we, one thing that we all agree on is that there is, there's absolute like
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:47.100]   love here.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:48.860]   You know, there's absolute love here.
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:53.500]   And you said it before Pastor Peter, when we disagree about something, it's a disagreement
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.500]   amongst brothers.
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:58.300]   It's a disagreement amongst brothers, right?
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:02.340]   And you know, we, we come out of it united, we come out of it united.
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:07.380]   And that's, I, this is the only church I've really been at my adult life.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:09.060]   So I don't know if other churches have that.
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.100]   I'm assuming they have that.
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:13.180]   But all I know is that I love it, you know?
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:15.460]   So Pastor, can you, can you pray for us?
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:17.980]   And then we'll, we'll end the episode.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:23.620]   Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you so much for just over the years being so faithful
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:24.620]   to us.
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:27.140]   Lord, we are your servants.
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:32.260]   And as you told us, even, even thousands of years ago to your people, to not turn from
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:36.900]   your word to the left or to the right, that we may meditate on it day and night, that
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.900]   we may be successful and prosperous in all that we do.
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:45.100]   I pray Father God that that truth would continue to carry on, not just for our generation,
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:48.560]   but even to our children and our children after that.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:51.860]   And I pray Father God for continued unity in our hearts.
[01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:56.100]   I thank you for all the different people that have been here from the beginning, for the
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:00.940]   new people that you're bringing, Lord God, adding to the community that we have.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:05.500]   And we don't know what you have in store for us in the future, but we pray that our love
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:09.140]   for you and your love for us, Lord, would be at the foundation.
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:10.940]   And so we pray for continued grace.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:16.540]   We pray for continued unity and just asking, Lord God, that your purpose of why you planted
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:21.460]   the church, Lord, that you would find fruit in us, that in this dark world, Lord God,
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:27.100]   as people are striving in darkness to look for life, help us, Lord God, to point them
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:34.900]   to you, and that as you have given us resources and even this building and even the leadership,
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:39.900]   help us, Lord, to bring more people to you, that during the time that we have on this
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:44.500]   earth, that we would truly be spent, Lord God, bringing people to you, to love you,
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.980]   to honor you, to save them from their sins.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:52.100]   And so we ask that you would cause a great renewal and revival, Lord God, and that we
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.500]   would use the foundation that you've laid in this church for the sake of your glory.
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.460]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:58.460]   Amen.
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.460]   Amen.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:03.740]   All right, Brain, see you soon.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:11.220]   If you've listened to the entire episode, you definitely deserve a cookie, at least
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:12.780]   a sticker.
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:16.860]   All kidding aside, as I said in the beginning of the episode, I hope this helps bring in
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:19.100]   gratitude to our God.
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:24.660]   I could tell you, despite the fact that the episode was nearly two hours, for us recording,
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:30.300]   the time just flew by for us as we were reminiscing about all that God had done to bring us to
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.300]   where we were.
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:39.740]   And that is the same God that continues to work, that through simple obedience, God will
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:45.740]   build his church and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:54.540]   Because the chief shepherd of Brain Community Church are not the leaders, but is Jesus Christ.
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.780]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:00.860]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:04.820]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:06.660]   James Hahn out.
