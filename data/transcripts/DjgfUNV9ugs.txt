[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   I am so excited, I mean, I was just thinking, this is a gift, this is a gift, this is a
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:26.280]   gift that we are all here together, and to be here for the glory of God, and to be here
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.800]   to just communicate together, to share the journeys that we have been on, and to share
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000]   how God is walking with us every step of the way.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.280]   And so I'm going to, I have a lot to share with you about the journey that I have been
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.720]   on, and Tajine asked me to just give a little bit about where I've been, and how I got to
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.520]   where I am, and I show this, one, because I love the beach, and I reside in Wisconsin,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.720]   and if you know Wisconsin, there aren't many beaches in Wisconsin, so I, whatever moment
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.880]   I can, I try to get to a beach, and you know, the reason I put this up in the Spike Awards
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.240]   for Philippians, being confident in this, that he who began a good work in you will
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.040]   carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.320]   I grew up in a Christian home, with Christian parents, Godly parents, my mother reminded
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.560]   me of this first, when I was going through a difficult time, I loved the church growing
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.280]   up, but I walked away from the church during my undergraduate and college years, which
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.600]   I think many people do, but it was honestly the worst thing I could have done at that
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.160]   time, but when I was done, and I realized my mistake, my mother reminded me of this
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.080]   first, and said, "God has got you, he's got a hold on you, and he's going to complete
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.000]   his work," and so this is just a good reminder for all of us, just what Mark had told us,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.520]   that whatever you're facing, God's got this, and if you don't believe this, you're going
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.480]   to burn.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.080]   And as I mentioned, I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin, in a Christian home, Christian
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.200]   parents, went to a parochial school, and I just loved the church from a very early age,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.040]   I loved scripture, I even thought at the time I wanted to be a pastor, but it just, that
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.760]   family was a God-planned, especially where we are now, but I loved the church, and I
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.520]   loved Genesis, learning about how God created every single one of us, and how we were made
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.680]   in his image, in his likeness, and then he reminded Noah of that, when he set forth his
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.200]   new covenant, written, "If God has God made man," and I just always was fascinated with
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.800]   how God created us as humans in his likeness, it is profound, it is profound how then Jesus
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.520]   came in human form, in the form of a baby, and it's just, it's remarkable when you think
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.520]   about it, and I also loved science as a child, and I, you know, I loved nature, and I loved
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.800]   studying God's creation, but I was like this little girl, I was trying so hard to look
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.000]   through that microscope and see God's creation even in more detail, you know, because it's
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.480]   beautiful as it is, but I wanted to understand it, and of course, the things that came with
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.000]   the microscope kit that I had when I was eight years old, which is, you know, you can barely
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.760]   see anything with it, you know, like the wings of the bee, and the, you know, the feathers
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.200]   that they provided in the kit, and I was like, ah, this is just too boring, I want to know
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.840]   what's going on inside us, how God created us as human beings, so much to my parents'
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.760]   chagrin, I actually would poke my finger, and take the blood and put it onto the microscope,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.560]   little did I know that this was just not a high enough power microscope to be able to
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.840]   see anything, but it just, it's a good reminder to me of just how I've always been, God has
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.800]   placed it on my heart, just this interest and desire to just really dive deep into how
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.880]   he has created us to be fearfully and wonderfully made, and so I knew I would be involved into
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:17.600]   the sciences, and so I, you know, so I proceeded to go, oh, oh yeah, can you hear me okay?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.560]   Yes, oh, that's so much better, could you hear anything that I said before this?
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:32.800]   Okay, good, so I proceeded to go and get my education, I received a PhD in bio, I received
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.440]   an undergraduate degree in biochemistry, and then PhD in biochemistry, and then I decided
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.480]   to do a postdoc in molecular and cell biology at Harvard Medical School, and it was an amazing
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.860]   experience, I learned so much, and then I came back to Wisconsin, where I joined the
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.360]   faculty at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Children's Hospital, and the goal was
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.840]   really to understand at the most molecular and cell level how we were created, and I
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.960]   was really fascinated with heart development, and so my lab was focused for about, you know,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.300]   20 years, my career, over 20 years, my career has really been focused on understanding disease,
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.720]   so I kind of toggled back and forth between how do you detect disease, so in the field
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   of pathology, and then how do you try to fix it in surgery, so I kind of toggled back and
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.120]   forth between pediatric surgery and pathology in my training, and I was so fascinated with
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.960]   how God had designed the heart, and how it was one of the first organs to develop so
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.280]   early on, just 18 days after fertilization, the heart just started to form, and it was
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.120]   that very precise and intricate need for DNA being expressed at the right time, at the
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.780]   exact place, so that those cells could do exactly what they were supposed to do at the
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.640]   right time, and if that didn't happen, then some kids would develop congenital heart disease,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.240]   so that was really what we were focused on, and not only trying to understand the disease,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.920]   but then I directed a lab to try to understand, well, how can we even detect the, at the molecular
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.960]   level, at the DNA level, how can we detect the cause of the disease, so then these parents
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:26.640]   knew what was going on, and then the surgeons knew how to fix it.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.200]   But then what happened while I was, you know, so engrossed in my studies, God blessed me
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.240]   with an amazing husband, and we tried to have children of our own, and suddenly I was faced
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.920]   with having a problem physically, we were suffering with infertility, and not knowing
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.960]   how to fix it, and we were told at this one appointment that we had a less than 2% chance
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:07:00.320]   of getting pregnant, we were just beside ourselves, we were distraught, and we headed down this
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.080]   road, this journey, that I know, that was full of fear, like, oh my gosh, how, you know,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.320]   this was our plan, to have all these children, and now it's not happening, and there was
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.680]   so much pain on this journey, in a very short period, probably about five years, there was
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.080]   a journey of immense pain, because we were struggling with trying to get pregnant, and
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.320]   it wasn't happening, and we prayed, and we prayed, and we did whatever the doctor told
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:34.520]   us to do, and then we suffered miscarriages, and then I prayed some more, and God, I felt
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.760]   like Hannah, he answered our prayer, and we were blessed with a child, named Jonah, who's
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:46.000]   10 now, just such a blessing from above, but through that experience of incredible pain
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.040]   through the losses, and joy in seeing my son, inside the womb, and then outside the womb,
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:01.040]   the same human being, it was just, it was incredible, but then we suffered another miscarriage
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.320]   after that, and so, it was like this roller coaster, of up and down, up and down, and
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.240]   I just was searching for answers, like, why would God allow this?
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.120]   And he just placed on my heart, Psalm 139, so thank you, I can't imagine a more beautiful
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:23.540]   introduction to my talk, and I'm going to just repeat these words, for you created my
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.520]   inmost being, you knit me together in my mother's womb, I praise you, because I am fearfully
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.760]   and wonderfully made, your works are wonderful, I know that full well, my frame was not hidden
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.880]   from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.720]   the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body, all the days ordained for me, were written
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.960]   in your book, before one of them came to be, and it was like the Holy Spirit just placed
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:55.600]   on my heart, I am creating, these are my children, I am creating them, and I know the moment
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.160]   when they are created, and I am the mass, I am hand crafting each child, and just like
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.360]   it says, I ordained, all the days are ordained, and he decides, he decides when it's time
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.160]   for them to come home.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.640]   And it was just such a wonderful comfort, but then at the same time, while I felt like,
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.720]   you know, God had really been holding me and walking me through, you know, my husband and
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.680]   I through these very difficult experiences, at the same time, I was also looking around
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.400]   and seeing what was happening in our institution.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.080]   And I was seeing how so many, you know, I had just, I felt like, God had opened my eyes
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.960]   to how wonderful his creation was of every human person, and how he, everyone is so unique
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.800]   and creative for a purpose, and then I saw, almost on a daily basis, how so many around
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:55.760]   me in the world were not seeing that, and these little innocent ones were being destroyed,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:03.560]   and they were being neglected, and they were even being used for research.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.640]   And God convicted me.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.960]   He said, stop using the gifts I have given you for myself, and my own selfish desires,
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.200]   and now to use them for his glory and his kingdom.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.080]   I had to lay everything down at his feet, including the desire for more children.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.640]   And that's a whole other story for another day.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.400]   And so I started to speak up when I saw things happening and the institution doing things
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.320]   with much fear and trembling, I will say, and when godly friends, when I was able, these
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.800]   are some of my friends here were testifying here in Wisconsin, that was one of the first
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.560]   things we did, and then God had plans for me to testify in many different states and
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.720]   even go to Washington, D.C. and testify in front of Congress.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.280]   But it came to a point where I was doing this and trying to do my job where God called me
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.320]   to step down from my academic position, and I said, really, God?
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.040]   You know, this was the goal, and then he reminded me, no, that was your plan.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.240]   This is my plan.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.320]   I want you to step down, and I took a year off.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   People thought I was crazy.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.680]   I mean, when I told my chair that I was just, I was taking, I needed to step down, and I
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   was going to, he said, well, what are you going to do?
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.080]   I'm like, well, I'm actually not sure, I'm going to let God tell me, but that year was
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.320]   a gift from God because I was able to really dive deep into scripture and really work on
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:33.600]   my relationship with him and spend time with my son and just really, and I knew he was
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.280]   calling me to, he was calling me to something different.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.640]   And he reminded me of this from 2 Timothy, that whatever lie ahead, that for God did
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.960]   not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love, and of self-discipline.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.600]   That power that is inside of us is that same power that rose Jesus from the dead.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.160]   Jesus is alive.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.600]   He is with us, and whenever we are facing struggles, he, his Holy Spirit is there to
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:11.120]   be our helper through this, and that power is perfected in weakness.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.840]   And the weapons that we fight with are not the weapons of the world.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.400]   On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds, and I feel like I'm
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.940]   reminded of this, and God places this on my heart.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:27.920]   We demolish arguments and every pretense that sets itself up against the knowledge of God.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.400]   God has created these little ones.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   He is the creator.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.680]   These are his children, and that's the message that we tell.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.600]   And so God has really opened doors.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.240]   I thought what was, you know, when God put it on my heart that he was changing my career
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.320]   and he had new plans for me, door, he opened this door to the Charlotte Lozier Institute,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.440]   which is a nonprofit organization that is located in Arlington, Virginia, just outside
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   Washington, D.C.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.160]   I work remotely from Wisconsin.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.000]   It's such a blessing to be able to work remotely, and I just travel as needed.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.320]   But we, our goal is, we are not a Christian organization, but we are Christians, and we,
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.260]   our goal is to use, to promote a deeper public understanding of the value of every human
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.180]   life from the moment of conception until natural death.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:24.080]   And so we use science and statistics to help people understand, and this, and for the glory
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.420]   of God.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.480]   And so, you know, human life begins at conception.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.600]   This is a scientific fact.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.520]   But we also know that this science-confirmed scripture in Jeremiah, "Before I formed you
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.800]   in the womb, I knew you."
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:46.720]   This I'm showing you here is just a beautiful image of the beginning steps of conception
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   before the sperm and the egg fuse.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.120]   And centuries of science, I'm going to just give a little bit of history here.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.900]   Centuries of scientific discovery and technological advancement have provided indisputable proof
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.480]   that from the moment of conception, when the sperm fertilizes the egg, there is a creation
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:10.220]   of a new, totally distinct, integrated organism, a human being, a person, biologically distinct
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.400]   from any other form on this planet.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.820]   And the dynamics of fertilization are well established.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.940]   I'm showing you here what's called the Carnegie Stages of Human Development.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.500]   These were first developed in, these were first established in 1942, have since been
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   expanded.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.640]   But they remain the standard used by all biologists to describe the first embryonic period of
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:37.620]   human life, which is going to be the first, actually, eight weeks since fertilization,
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.620]   or 10 weeks gestation.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:45.900]   Because just a reminder that there's two different ages that you can, that you can explain pregnancy.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.420]   I'm going to be going from gestation, just because that's what most women hear when they
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.220]   go to the OB.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:58.160]   But just that earliest embryo there starts off as a zygote, a one cell.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.380]   And that's going to grow to nearly 1 billion cells by the end of the 10th embryonic week,
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.620]   the stage 23.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:12.260]   And will become a fully then developed adult, like us, containing 30 to 40 trillion cells.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.220]   And what's amazing is by this 10th week, you can already see that that little one already
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.540]   has fingers and toes.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.060]   What's amazing is that God has designed this child that, that by this stage, that baby
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.340]   already has 90% of its body structures.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.300]   The adult is predicted to have 4,500 body structures.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.440]   By this stage, they already have 4,000 of those body structures in place.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.860]   It's remarkable.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.500]   So what kind of cell has been produced at the sperm-egg fusion?
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:44.460]   Right there, that first one, which is actually the very first stage of the Carnegie stage.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.100]   Is it a new human being, or is it simply a human cell?
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:53.020]   I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty details of fertilization.
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:16:00.220]   I'm going to encourage you, if you're interested, to look at this paper by Maureen Condick.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.980]   She's a professor at the University of Utah, but she has dove deep into this of when human
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.980]   life begins.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.780]   And she provides the scientific evidence, if you're interested.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.700]   And she identifies 26 key events that start with fertilization through the first week,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.420]   and documents every single stage.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.420]   It's fascinating.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.540]   But I just want to read what she has from this paper, that it is clear that the zygote,
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.120]   or one-cell human embryo, forms immediately upon sperm-egg fusion.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.180]   The embryo does not function as a mere human cell or group of human cells.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:34.940]   It functioned as an organism, a complete human being, at an immature stage of development.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.020]   So it's basically just-- it's no different that zygote is just another name for the child,
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.020]   right?
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.700]   So you have-- we call it an infant, a toddler, a teenager.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.580]   The zygote is just the earliest stage of the human being.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.860]   And I also want to point out this paper by O'Reilly and Mueller, where they say prenatal
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.940]   age begins at fertilization, postnatal age at birth.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.340]   So further confirmation.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.500]   And then even, if you want even more evidence, scientific consensus on when a human's life
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   begins.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.300]   So this was a PhD student.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:13.260]   His thesis was on, what do people-- what do other people say about this?
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:20.140]   So he surveyed about 5,500 biologists at over 1,000 institutions in 86 countries.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.180]   Over 95% of them were PhDs, and over half of them are non-religious.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.940]   And the majority of them say, yes, human life begins at conception.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:35.340]   And so I just think it's remarkable that not only do we see that in scripture, do we read
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.060]   in scripture, but science confirms that.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.300]   And we're now going to, like-- I want to walk you through this journey of what happens from
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.060]   fertilization, because it's fascinating.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.540]   And when I was in my mother's womb, this is what my mother saw.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.820]   I mean, you can barely pick out the ultrasound scan.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.300]   You barely pick out the head of the baby from the 1970s.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.060]   So I think God has graced us with the technology of ultrasound.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:05.780]   And that just within the last 50 years, there have been remarkable improvements to be able
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.980]   to see what is actually happening to these babies inside the womb.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.780]   Because now you can see modern ultrasound, these babies, you can see them with absolute
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   clarity.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.340]   Barely you could pick out the head with the black and white grainy dots.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.300]   Now you can see the facial features.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.660]   You can see every facet of that baby.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.300]   And that's not even to mention the behaviors.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.700]   A baby at this stage is going to be sucking his or her thumb and is already going to have
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.180]   a preference for whether they're right or left handed.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.180]   It's remarkable.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.320]   I mean, and there's studies that have shown that, that whether they use their right or
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.940]   left hand, that then follows what happens after birth.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:50.700]   And so we thought it was so important that, you know, God has provided so much information
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.620]   through ultrasound and through science of what's happening, you know, his beautiful,
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.740]   it's like a window into the womb.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.860]   And so he, you know, to show us how wonderful his creation is of these little ones.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.580]   But we know that a lot of these papers and science are behind firewalls.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.180]   And it's hard for people to get access to them and everybody is really busy.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.900]   And so we really wanted to, we were fascinated by it.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.340]   And we wanted to make, we really felt called to bring this, I know Ty Dinea has used this
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.340]   word accessible.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.100]   And I think that's so important, because we wanted to make this accessible to people and
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.620]   to show them the beauty of God's human creation inside the womb.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:33.140]   Because modern medicine tells us more than ever before about how we are wonderfully made
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.300]   by our creator.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:47.740]   So I'm going to next I'm going to show you a video that we made that's on our website.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:20:11.580]   And I'm going to put the development down to one minute.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:24.380]   And it's just beautiful.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.460]   It's beautiful how God's hands shaped and made all of us.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.640]   I mean, we so we use that medical artwork that is accurate based on the most up to date
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.420]   information that we have to just show that and we want to share this journey with you
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:45.780]   this voyage that God has a sign and I want to talk about, you know, I want to talk about
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.900]   how we are creative for a purpose how and how God's awesome creative and awesome design
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.580]   is that we are each unique and I'm reminded of Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:02.260]   created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.820]   in them.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.740]   We are all created for a purpose and every human being is created with a purpose has
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:13.140]   intrinsic value and worth and God designed each person to be unique and magnificent from
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.100]   the moment of conception everything that defines us in our uniqueness.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.940]   I mean, we can get into like how the environment affects things, but we know that our uniqueness
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:28.300]   and our genome is present right from the moment of conception and it is nothing short of a
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:33.300]   miracle and what's amazing is that there is enough genetic variation that again no two
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:37.340]   humans are going to be the same or ever will be even in the case of twins.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:45.660]   So how can that be why I want to go back to we knew that DNA was important in defining
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.420]   our uniqueness as human beings.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.220]   But what science can you know, it's science again confirms what the Holy Spirit revealed
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.100]   to King David 3000 years ago when he wrote Psalm 139 we are literally knit together in
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:05.780]   our mother's room because DNA is when it was the destruction was discovered in 1953.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.620]   It was described as actually two ribbons of genetic material woven together.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.140]   It's just like that tapestry that Mark was talking about and when Watson and Crick who
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:21.980]   discovered this in their in their best-selling book later Watson later claim that Rick Crick
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:28.220]   announced that discovery by walking into the nearby Eagle Pub and blurting out we have
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.740]   found the secret of life.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:36.300]   They knew they knew that discovering the structure of DNA was key to understanding
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.740]   the remarkable uniqueness of each one of us.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.740]   Well, why is that?
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.740]   Well, because DNA is in some respects like the blueprint of life.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.900]   Every living thing has its own unique genetic information or DNA code based on the same
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:56.580]   four nucleotides A C G and T and it's all contained within each of our cells compacted
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:04.220]   into the nucleus of every cell and the cell is going to be like the it's like a little
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:10.340]   machine kind of but it basically is going to be the function of how we are going to
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.340]   function and how everything is going to develop inside our body.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:20.660]   And so although only you know one generated human genome sequence is shown for the purpose
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.980]   of the application in fact reality we have two genome sequences right one from mom and
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.180]   one from dad.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:33.140]   And they estimate that just one of the sequences is going to be about three billion nucleotides
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.140]   each copy.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.840]   So we have each person has six billion nucleotides.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.140]   It's amazing.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.940]   And if all that so I'm not a math person but there are really amazing math people like
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:49.580]   you all that have determined that if the DNA in the adult human body is unraveled like
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.860]   a string that it would exceed sixty three billion miles in length which is comparable
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.900]   to three hundred and forty round trips from the earth to the sun and back.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:05.620]   And when estimating the number of different types of people that can be created it has
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:11.460]   been determined that any male and female can produce over eight million offspring that
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.580]   are each genetically unique.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.580]   Nobody's going to be having I don't think eight million offspring but it just shows
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:23.260]   that the probability of there being two identical children from any two parents in the population
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.100]   is six point two billion to one.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:32.780]   So that just shows how God has just engineered this with such preciseness that we are all
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:40.900]   so unique from the very down to the very DNA that is in each one of us and is in ourselves.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:47.340]   So the human genome is again packaged as I mentioned into each of these cells and it's
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.740]   we need to have two chromosomes again one from mom one from dad I'm showing you here
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.100]   what's called a karyotype so these are actually the chromosomes and you can see that the chromosomes
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.140]   we have twenty three chromosomes twenty two of them labeled one two twenty two and then
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.300]   our sex chromosomes x or y if you have an x y you're going to be a male if you have
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.860]   x x you're going to be a female and this is going to be determined from the moment of
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.300]   conception whether you are male or female.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:15.780]   And you can see here just just all of these chromosomes contain all of the DNA that is
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.940]   in our bodies that are complete genome for life.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:26.140]   And what happens is that this DNA is packaged in the cell very tightly but it's going to
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.900]   be unraveled at just the right time.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.220]   This is where the precise nature of God really really shows that it's going to be unraveled
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.740]   at just the right time to activate these genes that are kind of like that are going to then
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:45.660]   give rise to proteins that are going to perform the many cellular functions and are going
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:51.220]   to define then who we are as human beings and and you're going to produce the more cells
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.220]   and more tissues and organs and be the human being that we are.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:02.500]   But it's just it's it's fascinating that there that this dogma of DNA going from DNA to RNA
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.980]   and then to protein is what defines so much of how we are so unique.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.180]   And what's amazing is that you think OK well the genome is estimated to contain about twenty
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.220]   to twenty five thousand genes you say OK well that's that's actually that's kind of a lot
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:21.300]   of genes but but then you think OK but what's amazing and what I'm showing you here is that
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:26.340]   the DNA is on the top so you can see the DNA is there's what's called exons and then those
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:32.700]   exons are kind of like the so if you look at it like a recipe OK so that those are going
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.780]   to be the you have a cookbook is the DNA and then the recipes are going to tell you like
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.520]   how to bake a cake right.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.780]   Well this is like a recipe for how to make proteins that are going to be again they're
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.860]   going to tell the cells what to do.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:50.220]   But those those coding regions like the recipe part can be shuffled around and you can with
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:56.480]   one gene in some cases you can make up to 100 different proteins just from one gene.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.860]   And so it's just this starts to show just how we dive deeper and deeper into more variability.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.180]   And this is just also showing a structure of protein and how again it's kind of like
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.900]   a ribbons like together and just beautiful intricacy.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.860]   And so what's in what's interesting is that people are so fascinated with understanding
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.460]   well what is the sequence of the genome for every single human being.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.100]   Because in order to do that we can understand what kind of what does make us more unique
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.400]   and how are we different from each other.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.100]   And so that's been a big push from the Human Genome Project is to actually determine the
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:36.540]   sequence of all six billion nucleotides and what's the order of that.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:44.220]   And now then in 2022 there was actually gaps in that though with the first draft in 2001.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.380]   But then in 2022 they tried to fill in some of those gaps.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:52.300]   And now the new human pan genome is going to try to look at more different races to
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.060]   really get a good feel for what type of what is the sequence.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.820]   Because the more you understand about the sequence the more you can hopefully understand
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:06.800]   about a how are we uniquely made but also how can we maybe identify disease.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.740]   And so but what they're finding so far with the information that we have is that human
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.360]   beings are about ninety nine point six percent identical or point four percent different
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.820]   from another person.
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.420]   So just that point four percent difference.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.620]   I mean that's that's why we look different.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.820]   That's why we act different.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:30.140]   That's why we you know we just it's just different hair color different eye color different diseases.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.300]   It's just different functions.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.780]   It's just it's remarkable but it all in many respects comes down to point four percent
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.660]   difference when it comes down to the genome.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:43.580]   I'm just going to very briefly give you a molecular 101 science lesson about what are
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.260]   some of those differences.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.540]   But you're going to hear something called like single nucleotide variants.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.260]   So throughout the genome there are sprinkled some variants.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.140]   And so what's showing you here is that they can just at one spot in the genome.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.500]   Let's say person one will have a C on one strand and a T on the other.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.380]   But person two will have a C on one strand and a C on the other and person three will
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.660]   have a T and a T. So you can see how there's this genetic variability that is based in
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:16.060]   just at the very subtle and most of these are non-disease for me but they can have dramatic
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.860]   effects of who we are as a person and even like how we respond to different medications
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.100]   and such.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.940]   There's large structural variations in which you can you actually can see that when you
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:33.380]   look at the chromosomes that parts of the chromosome will actually be deleted or they
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.180]   will be duplicated or they will invert from with each other.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.460]   You will have insertions or even translocations where one part of the chromosome from like
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.500]   chromosome four will go on to chromosome 20 and then vice versa.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.780]   And so it's just it's really fascinating.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.900]   I also want to show you that you can have smaller like what's called duplication.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:30:00.260]   So in this case people have been looking really hard at this gene called Notch 2NL.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.540]   It's like alphabet soup when you look at all these genes and what they name them.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.980]   But this one they're particularly interested in because it is unique to humans.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:13.460]   And this one has been specifically been shown to play in a critical role in brain development
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.520]   and they're finding that in people that have more copies of this gene they have bigger
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.140]   brains and if they have less copies of this gene they have smaller brains.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:27.940]   And this can actually be some causation for some of the disorders we see with brain microcephaly
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.220]   or macrocephaly.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.860]   So it's really quite fascinating.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.820]   So now we're going to kind of back up and I just I want to just pause and say all of
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:42.480]   this I mean that was just a snapshot of the genetic diversity that we have.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.380]   But all of that is present at the moment of fertilization.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:51.060]   Within 40 hours of fertilization then I'm showing you here so right this is a picture
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:58.020]   again of within the first week of fertilization that the cells are going to instantly start
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.020]   to divide.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.780]   All the genetic information is in place.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.020]   We are already unique.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.780]   We are human living human being from the moment of conception.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:10.660]   But now we're going to start to divide our cells and grow all the tissues and organs.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.660]   And so the division starts immediately.
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.640]   So you go from two cells to four cells and this happens rapidly the doubling the number
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   of total cells.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.420]   And I think I want to go back to Psalm 139 where we are made in the secret place.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.460]   Only God knows at exactly the moment when that conception takes place.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.740]   If it happens inside the womb only God is the only one that knows.
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:38.620]   And so these are images of real embryos showing what it looks what the zygote that single
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.820]   cell looks like on day one.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.100]   And that again that single cell zygote is going to become a 30 trillion cell adult.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.360]   On day two again that division occurs.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.700]   The cells just keep dividing over and over.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.500]   On day five the human being is called a blastocyst.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.340]   It's just another stage of development.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.220]   And at that stage that's when it's ready to implant into the mother's womb.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.860]   And I think what's fascinating for those of you that might be interested in in vitro fertilization
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:14.420]   and what happens at day five at this stage this happens outside of the womb for in vitro
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:19.220]   fertilization and it's at this stage then it will the embryo will be transferred back
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.460]   into the mother to see and hopefully implantation will occur.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:29.260]   If there's any doubt that these human beings at day five are not a real human living human
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.900]   being I encourage you to look at this page.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:33.900]   It's called nightlight.org.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:39.500]   They are involved in embryo adoption or if you've heard of snowflake babies.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:45.540]   And these are babies that were all the result of embryo adoption after in vitro fertilization.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.220]   And these embryos were adopted out and they have names.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.700]   They have faces now.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.180]   But before that when they were adopted they just had numbers.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.700]   So this was embryo number 41.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.700]   Now she's Ella.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.000]   And it's just it's a remarkable reminding that we are human beings from the moment of
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.780]   conception and even at that five day stage just how remarkable seeing the human beings.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:16.100]   And so at that stage then at the five day stage then that's when implantation is going
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.100]   to occur.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.460]   And so I'm showing you here medical artwork showing that blastocyst in the mother's uterus
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.820]   and then it's six days after fertilization the early embryo will begin to implant in
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.660]   the uterus and the outer cells in the blastocyst have what's called a special sticky molecules
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.100]   that will help the blastocyst bind to the wall of the uterus.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.420]   And what's fascinating is that the embryo is now in this permanent home in his mother
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.420]   and will stay there until it's ready for birth.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:48.380]   So then week five now this is now that implantation has occurred now we have nutrition that's
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.740]   coming from the mother.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.620]   The inner cells of the embryo are going to now form three layers of tissue.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.180]   So now we start to see the body plan forming.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.540]   So the top layer is going to be the skin the nervous system and the eyes and the ears the
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.940]   middle layer is going to contribute to the muscles the bones the kidneys and the reproductive
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.080]   system and the inner layer contributes to the baby's lungs and intestine just to name
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.180]   a few.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:18.060]   So it's just it's amazing that just so soon after the embryo is developed that we already
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.300]   see the body plan start to occur.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:29.020]   And just six weeks after the baby the baby is developing we're going to have the first
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.500]   heartbeat whoops let me go back.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:43.060]   And so this is I have to wait for it I have to be patient.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.060]   There we go.
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:50.220]   So here you are seeing by photoscopy a real beating heart of a baby in the six week gestation
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:55.060]   which is again four weeks post fertilization so the baby itself is really only four weeks
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.100]   of age.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.900]   But it's just fascinating.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.780]   It's you can see the blood is pumping in the heart at just this early stage.
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.220]   And this again is the first organ to form and function in the heart.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.700]   It's a vital source of circulation and nutrients and oxygen carrying blood and especially once
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:16.020]   the nutritional requirements the embryo can no longer be met by diffusion of the placenta
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.980]   alone that's why we need the heart to form.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.340]   So these are just some interesting facts about heart development.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.100]   You're going to see at the on the far left that's the heart tube.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.140]   That's where the early primitive heart is going to start to beat.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.780]   It beats just 22 days after fertilization that again is in the sixth week and not only
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:42.600]   is it beating it's beating rhythmically at 110 beats per minute by the end of that week.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.020]   Just a couple weeks later it's going to be at 159 beats per minute.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.580]   By the ninth week it's going to be twice the heart rate of the mother's at 170 beats per
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.400]   minute.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.620]   By the end of the sixth week it will have already beat 1 million times and it just keeps
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.040]   going on and on from there.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.180]   The same heart will beat 54 million times before birth and over 3.2 million times into
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.980]   adulthood and what's important is that the heart rate is so important at this stage for
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:11.820]   any of you who have been pregnant or have seen an ultrasound you know that the heartbeat
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.820]   is the sign of life and when they they look for the physician looks for the heartbeat
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.620]   and they because they know that if they see a heartbeat that that baby has a high chance
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.940]   of surviving to childbirth as high as 98% in some cases.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:31.540]   And so I started heart valve development when I was in Boston and so I find it just fascinating
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.940]   that these heart valves, you're seeing here a picture on the right of an adult heart valve,
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:43.140]   these leaflets are like they are so thin they're like these little like paper thin even thinner
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:48.660]   than paper they're so delicate and they open and close to ensure that the blood is pumping
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:55.060]   in the right direction and even at this early stage at six weeks there are already these
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:59.780]   primitive heart valves that are in place that prevent the backflow of the blood through
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.380]   the heart tube and assist in the forward propulsion of the blood through this baby to make sure
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.500]   that the blood is pumping and the nutrients are getting to the baby so that the rest of
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.820]   the organs can now start to develop.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.700]   And one of the next organs that is very important and is going to develop is the brain and so
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:22.460]   we see here the different stages of brain development throughout human development and
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:27.180]   what's amazing is that the brain is going to undergo complex and lifelong changes and
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:31.660]   so some of the most important stages of brain maturation occur during development, early
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:37.540]   childhood and adolescence and actually it's not until about age 25 when our brain is fully
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   developed and fully functional.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:44.740]   So it kind of explains some things you know maybe so but it's just it's an important fact
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.940]   and I want to you know a lot of times with the heart too people will say well that's
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:55.380]   not a real heart at six weeks because it's not four chambers yet but I remind you that
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:05.220]   life is a continuum right we are always in some form of development we are either developing
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:11.900]   function or honestly losing function so it's it's just it's fascinating that that God has
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:18.660]   engineered it that we are continually continually developing and our systems are maturing it's
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.660]   incredible.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.620]   And so I'm going to start kind of see how we're doing on time okay so I'm going to start
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:29.120]   moving through and showing you some this is a real image this is a real picture of baby
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.740]   inside the womb these were images that were very generously provided by the Center for
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:39.740]   Bioethical Reform Greg Cunningham's group and it's just remarkable to see the little
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:48.100]   one here as early as week nine brain as we showed earlier brain activity is is really
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.580]   is really exploding at this point so we can see that the embryo starts to move and respond
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.620]   to touch the embryo's heart as we said now at this stage the heart started beating at
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.900]   six weeks but now by nine weeks now all four chambers are in place and we see that there's
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:07.980]   already pockets of cells that resemble taste buds on the on the tongue the eyelids are
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:13.020]   already formed the knees and elbows appear the toes start to form and the tissue between
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.820]   the fingers become thin and so you can notice how the knees and elbows are forming and the
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:24.980]   neurons and I think it's it's just it's remarkable we know that brain activity has actually has
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:30.220]   already been recorded at this stage it's just it's remarkable and there's even ultrasound
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:36.340]   recordings has also shown that the embryo can actually hiccup at this stage so now by
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.460]   10 weeks and if you remember back to those Carnegie stages that I showed you this is
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:45.140]   the stage where we see that they have 90% now of their structures the fingers and the
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:50.420]   toes and the digestive system are fully in place the toes can actually wiggle this is
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.660]   where the embryo can show preference for the right or left hand they've already they can
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:40:00.340]   detect electrical activity of the heart that resembles that of a newborn the embryo can
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.540]   actually bring can bend his elbows and bring his hands together and can also roll over
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:12.420]   with the amniotic sac squint grasp and point his toes and when the embryo touches his face
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:17.820]   he will frequently move his head away and so the the embryo can even make intermittent
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:25.420]   breathing motions which is just remarkable by week 11 we can see that this at this point
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:31.940]   the embryonic period is done and the the baby is called a fetus we can see external genitalia
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:37.700]   start developing tooth buds are developing more complex behaviors are seen such as thumb
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:43.700]   sucking swallowing and stretching and now there's an explosive growth of the brain growing
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:51.600]   over 250 neurons per minute and once the preborn baby starts moving he doesn't sit still so
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.780]   reachers researchers have actually quantified fetal movements and they found that the fetus
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:01.620]   does not stay still for more than 13 minutes at a time and by 11 weeks the nerve receptors
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:06.540]   inside the fetal skin can sense light touch so if anything lightly tickles the sole of
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.540]   the fetus's foot the fetus will bend his knee to withdraw his foot and may even curl his
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:16.840]   toes so by week 12 we see a dramatic growth spurt you can tell I don't know if you've
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.940]   been monitoring you know watching the centimeters on the bottom but I think it was only a couple
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:27.260]   a few centimeters and now we're up to you know six centimeters from crown to rump and
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.320]   and fingerprints and fingernails are developing I mean the fingernails will start to grow
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.680]   and the fingerprints have already started to form and it's remarkable just how even
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.060]   subtle you know the fingerprints are going to start to form and it's going to be even
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.380]   just that environment within the womb that is going to play a direct role into what type
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.040]   of fingerprints that child develops and again that by 12 weeks the fetus will respond to
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.120]   light touch now on the face the palms of the hands it's just remarkable we've actually
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:01.260]   put together 12 amazing facts at 12 weeks I'll just talk about a couple of these but
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:05.980]   you can go to our website and see them but all major organs have formed by now the four
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:12.540]   chambered heart is pumping over six quarts of blood per day each finger can move separately
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:18.360]   the fetus has a face the teeth are developing and the brain connections that are formed
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:25.740]   at 12 weeks will survive into adulthood so it's just it's remarkable by 15 weeks this
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:33.740]   is the the big stage when we start to see pain and stress response so it honestly if
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:38.700]   you go back this is fascinating literature there was a time when they thought that that
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:44.900]   newborns didn't feel pain I mean which is just and then there was then the literature
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:51.100]   started saying well no they they don't feel pain until after 24 weeks and and Dr. Stuart
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.380]   Dubochard was one of the world's leading neuroscientists he actually published a major study saying
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:01.540]   that he's like no pain doesn't start until after 24 weeks but then now with all the evidence
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.660]   you know when are the receptors actually forming on these children when and now with ultrasound
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:11.980]   we can actually see them respond to pain the weight of the new scientific scientific evidence
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:16.780]   is so strong that he changed his view and he published a recent report that says no
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:22.200]   you know what unborn babies I was wrong they can experience pain by 15 weeks and possibly
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:27.660]   as early as 12 weeks and what they thought was that the cerebral cortex was not needed
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:32.180]   to feel pain and that's not the case evidence is showing that it actually a functioning
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:37.700]   cerebral cortex is not required to feel pain and so what's even more and I'll talk about
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.860]   this a little bit later in my talk but actually they do fetal surgery now and they use anesthesia
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.780]   specifically for the baby because they know that the baby can feel pain and this is just
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:52.900]   an image of a baby that's sitting comfortably inside the womb about ready to have fetal
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.220]   surgery to correct a defect so you can see sitting comfortably and then you're gonna
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:05.620]   see the response once they received an injection in their thigh of anesthesia and so you it's
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:11.340]   just remarkable just you know not only do we know it scientifically at the receptor
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:17.060]   level we can see it in their face they are feeling pain and this is for anesthesia this
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.300]   is to give them the anesthesia so that they won't feel the pain so you can see just the
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:26.180]   cutting 40 ultrasound images and how much more information we have now about these little
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:31.660]   ones by about this stage you know about you know 16 weeks we start to see all the sensory
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:37.100]   systems and sensations are in place touch taste hearing vision smell and pain I'm not
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.620]   going to go into all these details I encourage you to go to a website to get more but it's
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:46.300]   just when you see how God and just the preciseness like all of this is happening just at the
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:52.800]   right time in the right place by weeks 19 and 20 we can see that the baby is starting
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.820]   to actually practice activities that he will do outside the womb such as breathing and
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.620]   crying and the rooting reflex vocal cords are developing in a pattern that they will
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:09.380]   see in crying after birth it's just it's remarkable weeks 21 to 22 again you know the inner ear
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:14.620]   has developed they can start to hear they can start to hear their mother's voice just
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:20.060]   a couple weeks later it's just respond to taste there's actually studies that have shown
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:25.500]   that if the mother eats a cookie versus something bitter the baby will drink more of the amniotic
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:31.820]   fluid because they already can strongly taste and they know what they like my son to this
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.980]   day now I know why he I felt kicking every time I ate a banana because this day he hates
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:43.540]   but to this day he hates bananas oh I thought bananas were good for you now I know he actually
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:50.140]   was very unhappy every time I ate one and so that you know I'm again I'm really there's
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:55.540]   a lot going on six seventh eight nine months we see again response to sound in light there's
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:46:02.580]   an amazing photography of where you can see the the baby actually putting a hand kind
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:09.680]   of towards the the mother's uterus at the end of uterus in response to light sleep patterns
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.460]   brain growth and lung maturation and of course then labor and delivery and new beginnings
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.940]   will happen about nine months but I want to just back up because we do have a little bit
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:25.340]   of time I want to talk about just the technology that God has graced us with in saving these
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:30.620]   tiny babies because we know that you know in many cases women carry babies for nine
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:36.460]   months and then deliver but we know that life doesn't always happen as we planned it and
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:42.500]   I think through this incredible gift of technology God has reminded us the humanity of these
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.940]   little ones inside the womb as and and just I'm going to walk you through some of the
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:53.220]   amazing things that are happening to remind us of just how how beautiful these babies
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:59.460]   are so there have been so much technology happening within the last three decades to
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:05.940]   not only to save extremely premature babies so for various reasons some babies might be
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:11.660]   might women might go into labor early and so medical advances have now made it possible
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:17.500]   to save these extremely premature early babies at early and earlier stages so once you know
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   about 50 years ago viability was about maybe 24 weeks you could see that they were born
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.980]   these babies could survive now that clock just it's an arbitrary point of like now because
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.820]   of when viability is because now we're seeing because of modern science that some of these
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:38.780]   babies as early as 21 weeks gestation that's just about a little over halfway through gestation
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:47.180]   are surviving so this this little boy is Curtis Means he was born in July 2020 he was born
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:53.700]   at 21 weeks in one day 132 days premature and he is on record as he broke the Guinness
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:58.780]   World Record and so it's just remarkable just how what can be done to save these and because
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.620]   of that hospitals many American hospitals now have started offering the resuscitation
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:12.100]   and the active care for infants born at 22 weeks I now want to just talk about whoops
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.860]   not only can you save babies outside the womb but as I mentioned earlier with fetal surgery
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:22.300]   just the technology to save babies now inside the womb so what you we wrote a paper on this
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:27.260]   if you're interested but what you're seeing here and it's just it's his name is Samuel
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:33.980]   Armis on the left that's a famous picture it's called the hand of hope one of the earlier
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:39.380]   earlier reports of which they actually did surgery to repair a defect inside the woman
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:44.140]   you can see his little hand there they literally bring the uterus out and you can see the baby's
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:49.540]   hand because he crafts he he he grasped the surgeon's hand in process and they they had
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:54.660]   a photographer there to take the picture it was remarkable and here's a picture another
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:59.620]   fetal surgery in which you can see the little foot right there and Children's Hospital of
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:04.140]   Philadelphia reminds us because they do many of these surgeries that the average size of
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:09.400]   the organs operated on during fetal surgery is is about a half an inch so it's just remarkable
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:16.500]   how they do these and to see the amount of growth in in in surgery in 1997 so it's chopped
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:21.380]   us so many of these surgeries but in 1997 that was it was new and so they have a fetal
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:26.220]   family union to get together and celebrate that these babies survived the surgery inside
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:32.820]   the womb and I want to point out too that this surgery can happen as early as 15 weeks
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.780]   so it's just remarkable but you can see how much it's grown I mean they had just like
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.500]   a handful and they were in the lobby but now in 2022 just last year they now had to go
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:48.300]   to the zoo to celebrate the thousands of babies that have been that have been saved it's remarkable
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.000]   and one of the main surgeries that are done you can hear about this in the news all the
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.920]   time is in utero treatment for spina bifida and so this is when that very early stage
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.420]   when the neural tube is forming that will give rise to the brain and the and the spinal
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:07.780]   cord it doesn't close properly the way it should and so it actually it's actually exposed
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:14.180]   to the to the to the amniotic fluid and they need to close that and because it can lead
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:19.820]   to significant health issues for the child and can even be fatal so what they found is
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:24.540]   that you can actually go in and you can repair this wound and it leads to significant improvements
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.020]   for these children not only do they survive but they actually have a much better quality
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.700]   of life and they can walk and actually this study was so powerful because it actually
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:37.940]   showed that that they actually stopped the study early because they said well wait this
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:44.260]   is this is amazing how let's just stop the study and offer this to all babies they also
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:50.000]   do laser therapy for twin to twin transfusion syndrome so this is where it's a serious and
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.060]   life-threatening condition for both babies caused by an abnormal connections and blood
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:59.620]   flow between identical twins twins who share one placenta and and so it's fascinating they
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:04.340]   can go in and this they don't even have to open up mom it's just using really tiny fetal
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:09.400]   scopes to go in it's very non-invasive and they can then correct the disorder with laser
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:15.100]   ablation it's it's remarkable we're also seeing congenital heart disease actually going in
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:20.100]   and repairing the baby's heart is now really on the horizon and Children's Hospital actually
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:25.300]   performed one of the first surgeries and you can see this little boy here who is obviously
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.300]   one of the first and he's doing very well in playing baseball we see here Cleveland
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:36.220]   Clinic where they actually performed a rare and complex life-saving surgery to remove
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:42.700]   a tumor that was attached to the heart of a 26 week old baby and it takes just an incredible
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:47.900]   team of physicians and you can see again here they got the picture of him while they were
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:55.020]   doing the surgery the little hand and and then there he is now born on July 13th of
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:52:03.180]   2021 and doing well the most recent one this spring was at Boston Children's actually did
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:09.780]   they repaired a rare fatal blood disorder that occurred in the brain of a child so this
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.740]   was just remarkable that they're actually able to go in and do brain surgery in the
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:19.820]   child in the utero and I think this is just a remarkable story that not only that but
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:24.380]   we actually have what are called adult stem cells that's a whole nother talk but these
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.220]   these that are literally life-saving and so what they found that they can actually use
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:33.900]   a mother's own cells and in some cases the father's cells to actually help to correct
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.980]   blood disorders in these babies so what they do is they collect the stem cells from the
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:44.620]   mom this pregnant and then they basically give them back to the baby in utero it's like
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:50.220]   a stem it's like a blood transplant but inside the womb and this is saving babies with blood
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:56.300]   disorders such as alpha thalassemia it's remarkable and this just reminds me of just that connection
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:01.740]   with the mom and the baby because this paper talks about forever connected the lifelong
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:07.900]   biological consequences of fetal maternal and maternal fetal my chimerism a lot of words
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:15.020]   but basically mom and baby exchange cells in DNA very early on as early as six weeks
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:22.700]   and that lasts for a lifetime so those part of that baby is with the mom not even if that
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:28.140]   child isn't alive anymore they're forever connected it's remarkable and I just want
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:32.940]   to and they're showing that this this is a quote from the paper this intricate exchange
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:38.380]   of genetically foreign cells creates a permanent connection that contributes to the survival
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:45.020]   of both individuals and it's just it's remarkable how God engineered just that connection that
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:51.660]   bond between the mother and the child not only just you know emotionally but actually
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:58.020]   at a very the most basic granular and cellular and molecular level it is just absolutely
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:07.540]   outstanding and because of that fact some people are using that that that that that
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:16.580]   because we know that the baby's blood and DNA and and cells can be found in the mother's
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:23.540]   bloodstream there is what's called non-invasive prenatal testing so they they take advantage
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:29.820]   of the fact that they can they can find the baby's DNA in the mom's blood because there
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:34.780]   are invasive techniques where you can actually go in and like through amniocentesis or chorionic
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:39.660]   villus sampling very invasive techniques and they actually are at risk to the baby but
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:44.740]   now they've discovered that they can just get a blood sample from mom a routine blood
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:52.380]   sample and say okay does this baby have any genetic abnormalities okay they were meant
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:55:00.220]   to be a way to help the baby what we're finding is that a lot of these screens that look for
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:07.820]   rare disorders are usually wrong especially the ones that are most rare I've written about
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:14.060]   this if you're interested it's actually really quite sad because it's becoming kind of an
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:20.660]   arms race between these technologies and I think something that was meant to be helpful
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:27.940]   has really turned to be harmful and so what we're seeing is that babies like Down syndrome
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.660]   I'm showing you the karyotype of them as you remember these are the chromosomes so babies
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:38.620]   with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome 21 that's why it's called trisomy 21 they
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:43.700]   have three chromosome 21 instead of two and similarly there's other trisomy disorders
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:51.060]   like trisomy 13 or 18 in which chromosome 13 or 18 has now three instead of two and
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:58.220]   this I am very passionate about this because I am reminded of Exodus 411 when Moses says
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:04.660]   no I can't go to Pharaoh and God says but who gave man his mouth who makes him deaf
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:10.180]   or mute who gives him sight or makes him blind is it not I the Lord we go back to the beginning
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:15.340]   God created us created us for a purpose we are wonderfully fearfully and wonderfully
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:22.660]   made he designs everything about us he determines what type of DNA we have and he determines
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:28.620]   how long he has ordained every single one of our days and so what's happening is that
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.820]   a lot of these babies once they're diagnosed with these disorders they are not given a
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:40.300]   chance we know that a lot of these babies in some cases up to 70 and 80 percent of them
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:46.860]   are never given a chance to life and they are literally being thrown away because they're
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:54.660]   thought of as not valuable and I want to remind you that even in cases of trisomy 13 and 18
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:57:01.300]   you will often hear physicians say that these are fatal disorders fatal disorders and but
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:05.980]   when you actually look at the science we see that they're they might be life-limiting but
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:12.220]   they're hardly legal or incompatible with life some of the most recent papers show that
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:17.300]   that that there's significant longer-term survival is possible with select patients
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:22.300]   especially receive the right treatment these papers combined show that even if you don't
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:26.780]   do anything some of these babies will live to 10 years of age others if you they offer
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:33.020]   the right interventions especially in cardiac cases they can live anywhere from 11 to 53
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:39.740]   years of age will there be will there be quality of life issues yes but it's just remembering
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:46.820]   that God holds every these are his children he designed them and for however long they
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:53.380]   might live there is always what's called perinatal palliative care and perinatal hospice where
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:59.220]   parents can they receive healing without a cure if there isn't a cure like we've talked
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.780]   about like outside the womb a treatment or if there isn't a treatment inside the womb
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:08.260]   that this provides a safe place for families to meet their child face to face the child
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:13.180]   that they were given by God the gift and to be parents for however long their child may
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:22.380]   survive he ordains our days he ordains everything he is in control and we have put together
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:30.420]   a website called prenatal diagnosis dot org to prove so that parents understand just really
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:36.500]   understand from a from a life affirming perspective just how beautiful every that their child
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:43.460]   is no matter what diagnosis they get and I'm just going to end with this slide God designed
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:49.180]   each of us to be unique we are magnificent from the moment of conception it is nothing
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:55.420]   short of a miracle and God created each one of us for a purpose and we were created to
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:02.900]   glorify God and I love this psalm it's just the most beautiful thing let everything that
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:08.420]   has breath praise the Lord we were created to glorify God and Jesus came into the world
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:13.300]   in the same way as we did with the purpose of glorifying the Father in heaven by conquering
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:20.540]   sin dying on the cross saving sinners just like you and me and I my prayer is that we
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:26.660]   we look at every child the way that God that God created through the eyes of Christ with
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:33.820]   humility with wonder with awe compassion and love from the very moment of conception up
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:39.620]   until natural death when he says it's time so I thank you for your time and I'd be happy
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:44.420]   to answer any questions.
