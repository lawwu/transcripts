[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.140]   - We're back one more time with historian
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.420]   and theologian Michael Reeves,
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.260]   talking about his incredibly good book,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.540]   "Delighting in the Trinity."
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.620]   If you're looking for a good summer read, consider it.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.140]   Dr. Reeves serves as the President and Professor of Theology
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140]   at Union School of Theology in Oxford.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.500]   Last time we were talking about creation,
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.300]   so Dr. Reeves, go into the inner Trinitarian relationship
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.180]   and explain for us where the act of creation,
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.100]   this impulse, where does that originate within God?
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.100]   - Yeah, well, our triangle, the Father, for eternity,
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.460]   well, we looked at John 17, 24,
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.020]   where Jesus says, "Father, you loved me
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.980]   "before the foundation of the world."
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.100]   For eternity, the Father has enjoyed,
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.780]   delighted in his servant, that's Isaiah language.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.300]   He's enjoyed his son.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.020]   And what's happening in creation is,
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.940]   as the Father is so delighted in the Son,
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.940]   so he delights to have that love overflow,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.100]   that there might be many sons,
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.660]   that the Son might be the firstborn of many brothers.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.380]   And so with this God, who's outgoingly gracious
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.420]   in who he is in eternity, eternally loving,
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.500]   it makes sense that he should have many others
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.900]   that he might love.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.020]   Now, if you're a single person, God,
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.940]   that just wouldn't make sense.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.420]   Why would he create?
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.100]   But because the Father has always enjoyed loving the Son,
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.260]   creation seems not an essential thing he has to do at all,
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.540]   but a very characteristic thing for him to do.
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.620]   - Yeah, glorious.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.580]   And all of creation, it flows out of God's abundant
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.140]   Trinitarian delight.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.100]   So I wanna press in here a little bit more.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.020]   You have so clearly made this connection
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.260]   with the Trinity and the beauty of creation
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.820]   in your own life.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.340]   Now, what happens in your mind and in your heart
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340]   as you behold the beauty of creation?
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.180]   I mean, when you see the beauty of creation,
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.900]   you know, mountains, oceans, sunsets,
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.660]   what goes on in your own heart and mind?
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.380]   - Yeah, oh, so many thoughts, so many thoughts.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.540]   One would be, flowing directly out of what we're seeing,
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.060]   is that in creation, I'm not simply seeing
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.660]   the omnipotent power of God.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.780]   And that's something which is true,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.980]   which I think that's the thing that Christians major on
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.500]   when they talk about Psalm 19,
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.580]   the heavens declaring the glory of God.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.740]   That's true, we do see the power of God
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.180]   as how God must be super cosmically powerful
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.340]   to bring creation about, of course.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.820]   But that hasn't explained why he's created.
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.740]   He doesn't create because of power,
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.020]   he creates because of this overflowing love.
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.820]   And so in creation, you see the generosity,
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.860]   the kindness of God.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.700]   He creates in the first place out of love,
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.300]   and he continues to sustain us, even rebels,
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.020]   continues to sustain us
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.100]   because of his ongoing generosity and kindness.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.620]   He places stars there to shine in the darkness.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.740]   He places, I find this so encouraging,
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.580]   every morning, the sun rising and driving away the darkness.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.420]   That's sort of Genesis 1 picture,
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.820]   but also reminded me of Jesus, the light of the world,
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.780]   that I see the purity, beauty, glory of God
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.260]   proclaimed in the heavens as the sun, like a bridegroom,
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.540]   shines and drives out all darkness.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.740]   So that every day I find, just as I see the sun rising,
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.900]   I'm rejoicing to see God isn't, he isn't unkind,
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.820]   he isn't ungenerous, as I might naturally,
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.020]   as a natural idolater think.
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.700]   He's so good, so kind, so generous.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.260]   So by creation itself, I'm one back to praise him,
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.020]   I'm one back to delight in him.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.620]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.340]   At one point in the book, you say,
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.740]   "What we love is more important than what we do."
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.460]   What we love is more important than what we do.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.540]   Essentially, in the Christian life,
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.580]   the affections are central.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.460]   I mean, so, so key to understand that.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.260]   I mean, this emphasis is also reflected in your title,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.220]   Delighting in the Trinity.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.380]   And clearly, by writing this book,
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.540]   you don't just wanna fill minds
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.980]   with good theology about God,
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.940]   but you wanna see hearts
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.820]   that are filled with affection for God.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.740]   Explain why, in your own words,
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.180]   the place of the affections is so key
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.020]   in our understanding of God.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.540]   - Yeah, the affections are so essential to who we are,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.700]   so core in both sin and salvation.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.700]   In sin, you see it,
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.300]   why is it that Eve takes the apple?
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.300]   That the action of her sin
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.580]   actually flows out of her affections,
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.180]   where her heart is, that she desires wisdom.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.540]   She wants to be like God
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.860]   more than she wants to trust God.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.620]   So she's got a love for something else
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.220]   rather than a love for God.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.900]   And that's how sin works in us.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.580]   But the reason I act sinfully
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.260]   is because I've begun to desire sinfully.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.620]   I've begun to desire something else
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.100]   more than I've desired God.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.620]   And this is James 1.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.140]   Desire gives birth to sin,
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.180]   and sin gives birth to death.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.900]   But the same thing, this is how we're built.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.020]   And so the same thing works for salvation.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.340]   I naturally don't desire God.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.100]   I desire myself, I desire other things.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.940]   But what the Spirit so kindly does
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.100]   is the Spirit opens my eyes
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.500]   to see the glory and beauty of God,
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   and so wins my heart such that,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.340]   and here's what I want to do in all my preaching,
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.820]   and I make this very clear when I speak,
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.100]   for example, to students in my church,
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.220]   I want people to see that the living God
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.220]   is more beautiful and more desirable than their sin.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.500]   And that's the Spirit's work through the Word.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.900]   The Spirit opens our eyes that we might see Christ.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.380]   A key verse the Puritans always turn to
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.340]   in their understanding of sanctification
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.420]   was 2 Corinthians 3.18.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.940]   Richard Sibbes made that verse, in many ways,
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.740]   the centerpiece of his ministry.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.740]   And 2 Corinthians 3.18 talks about
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.980]   how we are transformed from glory to glory
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.340]   as we gaze on Him.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.860]   This, by looking at Him, we become like Him.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.860]   We shine like the Lord
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.780]   because we become like what we worship.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.100]   We see how glorious He is, and He wins our hearts to Him,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.780]   and we want Him more than anything else.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.740]   - Amen.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.420]   Delighting in Christ is a paradigm for Christian growth.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.140]   We've gotta see the glory of Christ in Scripture.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.620]   So connect these themes for us.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.100]   I mean, what would you say to those of us
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.860]   who find it to be a struggle in the morning
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.100]   when we approach the Bible, we open up our Bibles,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.540]   we want to delight, but that delight is such a struggle.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.220]   What advice would you have for us?
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.020]   - Well, I think a key thing is to know
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.460]   why are you opening your Bible in the morning?
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.620]   What are you trying to do?
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.820]   And people approach their Bibles
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.980]   with all sorts of different motivations.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.900]   And I confess, I approach my Bible each morning
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.860]   with very confused motivations.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.060]   And so we must know what we're doing
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.980]   as we're opening our Bible.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.820]   Now, it is the truth of who Christ is.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.700]   It is the light of who Christ is
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.820]   that will cause the heat of desire for Him.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.260]   But we must know that this is why the Scripture's written.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.460]   John Calvin put it beautifully
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.660]   when he's commenting on John 15.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.580]   He said, "The Lord has given us,
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.980]   "the Spirit has breathed out these Scriptures,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.220]   "that we might have a hearty affection,
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.380]   "a cordial embrace of Christ."
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.260]   That's the point.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.060]   And so as we open the Scriptures, let's cry out,
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.700]   Lord, let me see your glory, your beauty,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.820]   your goodness, your kindness, your generosity,
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.380]   that I might love you afresh.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.380]   - Well, our time is up.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.420]   And I'll end with this question.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.500]   Our triune God is eternal.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.740]   God existed in eternity past,
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.380]   and that changes how we view creation.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.700]   But God is also eternally triune into the future,
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.020]   and that changes everything about heaven.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.420]   It seems to me the distinctive features
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.020]   of what makes heaven heaven
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.380]   is the presence of our Trinitarian God.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.460]   So fill this out for us.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.900]   What will eternity look like?
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.500]   What's to come?
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.940]   - Oh, what a lovely question.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.940]   Well, it is that the Spirit will eternally be working in us
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.700]   and we will have spiritual bodies, Paul says,
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.620]   in 1 Corinthians 15,
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.020]   by which he means the Spirit,
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.340]   these will be real physical bodies,
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.340]   but animated by the Spirit through and through now.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.180]   And the Spirit's work is, well, he has two works in us.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.780]   His first work is he unites us to the Son,
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.340]   such that as the Father has always cherished the Son
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.460]   and seen him as the apple of his eye,
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.820]   so we're embraced by the Father's love of the Son,
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.900]   and so that we can approach the Father as our Abba,
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.900]   so there's an extraordinary status gift the Spirit gives us,
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.340]   and so we can boldly go to the throne.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.380]   But there's more.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.060]   The Spirit doesn't simply give us the status of Christ.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.540]   He gives us the mind of Christ.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.180]   He turns our hearts so that as the Spirit opens my eyes,
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.060]   I begin to see who Christ is and enjoy the Son
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.380]   as the Father has eternally enjoyed the Son.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.140]   And so I get to enjoy for eternity
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.780]   what has most pleased the Father for eternity.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.780]   But also I get to enjoy the Father as my Father,
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.700]   as the Son has always done,
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.260]   and so I'm brought into this wonderful Trinitarian life
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.580]   of joy and love,
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.060]   and we'll be in these physical bodies
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.820]   in a renewed creation.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.860]   And I think this is where people seem to flip-flop.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.860]   There are some people who get twitchy about the idea
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.140]   that we'll actually have a real earth to enjoy
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.220]   'cause they see, isn't that a distraction from God?
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.580]   And there are some people who just talk about the joys
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.460]   of the new creation, the Messianic banquet and all that.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.820]   I want to say, no, the two work together really well,
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.140]   rightly well, they're designed to,
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.340]   in that we talked about how creation proclaims
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.780]   the glory of the Lord, that through the new creation,
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.860]   we will appreciate the generosity of God more.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.380]   It'll be a part of our ongoing eternal existence
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.380]   that as we live in the new creation,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.780]   we will see the glory of God manifest so perfectly,
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.220]   His generosity shown to us so well
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.380]   that we will delight in Him more
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.580]   and delight in each other too, now perfected.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.220]   So there'll be this Trinitarian life
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.460]   will revel in the new creation,
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.980]   and that Trinitarian life has been expanded
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.460]   to include the whole family of the Father,
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.740]   which means we'll all be enjoying living together with Him
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.540]   as brothers and sisters.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.340]   - That's so good.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.620]   That was historian and theologian Michael Reeves,
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.980]   who serves as the president and professor of theology
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.980]   at Union School of Theology in Oxford.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.780]   He is one of my favorite authors
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.860]   and author of a number of great books,
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.500]   including "Delighting in the Trinity."
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.100]   You'll want to check it out.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.300]   Well, we are back with Pastor John the next two days,
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.180]   and we'll be talking about summer vacations
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.220]   and bikinis and modesty.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.500]   It should be eventful.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I will see you tomorrow.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.620]   Thanks for listening to the "Ask Pastor John Podcast."
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:06.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
