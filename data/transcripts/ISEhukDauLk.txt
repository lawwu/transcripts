[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   As Pastor John Piper finishes up his travels through the Middle East during the month of November,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   we're going back into the archives and re-spreading a few Ask Pastor John recordings from years past.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And back in January of 2010, he was asked to respond to this question,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   "I believe in the doctrine of election, but I don't like it. Is it a sin for me to not like the doctrine of election?"
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Here's what Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   It's sin not to like the true doctrine of election.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   It's sin not to like what God likes.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Now, I would want to say it like that because many people have conceptions of doctrines,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   all kinds of doctrines, that are inaccurate and therefore their good hearts dislike them.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So you could say, "I dislike election," and be a good person because you don't see election clearly.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And what you're disliking should be disliked.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Or you may be a person who is starting to see it clearly and your old self, which is bad,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   is rising up and not liking what ought to be liked.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So I don't know whether this person should be chastised or not.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So the principle would be, to the degree that you see biblical truth clearly, you should like it.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Now, hell is a biblical truth.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So when I say you should like hell, what I mean is the way God does.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   God says He's not willing that any should perish.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   God does not delight in the death of the wicked.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   God afflicts us, but not from His heart, Lamentations 3.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So there is in God Himself a willing that hell be, and liking that it exists in that big picture,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and yet grieving over sending anybody there.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And so the word "like" is just a little bit difficult here,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   because you're going to have to do double perspectives again.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   If God ordains that Jerusalem be destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, should we like that?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And my answer is a yes and no.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We should not like women boiling their children, but we should approve of God's decision that it happen.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And so there's a double perspective in which the things that you see in the small lens should be disliked,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and in the bigger lens, liking that God would run the world this way.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   That was Pastor John Piper.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And speaking of the doctrine of election, Pastor John's latest book is now out.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It's titled "Five Points Towards a Deeper Experience of God's Grace," and it was published by Christian Focus.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Chapter 6 is all about election, and you can download it right now by downloading the entire book as a PDF, free of charge, at DesiringGod.org.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   There, if you click on "Resource Library" and then "Books," you'll find it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   "Five Points Towards a Deeper Experience of God's Grace."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening.
