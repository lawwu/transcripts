[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   All right, Jesse, let's do some books.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Let's do it.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, so these are the five books I read in March 2023.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We're recording this in April, so it still counts,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   even though you're going to hear this in May.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   The first book, a short novel by Stephen King called The Colorado Kid.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   You know where I found this was a drugstore in Clearwater, Florida.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   I was looking for another book to read.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I wanted something more fun. I was in a CVS in Clearwater Beach in Clearwater, Florida.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   And they had a small book section, which was all Daniel Steele.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And then for some reason, they had a hard case crime edition of The Colorado Kid by Stephen King.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   So it's this cool sort of short, it's called an anti-mystery because it's a hard-boiled mystery type novel,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   but they never get to a solution. It's sort of postmodern.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And so you're learning about this case, about this body that washed up on the shore of this small island in Maine.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And there's these two hard-nosed old newspaper men, and they're telling it to their intern, this young woman.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And they're kind of walking through the story, and these clues kind of pile up, and no resolution is reached.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And so it's an anti-mystery, it's kind of deconstructing mystery.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I love that hard case crime. They do this beautiful cover art.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   They re-released all of Michael Crichton's books he wrote under a pseudonym in med school.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   They call them the med school files, the med school books, all his cool covers.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Anyways, it was fun. I read it on the beach and enjoyed it.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I just felt serendipitous. Why would that book, this 2003 release from hard case crime,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   why would that show up in this random CVS? But it was there. And so I felt like it was a sign.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I also read The Unsettlers by Mark Sundin.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   This is one of these books where you have a sort of very literate Harper-style writer
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   who sets out on sort of a personal quest.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And in this case, he goes and spends time with people who live very unconventional lives,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   sort of simple, intentional lives of various types.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And it's him spending time with these people and reflecting on his own life.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So it's part memoir, part observation. And it was kind of interesting.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I bought this book a long time ago and then just took it off my library shelf and read it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And I enjoyed it. He spent time with some people living very simply in Missouri
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and some urban farmers in Detroit, among some others. It was good.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Does it motivate you to get your cabin?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   The weird thing about it, and I think this is just the uncanny valley,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   is that when he was hanging out with other young people, people our age or younger,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   they kind of annoyed you. But when he was talking about the generation before
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   who had moved to these farms or whatever in the 70s, it was fine.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Like, yeah, these people are doing what they're doing.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But when it was other young people, it made me feel a little curmudgeonly.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I mean, I'm Mr. Deep Life, and there were cases where I'm like,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I think you need to get a job. Because there was some of this over-the-top stuff,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   these people that we put on capes and bike around the country to try to raise awareness
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   about bringing together the earth. And some of it felt like there's people super far adrift.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   They didn't go through a Deep Life systematic exercise, I'd say.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   There's a lot of big swings happening.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And so it's just like you feel like some of the young people, I know people like that.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   They always have a big idea, and it's kind of weird.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   But then some of the people are really cool.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   But Mark's a great writer, and it was interesting. It really got me thinking.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   But it was that book that led me to my next book, which was Living the Good Life by Helen Scott Neering,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   which we did a whole deep dive on a few weeks ago.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I forgot exactly what we called it. Simple Life or something like that.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   But I read that after The Unsettlers, and this was the same idea,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   like Helen Scott Neering leaving Manhattan and moving to this farm in Vermont and homesteading.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   But because they're Depression-era people, they're not people you know,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and then you can come at them with an objective remove,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and it's much more easy to find aspiration and draw an example out of them.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So anyways, that book was cool. It was written in the '50s, and I did a whole deep dive on it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So Living the Simple Life or something like that.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So look for that episode if you want to find out more about it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I bought an old version of that. I felt like I needed a... I got the 1974 edition.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Those type of books I like to read in the original editions.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I read a novel, C.J. Box had a somewhat recent novel called Shadow's Reel.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I think I bought this in an airport somewhere. I like C.J. Box.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   His whole series is a game warden in Wyoming, Joe Pickett.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And it's cool. I like the Wyoming stuff. This one's got a lot going on.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Stolen Falcons, Black Lives Matter protest, murderous henchmen seeking stolen Nazi memorabilia,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   which has shown up in Wyoming and ended up in the possession of Joe Pickett's wife.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   All of this happening in the same book. It was fine.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So stolen Nazi memorabilia, that's stuff that the Nazis stole while they were in power and then...
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   No, American G.I. took when they raided the Eagle's Nest, Hitler's whatever.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And I guess there was something, I don't want to spoil too much, but there was a photo album
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   that a G.I. brought home to Wyoming to where Joe Pickett lives.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And it got passed down to his son. And there's something incriminating in there
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   for, I guess, a political leader now in Eastern Europe.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And so he sends these henchmen to Big Sleep County to go get it back.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And they're kind of murderers. They kill a bunch of people.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   But anyways, someone drops it off at the library. Joe Pickett's wife is a librarian,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   so she has it and they're coming to... They're kind of lurking around the house
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and all this type of stuff is going on. It's interesting.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   CJ Box has got into some Twitter... Twitter controversies aren't real controversies,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   but he's moved more... There's more politics in his book.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Like, not super right-wing politics, but right-of-center politics.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And then he's getting pushback, like, "Why is this so right-wing?"
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And he says, "That's Joe..." He's like, "These are the..."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   For a... What's he trying to say? He's saying, "These are the politics of...
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   This makes sense if you were a game warden in Wyoming.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   This is not my politics. This is the politics of the world of the book."
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So he's in this interesting back and forth. I was like, "Wow, this is interesting."
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   There's a whole plot line in here about Antifa.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And in the book, it's all really overprivileged white kids
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   from rich households who are dressing up and stuff and are completely hopeless
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   and are being manipulated by this evil guy who stole the Falcons.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   So it's like a whole plot line, this whole anti-Antifa...
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It's like pro-Black Lives Matter, anti-Antifa.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   All this stuff is in CJ Box. When I think of CJ Box, it's typically like...
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Joe Pickett is... There's been a murder in the woods, and he's in the game warden.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So, I don't know. CJ's going in interesting places.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   - When was it written? - That's pretty recent.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It takes place during... It must take place during...
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   When were all those protests and riots and stuff was 2020, right?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So it had been written after that. I don't read a lot of CJ Box.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I always like the idea of liking genre books, detective books or these type of books.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And I never really have gotten into a series...
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   The last genre writer I really just read everything was Michael Crichton when I was young.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But these new ones where it's like, "Here's the character."
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It's like Hieronymus Bosch and Connelly or Joe Pickett and CJ Box.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And here's the character, and every year there's a new book, and it's this character.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I really love the idea of being really into those, but it just doesn't click with me.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Even the good ones. CJ Box is fine. Connelly is much better.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Michael Connelly is great at this. But I just can't get into...
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I've read some. It just doesn't... I don't know why it doesn't do it for me.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   It's like fantasy. I should like fantasy books.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And I have a hard time. And I blame Brandon Sanderson.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's somehow his fault. I should be a fantasy book fan.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But I don't. I get bored. It's too much like...
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   "Thou as the wizard's staff will smite the dwarf" or whatever.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I should love that stuff. Maybe it's just fiction. I'm just not an accomplished fiction writer.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   How many of the Stephen King books have you read?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I have a hard time with King. Because they're so long.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   All of his good books he wrote on Coke.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's all over the place. It's a really interesting approach, but it's not my style.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   So I like the short ones. The Colorado Kid is great King.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But I read 300 pages of Fairy Tale and finally gave up.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's a very interesting tone. It's very accessible and conversational.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And it just feels too... It's just going and things.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   He's spinning out ideas and doing this and that.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I don't know. It's not my style. I like a tighter thing.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   But I should like Stephen King. I'm telling you. There's all these books I should like.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I did read Name of the Wind. I did actually read all of Name of the Wind. And I did enjoy it.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So kudos Brandon Sanderson.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   For Name of the Wind. I did read that. It was good.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And I read half of the second one and then I sort of lost steam.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I think it's an issue I have with fiction.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   But my last book was also fiction. So I have three novels on my list.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The last one was Haven by Emma Donoghue.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And it's just a novel about the monks who inhabited Skellig Island off of the west coast of Ireland.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So there's this like desolate rock where there's a real monastery that was built on there in the medieval period.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And I saw it. I was out there.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Years ago I spent some time in Dingle on the west coast of Ireland which is real near to there.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And it's a real place, a real monastery. They used it to film scenes from The Rise of Skywalker.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   So like the place where Luke Skywalker is like hiding away on that island, that's Skellig Island.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And so this is a fictionalized, it's historical fiction.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So it's a fictionalized account of like the original monks.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And it just starts inland in Ireland and they sort of make their way out there.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And they try to tame it and inhabit it. And that's the book.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   That was pretty good.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Gotta be cold out there on that island, right?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That's not optimal. Not optimal.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I looked up the reality. So in reality, they used it seasonally for a while.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Like the actual way it turns out is they would raise sheep on it and they would use it seasonally.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It's not far from land.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So the monks would come out there and they would stay on there during the summer because they would keep sheep there.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   But they wouldn't live there full time. They wouldn't live there in the winter.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   They'd come back to the mainland. It turns out to be the reality.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And then at some point they built some more permanent stuff and then the Vikings just...
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   You know how the Vikings do.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It was good. I give it like a 7 out of 10.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   It was like fine writing, not great writing.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   7 out of 10 is pretty good.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Yeah. Not like a great novel, but also better than Shadows Reel by C.J. Box.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So like on the scale, it's...
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   There is no Falcons being stolen or murderous Nazi henchmen.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   That was a pretty good book, but it wasn't my...
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I'm not thinking I got to recommend this to everybody, but I am proud of myself for reading three novels.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Like for me, it's uncharacteristic.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
