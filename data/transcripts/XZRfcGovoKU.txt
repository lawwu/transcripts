[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel in the third chapter and the first three verses.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   The first three verses in the third chapter of the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "Moreover, he said unto me, Son of men, eat that thou findest."
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   "Eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel."
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   "So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll."
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   "And he said unto me, Son of men, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee."
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   "Then did I eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We look once more at what we are told here in the early chapters of this Book of the Prophet Ezekiel at his call.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   We were considering part of it last Sunday morning, and we look at another aspect of it this morning.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Now once more the truth is put to us in the symbolic form and manner that is of course the outstanding characteristic of the writing of this particular prophet.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   But as I was explaining last Sunday, we mustn't be misled by the symbolism.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   We mustn't be troubled by it even.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's meant to convey a lesson in the form of a picture.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And what matters for us, of course, is the message and the lesson which we are intended to receive.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Not only that, it is important, I think, that we should realize that what we are told here about the call of this particular prophet
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   is not something that is peculiar to him, nor indeed to any other prophet only.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It is a more general message that is another great characteristic of biblical teaching.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We are given some very outstanding and notable incidents.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Not that we may draw the conclusion that we are to experience exactly the same in detail.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   No, they are given us in order that they may direct attention in a very dramatic and striking form to a principle that is universally true.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So what we are told about the call of this man is not something, I say, that applies only to preachers.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It does apply, of course, very particularly to them.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But it doesn't only apply to them.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It is to be true of every Christian individual, every member of the Christian Church.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Now, all this, of course, is particularly important at a time such as this.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   We are living in an age when it's no longer the custom for people to go to the house of God.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And that means, of course, that the responsibility of the individual Christian is correspondingly greater.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And, therefore, it falls to us one by one in our ordinary context in life to be representatives of the gospel.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Every Christian is, in a sense, an evangelist.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And the great lesson that is needed today is that we must return to that conception.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Every one of us is to be an evangelist.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And we can be used of God to helping others to come to the knowledge that means salvation and life.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I think, as I speak, of that wonderful example in the experience and the life of John Bunyan.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You remember how, at a very difficult period in his life, when he was convicted and yet uncertain,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   not knowing where he was nor what he believed, he chanced one afternoon to listen to the conversation of three old godly women
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   who were sitting in the sun in the doorway in Bedford.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   They didn't realize he was listening, but he was.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And it was the result of listening to the holy conversation of these women
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   that Bunyan not only received comfort and consolation but also indication as to what he should do.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Thus, you see, these women are known to us.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   We're the means under God of helping to lead that great and mighty and notable man to his full Christian experience.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Very well, then, I say, this is something for all of us.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   We can only do that kind of thing as we are prepared and prepare ourselves in the way that we read of here in the case of the prophet Ezekiel.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What have we got here?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Well, what we have, in other words, once more, is the nature of Christian experience.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   We saw last week that primarily and most essentially it means an awareness of God, a knowledge of God.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   There is no such thing as Christianity apart from that.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   We can repeat phrases, we can be learned, we can be packed with theoretical knowledge,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   but it's of no value at all unless we have a living experience of the living God.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Now, we looked at that and contrasted it with the false and the spurious that so often does duty for this.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And we are continuing that investigation this morning.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We are examining, I say, in the light of what we are told here, the nature of Christian experience.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   The way, if you like, to have true religion and to enjoy it in order that we may be useful in God's hands
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   in helping others in this modern world of ours with so much trouble and pain and sorrow and unhappiness and difficulty.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That is, I say, the theme that is here before us.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Ezekiel was sent to his people, this Ganesan people, and every one of us should regard ourselves as a missionary
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   in this pagan society in which we find ourselves in this country.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And it's true throughout the whole world.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Well, now then, what do we find here?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Well, again, of course, the great element is that of givenness.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   "Moreover, he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest."
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   God approaches him, God speaks to him, and that is always the vital thing in all true Christian experience.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Our consciousness, I say, and our awareness that God is dealing with us and doing something to us and giving us a call.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And then what matters is, of course, our response to that.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And that is what we are told about here, the response of the prophet to this further indication of God's call to him.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now, what did he do? What are we told?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Here's the vital thing.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   What is the nature, I say, of a true Christian experience?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   What's it like? What are its characteristics?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Well, first of all, we must put it negatively, because our very text this morning, in a sense, compels us to do that.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   We must discover, first of all, what true religion is not.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Or, if you prefer it in other language, what are the characteristics of a false kind of religion, of false Christianity?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Because there is much such. There is a great deal of that which masquerades as Christianity, which rarely has got nothing at all to do with Christianity itself.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Now, the very form of the lesson, I say, shows us that here is a man to whom a roll is handed, it's extended towards him, and he is commanded to eat it.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Now, there is the roll and there is the truth, you see, but you don't get a living experience until it's taken and it's eaten, in the way that I shall describe.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It's possible for a man, as it were, to hold this roll in his hand.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Now, that is the main characteristic of the false and the spurious in this whole realm of Christian experience.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   In other words, the most fatal thing of all is to have a religion that is entirely external, outside ourselves.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   That is the emphasis and the thrust of this word that we are looking at this morning.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Now, I want to put it to you in this way. I was reading, comparatively recently, a book rarely dealing with the subject of poetry and morality.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But I came across a very striking phrase, which I believe is undoubtedly true.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It put it like this. It was considering the case of a man like Matthew Arnold. "In a sense, religion overshadowed the Victorians instead of penetrating them."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Now, I think that's a very profound and most illuminating remark.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "In a sense, religion overshadowed the Victorians instead of penetrating them."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Now, there, I think, is a perfect statement of the matter that is conveyed to us in this section that we are looking at this morning.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I would add to that, I would say, that the great difference between the 19th century and the 18th century in the Church was just that very thing.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   As this man says so rightly, in the 19th century, religion tended simply to overshadow the life of the people.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   The glory of the previous century, the great century of the evangelical awakening, was that it penetrated, entered into them, and produced that profound revolution,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   not only in the lives of individuals, but also in the life of the whole country.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Now then, we must examine this. Is our religion simply something that overshadows us, or has it penetrated us?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Am I holding this roll in my hand, or have I eaten it, and as it entered into my bowels, have I thoroughly digested it?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   That's the possibility.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Now, let's examine for a moment a little further the characteristics of this false Christianity, this false religion,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   this thing which is merely overshadowing us like a cloud.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   What are its characteristics?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Well, obviously, the first is this, that it is something which is outside us, something apart from us, instead of being a part of us.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I've often thought of it like this.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Every man, as it were, has his book of life.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Everybody's got a book of life. It doesn't matter what your view, nor what your kind of behavior.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   There is a book of life which tells us how every one of us thinks and reacts, and how every one of us really is.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Well, now, there's your book of life.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Well, the whole trouble, I feel, about this false kind of Christianity is that the religious part only comes in in a kind of appendix at the end.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The book is finished. It isn't there.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   But then you find there's an appendix.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And in the appendix, you find the religion.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You see, it's something that's added on.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   It's not a part of the life itself, but it's something that's added on to the life.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Look at it, if you like, in another way.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   The characteristic is that it's something that a man takes up, and then he puts it down again.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Sunday comes, takes it up.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Or if you like, he puts on a cloak, but then he takes it off again, or he puts down the bag.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, there it is.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   It's outside. Ah, Sunday, back it comes again.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Now, that is obviously the first characteristic, and the most obvious characteristic of this false kind of religion.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   It really isn't in the man at all, but it's entirely outside him.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   It's apart from him, so that he can indulge in this action of taking and putting back.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Another characteristic, therefore, is that it's something which is spasmodic.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Oh, how terrible this false religion is.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Do you have to remind yourself of your religion?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Well, if you do, it's the false one, because it's outside you.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   If it were within you, you wouldn't have to remind yourself of it, as we shall see.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   It would remind you of itself.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   But there is that type of man.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   He suddenly has to remind himself of the fact that, after all, he is religious.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And then he does certain things.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And then he drops it, and forgets all about it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And most of his life, he's not aware of it at all.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   But then, again, he comes back to it.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Or, it may work the other way around.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   It's a betrayal of a man's whole position, when he's only reminded of his religion by circumstances,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and by things that happen to him.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   There's many a man, you know, who is vaguely religious, thinks of himself as religious,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   but it doesn't play any part in his life, really.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It's entirely outside him.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Then he's taken ill.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And the moment he's taken ill, he remembers it.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   But it takes an illness to remind him.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Or it may be an accident.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It may be a calamity.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   It may be a war.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   It may be the illness of somebody very dear to him.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It may be a death in the family.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It may be some business reverse.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It may be some disappointment in his profession.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Now, while everything was going well, this man very rarely thought about it at all.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   It was there somewhere, but not really in him.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And it's only when something unusual or untoward takes place that he's reminded of it again.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   It overshadowed the Victorians.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   It didn't penetrate them.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The role was outside.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   It wasn't inside.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And so, you see, the relationship of this person to the Christian faith
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   is something which is spasmodic and variable, haphazard, uncertain.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Another way of putting it is this.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Yes, the third way I can put it is that when this is true,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   religion is nothing but some vague, general influence only.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   That's why I like this phrase that I'm quoting.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   It's something that overshadows.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   It's like a cloud up in the sky.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Of course, it has an influence.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   It cuts off a certain amount of the sun.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   But it's only vague.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It's very general.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Oh, let's look at it like this.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   The characteristic of false religion is that it's nothing but a background to a man's life.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It's only the scenery, as it were.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   It's not the vital thing that's happening on the stage.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   It isn't an essential part.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's a sort of backdrop, a kind of back.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   It is there, yes, but in a sense, you know, you could do perfectly well without it.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   It has its little place.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It does come in.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   It gives a certain amount of atmosphere.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   But it's not really essential.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   It's not absolutely vital.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   A vague, general influence.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   There's nothing direct about it.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Nothing personal about it.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Nothing really specific about it.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   You know what I mean, don't you?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Religion, you see, can be but a vague, general, nebulous influence over a man's life.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And nothing more.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   It is that, but it's no more.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You see, these Victorians, that was exactly their position.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It was true of that man, Matthew Arnold.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   His father had been an ordained clergyman.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   He was a preacher.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And Arnold could never shake himself free from it.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   In many ways, he wanted to, but he couldn't.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It was there as a kind of overshadowing, something, an influence, but very vague and very general,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   very indefinite and indeterminate.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Is our religion something like that, or do we know of a direct and a specific and a personal influence of it all upon us?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   These are some of the questions we must ask, but let me go on to another one, which is this.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Obviously, it follows.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The trouble with a man who's got this false type of religion is that he doesn't really understand it.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   As I say, it is some influence that he's aware of.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It's something that's there over and above him, a background, but it's nothing to him but a kind of tradition.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   He was brought up to do this.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   He has a general feeling that there's something right about it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   He sees other people doing it, and therefore he goes on doing it.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   But if you went to him and said, "Now, why exactly do you do this?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   What exactly is this thing that you're doing?"
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   He wouldn't be able to tell you.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   He doesn't really know.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Let me put this in this form.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   The Apostle Peter, you remember, writing to ordinary Christian people like ourselves, said,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   "Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   He tells them to do it with fear.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   But the point I'm emphasizing is that he says that every Christian should be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in him.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Now, a man can't do that, you know, without knowing what he believes,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   without understanding why he is what he is and why he does what he is.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Now, the man who's got this false religion, all he can say is,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   "Well, I was brought up to do this, and I feel it's quite a good thing to do.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   There are certain good things about it and advantages."
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   But he can't give you an explanation.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   He can't tell you why this to him is more important than anything in life and in the world.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Another man says, "Well, you know, I wasn't brought up like that, and that's not my background.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I want to know really why I should consider this if I should consider this.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   What does it mean? What's it all about?"
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   No, no, he can't tell you. It's outside him, you see.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It hasn't penetrated.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   He hasn't understood it. He hasn't got a grasp of it.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   He can't explain it and expound it to another.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   But, according to this, a man must be able to do so.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   How can you help another unless you know yourself?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Can the blind lead the blind?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   If a man is just groping and is aware of some vague general influence
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   and being overshadowed by something,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   well, that doesn't enable him to help another and to explain it to the other.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Now, that is another characteristic, therefore, of this false type of religion.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And this leads to the final thing which I want to emphasize on the false side, which is this.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Such a religion, of course, is nothing but a kind of perpetual break upon life.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Religion overshadowed the Victorians, yes?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And, you know, many of them, indeed, the typical representatives of them, wished that it were not there.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   It was just like a cloud standing between them and the sun.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   They believed in progress. They believed in development.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Oh, how assured those Victorians were, how comfortable, how happy,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   how they thought everything was going to be perfect.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Empire was expanding, knowledge was increasing, why, nothing could stand in the way of progress.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Twentieth century, oh, it was going to be amazing.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   There it was. But still, you see, they were a little bit unhappy.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   They hadn't got the arrogance of the moderns.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And what kept them from an arrogance, a final arrogance, was this overshadowing of religion.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   You see, you can't shake it off suddenly.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   They wished they could, but they were afraid along certain points.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   There was all the tradition of the past, and they were a little bit hesitant.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   That's why it's so interesting to read their writings,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   and to see their hesitation and their hesitancy over certain aspects of the Christian faith.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Now, that's the effect of an overshadowing religion.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   It's simply a kind of break upon life, something that's always holding you up,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   something that you can't get away from.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Don't we all know something about this?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   A religion which is nothing but morality is nothing but a break.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   You wish you were like these other people who haven't been brought up in a religious manner,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   that you could go and do what they do on Sunday and every other day.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   You're a rebel against it. You feel it standing between you and certain things you want to do.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Now, that's religion overshadowing. That's the false religion.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   That's something outside you which isn't a part of it.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And all this I can sum up in these words.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   It is something that is purely negative.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It is something that is purely repressive.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   You see, it is something, as I'm trying to say,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   that is always standing between you and what you want to do.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   It's outside you, but it keeps on coming in front of you all along.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   This conscience that speaks, and you were going to do a thing.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Ah, no, you can't now. This thing has come in.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   This shadow, as it were, has come between you and the sun.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And, of course, such a religion is a joyless religion.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Its main effect is to make people miserable and unhappy.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   These are the people who've got enough religion and sufficient knowledge
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   just to make them unhappy and to spoil life for them.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   They're neither one thing nor the other. They've got nothing positive.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   But there's this perpetual restraint and hindrance and break.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   It's against them. It's always there, coming in at these different points, I say.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And the result is that they know nothing of the joy of the Lord or the joy of salvation.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   But they scorn delights and live laborious days.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   There, I think, in the men, are the characteristics of this false kind of religion.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   There it is in the roll, in the scroll, in the word of God that is handed to us.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   But it's there. It's always outside us.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   In a sense, you know, one is entitled to make this comparison.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   It is the essential difference between the religion of the Jews at the time of our Lord
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and what we read of in the pages of the New Testament.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   You see, they've got the law of Moses, external, written in tables of stone, outside them.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   The apostle Paul puts it like that.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   He says, "This thing which we've got," he says, "you are the epistles of Christ,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart."
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   You see, this other one, it's outside.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   It's ten commandments, morality, as it were, outside us, not inside us.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And there it is with its negations, its prohibitions, its threatenings.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And it leads to a joyless and an unhappy kind of existence.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Well, I wonder whether we've been examining ourselves as we ought.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   What is the character of your religion?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   What is the nature of your relationship to this truth of God?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Now then, let's come and look at the positive.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Here it is, "Son of man, eat that thou findest.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And he said unto me, "Son of man, cause thy belly to eat,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee."
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Then did I eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   You see the difference?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   What are the characteristics, then, of true religion?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Well, of course, they're just the exact opposite of everything that I've been saying.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   But let me bring out the positive yet more clearly.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   The first thing, obviously, is that it is something experimental.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   It's something that's got to be tasted.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It's something that has got to be proved.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Now that is the whole point of this illustration.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   That's why the symbolism was undoubtedly used.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   In order that this particular element should come in,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I say there is nothing more fatal than to forget the experimental aspect of religion.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   This was our main theme, of course, last Sunday morning,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   so I don't want to dwell on it extensively this morning.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   But I can assure you, my dear friend, that it'll avail you nothing that you know all the phrases
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   and have got your head packed with theology and learning and knowledge and doctrine
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   if you have no experience of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   There is nothing which is so dangerous to the soul
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   as a purely theoretical, intellectual, academic interest in these great and glorious doctrines.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   You can repeat them like parrots, you can become gramophone records,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   you can be as mechanical and as useless as a gramophone record,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   in a vital spiritual sense.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   That is not Christianity.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   The essential thing is that a man has tasted it.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   He has masticated it, he's proved it, it's a part of him, he's experienced it,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   something happens to him, there is a change in the man.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   This is surely the very central doctrine of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's not something outside me, but you know, knowledge can be something outside.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   As the apostle again puts it, "Knowledge, he says, puffeth up a charity edifier."
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   You can be puffed up with great knowledge and you can do great harm to the Christian cause.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   The test of a man is, after all, not his knowledge but his godliness.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Has he come into the presence of God? Has he been humbled?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Is he lowly? Is he meek? Or is he proud of his knowledge and his understanding?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Which is it?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   The test of true religion is, I say, that it has been experienced.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Be careful, my friends, how you talk about God and these great doctrines of grace,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   unless you exemplify them in your life and are a pattern and an illustration of them.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   This man, I say, proved it, and it's only a man who's proved it who can help others.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   He's a living witness. That is the Christian.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   He is a witness. He's one who testifies.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Yes, there is the external, the objective, the doctrinal aspect,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   but not only that, there is this other as well.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And the two must never be separated.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But let me come to the second emphasis which naturally follows.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   In other words, because it is experimental, it is something that is inside a man.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   It is within him.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   It's a part of him.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It is something that comes to a man and gives him life.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   You see, that is the characteristic of eating, isn't it?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   This man eats the roll. Imagine yourself eating bread, and there it is.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Well, that becomes a part of you. It builds you up.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It becomes an essential part of your very constitution.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And you can't separate yourself from it.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   You know, if you've got the real thing, you can't put it off and put it on.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   It isn't something you take up on Sunday and put away Sunday night.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It isn't something that you've got to be reminded of.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   No, no, it's always there.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Wherever you are, it's there. Why? It's a part of your constitution.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   It's a part of your being. It's in your bowels.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   It's right down in the depths, in the belly.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   These are terms that signify the very center of men's personality.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Oh, let me use the perfect statement of this.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   It's our Lord himself, of course,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   teaching this very selfsame lesson to the woman of Samaria.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And he used the illustration, didn't he, of that water and the well, you see.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   He was teaching spiritual truth to her.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   She could talk, of course, very cleverly about whether you should worship here or in Jerusalem.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   How you should worship, she could do that very cleverly and very glibly.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   We can be great authorities on these matters, you know,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and yet as dead spiritually as she was.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   So our Lord becomes personal, brings it home to her,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   convicts her of her sin, but he puts it like this also.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   He said, "Whosoever drinketh of this water pointing to the well shall thirst again.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   as a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   He says, you know, true religion is not something outside you
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   that you can argue and talk about and show your cleverness as this well is outside you
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   and you keep on having to go to it and taking.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   No, it will be inside you as a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   What a wonderful picture.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Well, the Apostle Paul can say the same thing, you see.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   What is to be a Christian? What is true Christian experience?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   It is this, "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   He's not somebody I talk about outside me.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   He is outside me, but he's inside me also.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   "Christ liveth in me, and the life I now live in the flesh.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and who gave himself for me."
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Is it in you, my friends? Is your religion in you?
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Is this a vital something that's a part of your life
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   that you can't detach yourself from it wherever you are?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   It is because it's in you.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   The role is no longer outside Ezekiel.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   He's taken it. It's gone into his mouth.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   It's entered into the vitals of his being and of his constitution.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I want to take that a point further.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   True religion is something which is always at the center of a man's life.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It's not only inside him. It's at the very center.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Now, these terms, of course, suggest all that, don't they?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   The bowels. "Son of man, cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this robe."
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   That was the terminology used in ancient times to describe the very center of a man's personality.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   The term "heart," of course, is also used.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Did you notice it later in verse 10? Listen to this.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   "Moreover, he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and hear with thine ears."
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Yes, but the great thing is, and that's why he puts it first,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   it's got to be received in the heart.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And the heart in Scripture generally means the very center of personality.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   It doesn't merely mean the emotions.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   It means the central citadel, that innermost point of a man's being and personality.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   In other words, the characteristic of a true religion is that it is always a heart religion
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   in the very center of the man's life.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Now, how does this show itself?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Here I'm going again to hold before you some of these foremost and chiefest characteristics
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   of a true Christian experience.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Obviously, because it is there in the center, it is something that controls us.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   It is the dominating factor in our lives.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   If you have to keep on reminding yourself that you're a Christian,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I suggest to you that you'd better examine the foundations again.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   If it's something that you have to take up and that you can decide when you take it up
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   and put it down, my dear friend, it isn't inside you.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   The man who is truly Christian is a man whose life is governed and controlled
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   and determined by this.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I live yet not I.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   He must be able to say that.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Unless you're aware, I say, that it's the dominating influence in your life,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   it can't be the real thing, because this thing is God, it's Christ.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And if it's there at all, it's there in this way that it is indeed controlling you
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   and determining everything.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Are you in charge of your religion or is it in charge of you?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Is it something that you take up or is it something that's constantly taking you up?
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   The Apostle Paul, in describing himself, puts it like this.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   He says, "I'm now trying to apprehend that by which or on which I have been apprehended."
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   What is a Christian?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Well, Paul's favorite expression in describing himself is,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   "Paul, the bond slave of Jesus Christ."
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Mastered by him, he's his slave.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   The bond slave.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   The thing is holding you, it's gripping you.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   This is the biggest thing in your life, and everything is determined by this.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It follows of necessity, doesn't it?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   The second thing is, and this is the most valuable test I always feel,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   that everything we do, therefore, comes from within.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Our lives, in other words, is nothing but an outworking of this great principle,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   this life that is now within us.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   You see, a Christian is not a man who adds things to his life.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   He's a man who is expressing that which is within him.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   I think I've possibly used this comparison, this illustration before.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   The difference between the false religion and the true religion is this.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   It's the difference between your decorated Christmas tree and your fruit tree.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   You can make very wonderful fruit, artificial fruit and flowers.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Man is so expert that he can almost give an exact replica of the true.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   But, you see, what you've got is this.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   You get your tree, and then you buy these things, your flowers, your fruit, your trinkets,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   and you put them on.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And at first sight, people think, "Ah, this is real."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   But it isn't. It's all artificial.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   You've been putting the things on to the tree.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   But that isn't the truth about a fruit tree, is it?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   What's a fruit tree?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Well, here's the great characteristic.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   The fruit comes from within, from the life of the tree.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   It isn't something you put on.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   It isn't something that becomes attached at a given point.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   It isn't the birds who hook it on.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   It isn't the insects that add it.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   No, no. It's the sap. It's the life. It's the power.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And it's expressing itself in a little bud which grows and develops.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   It's all from within outwards.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And that is the great characteristic of the truly Christian experience.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   You see, Ezekiel was only able to speak after he'd eaten this and it had gone into the bowels.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   And as it were, what he'd taken in has become life and sustenance and power,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and out it comes and he speaks.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   You don't speak effectively in any other way.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   You don't just hold a role and act as an advocate.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   You're a witness, I say. It's coming out of you.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And the whole of life comes out in the same way.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   A Christian is a man who doesn't have to force himself,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   therefore not quite know why he's doing this and not doing that.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   His activities are always something that arise from an inner compulsion.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Oh, let me give you some of the great statements of this in the New Testament.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   The apostles, you remember, were prohibited to speak or to teach any longer in the name of this Jesus.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   What was their reply? "We cannot but speak."
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   The apostle Paul says that they prohibited him, but he says,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   "Woe unto me if I preach not the gospel.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   The love of Christ constraineth me."
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   You don't have to take it up as a task and persuade yourself to do it.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   He says, "I can't help it. Woe is unto me if I don't.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   The love of Christ constraineth me.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   There's this power that's working in me."
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   And so he goes on putting it.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   He writes to the Colossians in exactly the same way,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   warning every man, he says, teaching every man.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   How does he do it? Well, according to this power that worketh in us.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Then his great doxology, you remember, at the end of Ephesians 3.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "Now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   That's it. It's all from the inside.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   But finally, let me put it like this.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   It is something that not only controls us, but it controls every part and portion of us.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   It controls the understanding.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And when a man is a true Christian, it governs the whole of his thought and of his outlook.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   He doesn't think the same as anybody else about anything.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   He's got a different view of politics.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   He's got a different view of these world conferences, the future of the world.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   He's got his own view. He gets it here. It governs his thinking.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   All his thinking, he hears about some wonderful discovery of science,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   which is supposed to have knocked the bottom out of Christianity.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   He instinctively doesn't believe it. He knows it will prove to be wrong.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   He's entirely unlike the other men.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   This controls his mind, his outlook, his whole orientation, the entirety of his thinking.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   But it also controls his will.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   A Christian is a man who is fully persuaded of the life and the rightness of the life he is living.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." Why?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   "It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   You see, Christianity is not against the grain to this man.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   He says with the Apostle John, "And his commandments are not grievous."
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   You know they're grievous to that first man? He wished they were not there.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   He'd be very glad if somebody really could prove that there isn't a God
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   and that Christ was never the Son of God and that there isn't a heaven and a hell.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   The commandments are grievous. He's afraid of them. It overshadows him.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And he does it because he's afraid, not this man.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   "Oh, how I love thy law," he says.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   "But his commandments are not grievous. His will is persuaded."
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   It's not against his will. He's not bombarded, dragooned.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   He wants to. It is his desire. He longs to be holy.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   He hungers and thirsts after righteousness.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   It's not against the grain. The will is controlled.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And in the same way, the heart is controlled. Thank God for this.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   "Then did I eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   He enjoyed it, you know.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Do you enjoy your religion, my friends?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Are you happy in your Christianity?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Do you know anything in this universe this morning that is comparable to this Christian faith?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Is there anything that you can enjoy as you enjoy the services in the house of God,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   your reading of the Scripture and your prayer and your fellowship with saints?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Is there anything equal to it? Is there anything so sweet?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   This is the test of the true thing.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   It always leads to joy and to rejoicing.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   "I would sooner be a doorkeeper in the house of my God," says David,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   "than to dwell in the tents of the ungodly." Of course.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   What does the world have to offer in any way comparable to this?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Read your hymns. Hymns of praise, joy, thanksgiving.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   What do they give the result of?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Well, the result of this man who has eaten the roll,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   and it's controlling his heart, his everything.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Are you enjoying your religion?
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Are you exulting in your Christianity?
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Is there praise in your heart? Do you rejoice before God?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Do you delight in praising Him?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   These are the tests.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   "It was as honey for sweetness in my mouth.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   I've never tested anything like it," he said.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Yes, and let me add this.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   You know, the Christian is a man who enjoys his Christian experience and life
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   in spite of certain aspects of the truth.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Do you know what he felt was as honey for sweetness?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Listen.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   "He spread it before me, and it was written within and without,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe."
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   The scroll that he was to digest and deliver,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   it had got threatenings, it had got most terrible statements in it,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   enough to depress a man, and for a moment he says,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   "I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   but at the same time the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   The Spirit lifted me up and took me away."
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   There were unpleasant aspects, but in spite of that,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   when he took it into his mouth and began to eat it,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   "It was as honey for sweetness in my mouth," says this man.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   And unless you and I can say that we rejoice even in tribulations,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   we haven't got the real thing.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   We rejoice, more of us, as Paul to the Romans,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   even in tribulations, Romans 5.3.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Not only so, but we rejoice also in tribulations.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   This is a joy, I say, irrespective of circumstance
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   and accident and chance and various happenings.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   The Christian, when he's got this thing,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   is so gripped by it in mind and will and heart
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   that he rejoices at all times.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   "Rejoice in the Lord always, yea, I say to you again, rejoice."
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Which is it we have, my friends?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Is your religion something that just overshadows you
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   or has it penetrated into you?
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Is it in your mind, is it in your will, is it in your heart?
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Is it at the center, is it like a fountain springing up
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   into everlasting life? Are you joying and rejoicing in it?
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Is this life to you?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   If you haven't got it, how can one get it?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Let me just give you the headings, it's all told us here.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   How are you to get this true Christian experience?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Well, you don't work it up.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   There's nothing more fatal than that.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   The spurious joy and happiness,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   it's carnal, it's worthless, it's artificial.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   You don't work it up. What do you do?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Well, there's only one thing to do.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   God is holding out the scroll to you, his own word.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   That was what was offered to Ezekiel,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   that is what gave him this experience.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   God held his word before him
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and you and I have got to take this word.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Nothing else will do it.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   This is the way, God's own prescribed way.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   What do we do with it?
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Well, the first thing is this, you've got to take it all.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   "But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Open thy mouth and eat that I give thee."
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   You and I don't decide what we take of this
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and what we reject, you take it all.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   If you want this happy experience, this joy of the Lord,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   this truly Christian experience,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   you've got to take God's word as a whole, as it is.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Lamentations, mourning and woe,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   as well as success and happiness and joy,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   take it all, take it as it is.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   If you begin to select and to choose and reject,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   you'll never know it.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   And these people who do that, they haven't got it, you know.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   They have to try and make themselves happy
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   by means of psychology.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Persuade themselves that they're happy
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   and they're not really.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   They'll tell you that, they say,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   "A true Christian, you know,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   should never suffer from insomnia.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   A true Christian should never have
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   a nervous breakdown," they say.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And then you read that the man who's preached
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   that very thing has gone down with insomnia
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   and a nervous breakdown himself.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   That's psychology, you see.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   It doesn't work.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   No, no, this is the word of God
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   and you take it in its entirety.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   You take Old Testament as well as New.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   You take the history as well as the teaching.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   You take the miracles as well as the didactic portions.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   You take the virgin birth.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   You take the atoning, sacrificial, substitutionary death.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   You take the literal, physical resurrection.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Take it all.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Take, eat that I give thee.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Don't be like these others who've picked and chosen.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Take it all just as it is.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   You must utterly submit yourself to it
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   in all its parts.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Second, take time.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   "So I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll."
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   "Son of man," he said, "caused thy belly to eat."
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   "Fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee."
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   "Thoroughly digest it" is another translation
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   of that last phrase.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Take time over it.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Chew it. Masticate it.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   The old adage puts it perfectly.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   If you want to have the rich experience of the saints,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   you've got to emulate their example.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   And you've got to take time with this Word of God.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   You don't just read your daily portion
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   and a few brief comments,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   and it's all over in five or ten minutes.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   That's not the way to build strength.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Make time for the Word of God.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Put everything else aside.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Give your time to it.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Masticate it. Chew it.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Make certain that it's thoroughly mixed
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   with the spiritual saliva of the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   And then I say meditate upon it.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Think over it.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Remind yourself of it.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Keep on doing that.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   That's chewing and masticating
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   and digesting thoroughly.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Working it out.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   And apply it to every part and portion of your being.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   And especially, I say again, your heart.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Son of man, all My words that I shall speak unto thee
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   receive in thine heart.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   See to it that you're moved by it.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   See that you're rebuked by it.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Not merely that you have a certain knowledge
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   that you'll be able to say,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   give an analysis very cleverly of the contents of a book.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Ah, that's not taking this scroll
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   and eating it and digesting it.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   That's superficial.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   That's of no value finally.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Get hold of it.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Let it get into your system.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Unless you feel rebuked by it and humbled by it,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   you haven't taken it properly.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Unless it lifts you on your feet again
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   and puts joy in your heart
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   and moves you and leads you to do something,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   I say you're not taking it properly.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Lopsided Christianity is a denial of Christianity.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   The whole man is involved.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   The food, the word of God is to go into the belly,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   into the bowels,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   right into the very center
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   so that the whole man is involved.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Well, there it is for us.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   And it's perfectly plain and clear.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   The lives of all the saints that have ever lived
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   are just illustrations
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   of what I've been trying to say very feebly.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   But my dear friend, having examined yourself,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   come to the inevitable conclusion.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Take the role.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   God is offering it to you this morning
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   through my feeble words.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   He's holding it out before you.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Take it.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Eat it.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Do what he tells you.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Take it all.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Chew it.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Masticate it.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Read.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Mark.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Learn.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Inwardly digest
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   so that you'll know that there is a well of water in you
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   springing up into everlasting life.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   And you will rejoice with a joy unspeakable
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   and full of glory.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Amen.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
