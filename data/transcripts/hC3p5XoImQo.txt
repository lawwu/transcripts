[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - Happy Wednesday and welcome to this sermon clip day
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.800]   on the podcast.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.640]   For a long time now, I've been drawn
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.760]   to a little two-part message Pastor John delivered
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.680]   in the spring of 2010.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.460]   And from this pair of messages,
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.400]   I wanna share some clips with you on the podcast today
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.060]   and in the weeks ahead.
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.720]   Historically, the sermons are interesting.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.840]   Pastor John was about to take an eight-month leave
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.640]   of absence away from the pulpit
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.880]   to work some things out in his own heart
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.040]   and in his own family.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.240]   Now, we've talked about this leave
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.040]   and the lessons he would eventually take from it,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   particularly in three episodes in APJ 138, 220, and 1227.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.840]   As you know from those episodes,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.000]   it was a defining season for him.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.240]   But first he had to prepare his church for this leave.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.760]   And that makes the tone of these sermons interesting too.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.560]   These two 2010 sermons are parting words to his church.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.600]   And because of that, they carry an urgency
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400]   that you're about to hear.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.200]   So how does a preacher say goodbye
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.880]   to his church for eight months?
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.600]   Well, we get the answer in these two messages.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.840]   These messages go deep inside the plan of God for his people.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.840]   They go down into the deepest foundation of our very joy.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.320]   And in that context, here's the first interesting clip
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.600]   I wanna feature on APJ.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.720]   It gets right at the heart
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840]   of what drives John Piper and his ministry.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.720]   How is he wired?
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.520]   Why does he do ministry the way he does it?
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.800]   Without further introduction,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.160]   here he is to explain on April 18th, 2010,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.640]   two weeks out from his ministry leave,
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.600]   speaking of his recent travels and what makes him tick.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.280]   Here he is.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.440]   - Almost always when I leave the church
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.200]   and go away to speak somewhere,
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.760]   I give messages that are the overflow
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.440]   of things I've done here.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.960]   I don't generally make new things up to say anywhere else.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.800]   I just try to apply to others what I've been thinking about
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.000]   and applying to you over the years.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.800]   However, at the end of February, I went to Seattle
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.760]   and on the way to Seattle was on the plane.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.800]   We had about four hour flight
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.360]   and prayed earnestly that God would give me a message
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.320]   for them.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   And there was in my mind churning this issue
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.600]   of how to say in a fresh way,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.840]   something I've said over and over again
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.360]   for who knows how many years.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.440]   And I delivered that message three times.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.600]   I was crafting it in my head and then trying it out
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.160]   on all those people for you.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.360]   I wanted to get it right
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.600]   so that when I tried to bring clarity here,
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.920]   I wouldn't be stumbling around
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.760]   like I did in a couple of those messages, I think.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.920]   So here's the thing that needs clarification evidently.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.600]   And this goes out of some conversations I've had
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.680]   and those of you who conversed with me
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.520]   will know who I'm talking about.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.440]   I appreciate them.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.280]   The question is that I've asked audiences
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.160]   for 10 years maybe is this,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   do you feel more loved by God when he makes much of you
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.320]   or when he at great cost to his son
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.720]   frees you to enjoy making much of him forever?
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.800]   I've just asked that everywhere I've gone
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.760]   all over the country for 10 years or so.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   Do you feel more loved by God because he makes much of you
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.520]   or that at great cost to his son,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.680]   he frees you and empowers you
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.960]   to enjoy making much of him forever?
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.800]   I like that question a lot.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.720]   I still do.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   And I'll try to explain why.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.760]   The aim of that question was never
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.200]   and is not now to deny that God makes much of us.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.680]   He does.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.180]   And we'll get to that shortly.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.040]   The aim has been to help people
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.520]   relocate the bottom,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.080]   the deepest foundation of their joy
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.320]   from self to God.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.880]   So let me try to explain and help you understand
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   something that makes me tick
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.240]   and why I speak the way I do about things like this.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.760]   Why do you go around the country saying such things,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.160]   shake people up like that
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.520]   and cause some of them to misunderstand?
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.440]   And here's the bottom line.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.600]   And even this I fear is gonna be misunderstood.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.280]   So I'm gonna jump on a clarification of it
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   as soon as I say it.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.000]   I am more concerned, this has been true for 30 years.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.240]   I am more concerned about nominal,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.920]   hell-bound Christians
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.360]   who feel loved by God
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.880]   than I am about genuine heaven-bound Christians
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.600]   who don't feel loved by God.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.640]   Let me say it again.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.920]   I don't know why,
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.960]   but as I just do what I feel like doing
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   in the Word and in preaching,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.080]   I feel more concern
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.120]   for nominal, hell-bound,
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.280]   church-going Christians who feel loved by God
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.080]   than I do about genuine, authentic,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.240]   born-again, heaven-bound Christians
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.120]   who don't feel loved by God.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.800]   Okay, now lest any of you poor souls
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.160]   who don't feel loved by God,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.680]   and there are many of you,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.080]   think that means he doesn't care about us.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.280]   He just said so.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.120]   I didn't.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.400]   I care really deeply about that issue.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.240]   But if I have to rank who I wanna jostle and bring,
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.880]   I wanna rescue people.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.920]   Who are totally deceived
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.240]   about whether God loves them or not, savingly.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.080]   But I really, really care about my family, you,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.160]   and whether you live in a halfway Christian life,
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   knowing he loves you and never feeling it.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.120]   And really saved, really saved,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.000]   because there's that seed deep down,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.280]   you'd die for him in a minute.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.280]   And you wish, you just wish you could marvel at it more.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.320]   So don't hear me saying,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.640]   I don't care about that,
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.280]   or I don't wanna invest in it.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.280]   This sermon is that investment.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.120]   And I hope I can do more
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.500]   without letting the other one go.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.380]   So what I'm doing in explaining what makes me tick
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.580]   is try to give a perspective
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.460]   on why I emphasize what I emphasize.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.980]   There are millions of nominal Christians
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.980]   who are not born again,
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.620]   and who believe God loves them,
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.260]   and are on their way to hell.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.940]   And the difference between them and a born again believer
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.160]   is what's at the bottom of what makes them happy.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.040]   As you penetrate down, down, down, down, down, down,
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.100]   to what makes them happy,
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.960]   and you get to the bottom,
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.320]   it's different for a born again person,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.140]   and an unborn again person.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.680]   Millions of nominal Christians
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.640]   have never experienced a fundamental change
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.680]   in the foundation of their happiness.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.020]   They haven't experienced it.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.860]   They go to church for other reasons.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.620]   Instead, they've absorbed the notion
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.940]   that becoming a Christian means
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.820]   turning to Jesus
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.620]   to get what you always wanted
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.980]   before you were born again.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.580]   No change in what you want.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.840]   No change in the bottom,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.700]   the foundation of what thrills you.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.340]   Just get it from a new place.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.420]   The baggage in the hotel room in the same,
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.380]   got a different bellhop.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.220]   The meal stays the same, got a different butler.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.180]   And they think they're Christian,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.820]   and they feel really loved
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.140]   because he's producing.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.140]   My life is going better.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.660]   They want a happy marriage,
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.720]   so they turn to him to get it.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.840]   They want peace of conscience,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.300]   so they turn to him to get it.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.860]   They want freedom from guilt feelings,
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.720]   so they turn to him to get it.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.860]   They want escape from hell,
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.300]   so they turn to him to get it.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.800]   And every unregenerate person on the planet
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.900]   wants those things.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.580]   You don't have to be born again to want out of hell.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.500]   You don't have to be born again to want a good marriage.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.660]   You don't have to be born again to want any of those things.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.740]   So what's new?
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.140]   Got a different bellhop, different butler,
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.020]   a different servant to give me what I want.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.100]   I'm concerned about those people.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.900]   There's some here.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.180]   I would suspect in this room not as many as the other kind.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.480]   I think God will hold me more accountable
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.460]   for trying to help those people wake up
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   than for helping his precious children feel more of him.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.700]   Though this sermon is about that,
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.840]   and I'm just setting the stage
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.660]   for why I talk the way I talk.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.100]   I haven't even started yet.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.700]   [audience laughing]
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.460]   In other words, they would say,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.380]   these people I'm so concerned about,
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:35.180]   we have desires and we turn to Jesus to get them met.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:41.900]   And he is so loving to meet them.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.500]   No change at the bottom, no change in your cravings.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.320]   In what makes you most deeply happy.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.460]   No change in the decisive foundation.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.980]   Just shop at a new store.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.080]   That's not the new birth.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.660]   It's not having, the new birth is not having
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.540]   all the same desires that you had as an unregenerate person
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.300]   and then getting them from a new source.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.620]   That's not the new birth.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.000]   The new birth changes the bottom,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.220]   changes the root, changes the foundation
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.180]   of what makes us happy.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.180]   Self at the bottom is replaced by Jesus.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.900]   Treasuring being made much of,
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:39.020]   at the bottom is replaced by treasuring Jesus.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.500]   Everything changes.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.820]   We don't perfectly express these changes.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.000]   That's why I can be so confident
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.560]   that so many non-delighters are saved.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.560]   What makes the born again person glad
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.200]   is not at the bottom that they have God's gifts,
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.580]   but that they have God.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.000]   That's the key way to see it.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   You listen for it in the way they talk,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.720]   the way they pray, in the way they speak
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.360]   to each other and to God about,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.140]   are they most excited about his gifts
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.620]   or are they most excited about him?
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.300]   Do they long for the people they love to see him,
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   admire him, glorify him, live in him, hallow his name,
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.460]   or do they only ask for and seek food and clothing
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.820]   and job and the things the world wants?
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.620]   It's not wrong to pray for those things.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.360]   It's just what the world prays for.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.760]   It's not wrong to want those things.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.080]   It's just what the world wants.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.800]   There's no evidence in being born again
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.560]   that you want what the world wants and get it from God.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.800]   Christians who are truly on their way to heaven
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   and don't feel loved by God
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.200]   are in a different category than that.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.640]   - Powerful, and to introduce one other topic,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.120]   a related one here,
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.820]   this is also precisely why the prosperity gospel fails
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.500]   because it requires no new affections.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.140]   It simply feeds those old spiritually dead affections
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.340]   for wealth and health and prosperity.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.700]   So when you hear Pastor John condemn the prosperity gospel,
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.140]   this is one of those key themes as to why he does so.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.460]   This was from John Piper's April 18, 2010 sermon
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.460]   on Psalm 79 titled, "How Much Does God Love This Church?"
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.240]   The whole thing is online.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.380]   I found this clip, but if you find one,
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.260]   email it to me, give me your name, hometown,
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.740]   the sermon title and timestamp
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.220]   of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.460]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.340]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.980]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.420]   It's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.420]   Well, what are church traditions?
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.140]   Do we need them?
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.500]   The Apostle Paul says, "Yes, we do."
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.420]   And we'll look at why next time.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.520]   I'm your host, Torrey Ranke,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.960]   and we are joined in studio again
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.720]   with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.620]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:28.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
