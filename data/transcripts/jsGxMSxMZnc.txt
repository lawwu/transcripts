[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.880]   - Welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.240]   I'm here with Judah Smith.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.560]   I call him the GOAT.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.300]   What's good with you, bro?
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.140]   - So good.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.260]   I'm so excited to be doing this.
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.600]   We've been talking about it for a while.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.680]   Your haircut looks absolutely sensational right now.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.040]   - Stop, bro.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.480]   Man, my first question for you is,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.760]   so like I tell you this all the time,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.600]   you're one of the most humble and good human beings
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.440]   that I know.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.260]   - Thank you for saying that.
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.520]   - But you're kind of a big deal.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.800]   Like you're a pastor in this big church.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.960]   You know, you have a huge following,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.440]   but it didn't always start out like that.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.840]   Like it didn't, you know,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.960]   I want to know if you always envisioned it
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.760]   being as big as it is now,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.900]   or did it just kind of come naturally?
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.900]   - Yeah, I think of course the right answer is no, I didn't,
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.120]   but it's actually true.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.920]   Like I think I always had a sense
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.120]   that I wanted to make a big difference in people's lives,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.740]   and I just enjoyed making people feel happy,
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.560]   feel like they could do what God put in them to do,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.720]   and the dreams that are in them.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.800]   And so one of our models in our family
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.240]   is we want to make people feel like they can fly.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   And there's a lot of ways to do that.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.760]   Thank you, that's nice.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.080]   And I have to credit Michael Jordan, come fly with me.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.900]   Like, Judah, that's not related, you know?
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.560]   But I watched that a hundred million times.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.000]   But yeah, man, I just wanted to serve people
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.800]   and to be honest, I wanted to be a youth pastor
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.520]   for my whole life, that was the goal.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.720]   And then stuff happened with my dad and his health,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.320]   and so I kind of got tricked into the lead pastor thing.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.080]   But hanging out with young guys like you
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.000]   is still probably the funnest part of what I get to do.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.120]   - My God, do you enjoy it?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.100]   Like, is this what you wanted to be doing?
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.040]   And like, do you enjoy it?
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.120]   Or does it get sometimes like,
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.080]   you just wish you could live a different life?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.120]   Or is this like everything?
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.120]   - Yeah, I think probably like all of us, right?
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.240]   You have those moments where you're like,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.720]   "Man, I kind of wish I did something else."
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.120]   But then you kind of wake up and go,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.720]   "Actually, this is the best life ever."
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.160]   I will say that some of the collateral
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.060]   that comes with being a public pastor
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.480]   is when your kids get a little bit hurt, you know?
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.000]   They're like, "Yo, Dad, so-and-so not like us anymore."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.580]   Or, "I think there's some people that don't like you."
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.780]   And you're like, "Ah," and trying to explain
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.560]   some of the criticism and the critique.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   And I don't blame people for criticizing and critiquing.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.240]   People care deeply about scripture.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.080]   They care deeply about integrity and character and morality.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.800]   And these are things that I care about deeply as well.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.860]   I think sometimes people think,
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.700]   "Well, if you dress a certain way
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.360]   "or if you have certain friends,
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.320]   "you can't actually hold some sort of standard
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.640]   "of God's word," you know?
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.440]   But actually, you can, and we're endeavoring to do that.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.780]   So I love this life.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.160]   It comes with its challenges, but I chose it, man.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.520]   - I actually was about to ask you this later
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.360]   about your kids.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.320]   You brought up how they can ask you questions
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.920]   about what's going on with certain people.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.600]   Why do they not like me anymore?
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.840]   Do you ever worry about your kids being pastor's kids
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   and the challenges that kind of come along with that?
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.240]   - Yeah, I do, man.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.480]   And I think you know what it's like.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.440]   Your parents were public figures as well.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.680]   And you know what it's like when your parents
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.980]   are example Christians, like Christian examples.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.860]   There comes a pressure.
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.320]   You and all your brothers and sisters are like,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.180]   "Well, we gotta be good, I guess, too."
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.900]   And so you know what that's like, and it is challenging.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.340]   I think one of the reasons our kids
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.580]   are in the L.A. public school system
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.220]   is so that they would receive exposure.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.660]   I believe in education a lot.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.580]   I just might believe in exposure more.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.740]   It might be the greatest form of education.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.260]   And I wanted them to be cultured.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.660]   I wanted them to be challenged.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.340]   I wanted them to really experience life.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.020]   And I think as a result, the church bubble
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.580]   that's somewhat a part of my life,
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.180]   it isn't everything for the Smith family.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.060]   - They're very like, yeah, I've been around them.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.500]   They're like cool kids.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.580]   (laughs)
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.060]   I remember me-- - Thank you for saying that.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.540]   - Yeah, for me growing up, I was homeschooled
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.520]   all the way 'til eighth grade.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.340]   And I remember going into school in eighth grade
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.020]   and literally, I didn't know what was going on.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.220]   These kids were talking about stuff
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.580]   I had never heard about.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.660]   They were doing stuff I didn't even know
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.500]   was a thing for kids my age.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.880]   And so that point that you bring up about exposure,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.440]   I know every parent parents differently,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.380]   but I could definitely see that being big,
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.740]   especially for pastor's kids,
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.460]   so they're not just little weirdos.
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.020]   (laughs)
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.800]   - Well, whatever your parents did,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.540]   I will go on record on Curious Mike right now
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.260]   and just say they have raised some of the most considerate,
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.060]   kind, socially skilled kids I've ever seen.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.900]   And I mean that.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.080]   I just love you, your siblings.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.740]   Your parents are heroic to me.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.860]   And it's not easy to raise kids these days, man.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.700]   - Thank you, brother.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.120]   - But you're an incredible example, for sure.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.960]   - Thank you, brother.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.420]   So what about you and your own struggles,
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.980]   your own temptations, as you grew into the limelight,
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.100]   becoming the pastor that you are,
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.220]   the big time pastor that you are,
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.980]   what do you struggle with?
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.300]   Or do you have those?
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.860]   To me, you seem like a superhero.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.860]   You don't deal with much temptation.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.580]   But I know everyone's human, so what do you deal with?
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.160]   - Yeah, I think the brokenness in all of us
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   just has to be addressed, has to be identified, mitigated.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.460]   I think there are things that I just won't do
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.920]   because I don't fully trust myself.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.500]   I love who I am, I enjoy that,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.660]   but I don't fully trust myself.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.220]   And I think kind of any person who's like,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.460]   "I totally trust myself."
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.740]   I'm like, "Well, I don't know if I trust that."
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.620]   You know, 'cause you really gotta be honest with yourself.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.620]   So I don't travel alone, I don't meet with women one-on-one,
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.500]   I don't call women one-on-one, text with,
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   I just, for me, a commitment, I'm a one-woman kind of guy.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.660]   And I've just made that commitment.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.020]   To say that there's no temptation there is silly,
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.100]   of course, but I made a commitment with my heart,
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.900]   my emotions, my eyes, my thoughts.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.040]   And if you just take it a day at a time,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.780]   it's a lot less overwhelming sometimes
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.220]   because we're so inundated.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.540]   And obviously, I pray for you almost every day.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.300]   And when I do, I constantly think of the unique challenges
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.700]   and temptations that come with being
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.820]   a handsome professional athlete, I might add.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.220]   People do not know this about Curious Mike,
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.500]   but he was rated the best-looking Denver Nugget on the team.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.300]   That's a fact, that's a fact.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.780]   And I had to inform him, that's how humble this man is.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.980]   He didn't even know that you won the fan vote,
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.680]   but I was proud. - You're crazy, man.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.340]   - But there is unique temptations, isn't there,
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.620]   that come with leadership and people that know you.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.220]   And so it's like before the emotion of a beautiful woman,
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.820]   before you get into a wrong situation,
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.700]   it's like owning your proclivities
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.480]   and tendencies and weaknesses.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.660]   And the way you do that, by the way,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.300]   is you say it out loud to close friends
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.820]   who know you and walk with you.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.700]   Like, "Hey, this is what scares me."
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.260]   I'll never forget, I told my future father-in-law
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.420]   at the time, this is 22 years ago,
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.300]   he asked me before I got the permission
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.660]   to marry his daughter, he said, "What's your greatest fear?"
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.500]   And I was like, "Oh, man, shoot.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.980]   "I don't know if I'm gonna tell him the truth."
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.660]   He goes, "Mine is suicide that I will commit."
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.160]   He goes, "My older brother committed suicide
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.000]   "and that's mine."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.380]   And so when he did that, I was like,
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.860]   "I think that's honest, I better match that."
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.440]   And I said, "My greatest fear is that I would cheat
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.520]   "on your daughter if I had the honor to marry her."
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.360]   And he goes, "What?"
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.060]   And I go, "My middle name is Elwood."
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.260]   - You're a bold man.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.660]   - Yeah, but I just had to tell him
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.540]   because I was like, at some point,
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.540]   either I'm gonna be honest with this man
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.340]   and I'm gonna set this thing in motion in an honest way,
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.180]   or I'm gonna give him number two greatest fear
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.020]   or number three.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.420]   And I was like, "Nah, I'm just gonna go for it."
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.660]   And then he ended up telling me something
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.540]   that changed my life.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.380]   And he felt like my awareness that I could do that
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.780]   would be the reason I wouldn't.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.800]   - Yes, that's big time.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.940]   I know a lot of Christians or people,
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.940]   they think they'll grow into this spot
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.260]   where they're almost invincible
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.760]   and they can do anything, be around anything,
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.780]   and it won't affect them.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.780]   But you are saying the way you battle it
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.060]   is every day realizing your weaknesses
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.420]   and realizing they're not going anywhere.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.940]   Even as you grow in faith
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.180]   and every single day we strive to be better,
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.060]   those temptations, they're not going anywhere.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.300]   So you, to this day, don't travel alone,
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.200]   don't hang with girls one-on-one.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.500]   - I don't trust myself.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.780]   For me, it's a fact.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.260]   - And that's you being a pastor.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.700]   And I think that's just so big time
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.820]   because I know, I talk to people a lot
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.020]   and they say, as you grow
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.540]   and you can start doing certain things
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.580]   that you might not be able to used to do.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.880]   And that might be true in some sense,
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.840]   but overall, our temptations are,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.820]   they're not going anywhere
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.820]   no matter how close with God you get.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.340]   So I think that's dope.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.620]   - Thanks, man.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.080]   - Man, I got an interesting topic for you.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.340]   I wanna talk about that Instagram page,
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.620]   Preachers With Sneakers.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.420]   It talks about, you're on there,
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.620]   I know another pastor on there,
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.840]   some other big time pastors,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.100]   but they always are posting your guys' clothes
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.340]   or your shoes and they're putting the price tag
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.660]   and I don't know what they're trying to do,
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.820]   condemn it or whatever they do.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.720]   I wanna get your perspective on that.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.020]   See, to me, it's like, if you like clothes,
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.860]   wear cool clothes.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.500]   If you like shoes, wear cool shoes.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.600]   But this page and then a lot of the comments
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.320]   are condemning towards pastors that wear nice things
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.060]   or have nice things.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.780]   What is your take on that?
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.460]   - Well, it's wild that you bring that up
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.300]   because I actually just did a podcast
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.060]   with the creator of Preachers With Sneakers.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.580]   - Did you?
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.980]   - He's actually become a friend,
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.100]   only because I felt like, all right,
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.660]   somebody's having a go here
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.660]   at my friends and more kind of the role in culture
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.060]   that pastors hold and they're having a go at it.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.160]   So I was like, okay, I wonder,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.460]   I was taught when somebody really comes in
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.260]   hot and heavy with criticism,
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.300]   to stop at least for a moment and go,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.660]   is there any truth to this?
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.020]   Oh, and by the way, if I react to this
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.440]   and I don't like it, is that 'cause it's kinda true?
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.020]   So I just started to ask the question,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.700]   well, what would be some truth here in this approach?
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.380]   I don't prefer putting people on blast.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.820]   You don't know how people got those Gucci shoes
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.820]   or got that, not that it necessarily matters,
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.880]   but assuming that preachers everywhere
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.380]   are spending the amounts of money
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.780]   that he's posting on that particular piece
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.780]   is obviously a gross assumption, right?
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.300]   'Cause who knows if their so-and-so grandmother
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.260]   is one of the part owners of Gucci
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.900]   and this person-- - Who knows?
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.740]   - For free, right?
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.660]   You just don't even know.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.420]   And by the way, if you have a few dollars,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.580]   I'm not even saying a lot,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.360]   and you choose to spend money on eating out all the time
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.260]   or somebody else chooses it on a shirt they like,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.400]   well, hey, that's tough to start making calls on that,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.500]   which is wrong and which is right.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.060]   I think money is neither good nor bad.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.900]   It's what you do with it, right?
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.460]   So, but I do think the truth that I really took to heart
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.460]   was, hey, is my clothes a stumbling block
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.500]   to people hearing what's way more important?
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.340]   And that's about the love of Jesus and the love of God.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.380]   And so, I actually kind of put my arms around the whole thing
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.300]   and said, I hear you.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.740]   Like, I hear you, and you know what?
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.360]   I think we need to sober up a little bit
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.460]   as preachers and pastors.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.300]   And I think this might have gotten a little out of control.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.740]   And so, I have made some adjustments
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.320]   to be completely candid, preachers and sneakers.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.140]   The approach is not necessarily what I prefer,
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.620]   preachers and sneakers, and the young man who started it
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.180]   has become someone that I would consider friendly, you know?
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.180]   But yeah, I would never do that to my friends.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.960]   I would never put my friends on blast
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.820]   and post what they spend on their clothes.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.500]   That's not my approach, but I do think that as a preacher
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.240]   who stands on a stage and enjoys clothes,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.540]   fashion is always, I was raised by a strong mother
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.000]   and older sister, and they're like,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.940]   you're coming to the malls of America,
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.780]   and we're gonna teach you our ways.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.100]   So, it's a passion of mine,
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.300]   but I found other ways to express that passion,
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.980]   and Amazon Essentials is my new favorite brand.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.900]   I wear a lot of Amazon Essentials, so.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.460]   - That's pretty amazing.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.900]   Like, if I were you, I would have heard that
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.960]   and been like, man, what?
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.940]   Like, if I wanna spend my money on shoes, I'm gonna do it.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.640]   But you kind of took it, and your conclusion was like,
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.260]   I'm gonna try to at least change it a little bit.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.340]   I'm kind of surprised by that, actually.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.260]   - Well, I just, I really mean it, you know?
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.380]   And I saw your interview with Lecrae, for sure,
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.100]   and I just love that man so much and respect him so much.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.920]   I think, I listen to Lecrae, and I feel a similar pain
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.760]   that I share with him.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.580]   Not in any means am I saying that I'm this incredible,
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.300]   well-known artist like Lecrae is.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.600]   He's incredible, but I think there's that pain of like,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.500]   man, I think people don't realize, like,
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.460]   I chose this 'cause I love people a lot.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.000]   Like, I know Lecrae loved music and hip-hop,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.780]   but he loved people, and so I love standing on a stage,
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.340]   telling people about Jesus, and then their eyes lighting up.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.380]   Or even like, you and Ciara have been in services,
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.940]   and I can see you laughing, you know,
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.780]   when I'm telling a joke.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.200]   Like, it means the world to me.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   So, if somebody comes to me, even abruptly and as abrasive,
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.340]   and says, your clothes are a distraction to helping people.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.220]   Man, I gotta at least step back and go,
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.680]   is there any truth to that?
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.100]   'Cause if there is, how easy for me to change my shirt?
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.220]   Like, how easy is that?
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.820]   That's nothing, man.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.100]   Now, start, you know, quoting and judging people
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.340]   on the amount of money they make and all of that.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.140]   That's a real, real slippery slope.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.700]   You know, when, what's the amount of money
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.140]   you don't judge people and criticize people?
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.380]   Well, that's silly, right?
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.420]   So, I think it is a slippery slope
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.900]   when we start taking shots at each other
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.140]   for the amount of money we have.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.980]   - What about him?
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.140]   Did he, how did he react to it?
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.900]   Did he kind of see how his actions were hurting people
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.620]   and like, you guys were seeing that?
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.100]   And did he kind of come to any--
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.340]   - Yeah, I'll give him a lot of credit.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.900]   I'll say this, in the recording we did,
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.580]   which I think is promoting a resource
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.820]   or a book that he's putting out.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.780]   He was cool, man.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.860]   He said, you know, I really regret
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.020]   some stuff I did early on.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.100]   And between me and you, I was like, what did you do?
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.340]   I don't even know, man.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.140]   I just like, I'm not on social media that much.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.220]   So, I'm like, wait, what did you do?
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.620]   And actually, he told me a few things
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.620]   and I was like, oh, yeah, bro, that's not good.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.180]   Like, some of those are my friends, man.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.300]   Like, that's my family.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.380]   Like, and he's like, yeah, dude, I'm sorry.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.020]   And I was like, oh, bro, thanks for saying that.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.620]   So, you know, he didn't have to do that
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.780]   and he didn't have to say that.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.160]   And so, man, I'm down with anybody who's like,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.740]   you screw up, you just own it.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.860]   And you go, man, it's what I did.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.320]   I'm, you know, I shouldn't have done that.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.580]   And it's like, cool, no problem.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.060]   Let's keep rolling.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.100]   - That's good.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.820]   'Cause he's a Christian dude.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.220]   I think I saw an article about it.
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.220]   So, obviously, he wasn't trying to come off the way he was.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.580]   He probably didn't even know you guys
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.820]   even paid attention to that stuff.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.940]   But that's one thing, like, even me,
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.580]   people don't understand, like, as celebrities
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.580]   or whatever you wanna call it, like, we see stuff.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.900]   When people are talking whatever, like, we see stuff.
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.740]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.360]   And I think, like, one thing he was doing,
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.180]   like you just said, was judging.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.500]   And I think as Christians in general,
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.060]   one of the biggest turn-offs that Christians
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.700]   can put out in the world is how judgmental we can be
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.420]   and how, like, we think that we're better than people
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.700]   or we think that because we're a Christian,
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.420]   like, other people shouldn't do stuff.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.580]   Or we just, we put judgment out in the world.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.460]   And I think, like, that is one of the worst things
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.980]   we can do as Christians if you wanna bring
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.180]   more people into the family.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.340]   You know what I mean? - Yep, yep.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.180]   - Do you agree?
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.020]   - I totally agree.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.080]   And I'm reminded of that story where Jesus goes to,
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.060]   I wanna say Nicodemus, and for some reason,
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.300]   I am really messing up the name.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.820]   And that's hilarious.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.780]   This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.860]   I do read my Bible most days, so.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.260]   But there's this scene, it's not Nicodemus.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.220]   It's Zacchaeus, thank you, Zacchaeus.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.060]   ♪ Zacchaeus was a wee little man ♪
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.860]   ♪ A wee little man was he ♪
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.940]   So not Nicodemus, that's a great story as well.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.020]   But he goes to Zacchaeus' house,
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.340]   and Zacchaeus was a godless man
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.660]   who stole money from the Jewish people.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.700]   And he was hated by the Jewish people.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.540]   And here's Jesus, the Jewish Messiah.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.900]   And he goes to his home, and here's my point
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.840]   about judgment and putting people in categories
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.780]   and assuming upon people based on a curse word,
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.640]   based on a cigarette, based on a rated R movie
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.500]   that they don't know God for these arbitrary,
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.940]   natural, fleshly things, is really unheard of
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.180]   in the lifestyle and trajectory and ministry of Jesus.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.220]   For instance, Zacchaeus, he goes to Zacchaeus' house,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.980]   and we're actually not even told the details, Mike.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.720]   We're not told the details, except that we know
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.420]   at the end, basically, of the scene that we're told,
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.820]   that we're privy to, Jesus goes,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.100]   "Salvation has come to this house today."
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.740]   And the only thing we have on record,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.560]   Nicodemus shifting or changing, is he said,
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.020]   "I'm gonna give back double all that I've stolen,"
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.620]   which is an outrageous claim.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.000]   And my point is, Nicodemus saw something in Jesus
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.960]   at that dinner that so transformed him.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.980]   But what he didn't see, Mike, was tradition,
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.580]   customs, rules, the Ten Commandments.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.620]   That's not what changed Zacchaeus,
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.980]   who was basically a thief, he was a crook.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.800]   He was a very, he would, you know,
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.420]   he'd be one of the big Ponzi scheme guys today
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.060]   that would go to jail for a long time.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.780]   Jesus went to dinner with him, he loved him.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.820]   By the way, to go to dinner with somebody in those days
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.660]   was one of the most intimate things you could do.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.620]   It's like posting on Instagram, "This is my guy."
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.580]   It was like a cosign.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.780]   Jesus didn't care, he went to his house, he loved him,
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.420]   and Zacchaeus experienced transformation,
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.420]   not by the change of his outward decorum or demeanor,
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.340]   but by a transformation of his heart
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.780]   that only Jesus can do.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.660]   So I take incredible issue.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.740]   I think Christianity has colluded with the culture
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.980]   to the point that we now have categories
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.400]   that Jesus never gave.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.700]   We have, "That guy's hot for Jesus.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.980]   "That guy's lukewarm.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.820]   "That guy's not."
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.100]   Like, we come up with, that's not in the Bible.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.780]   That's not, those categories were not given by Jesus.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.300]   And I get very concerned when it comes from Christians
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.540]   when we start going, "Well, you know,
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.940]   "they're not a believer."
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.460]   And the irony is I've been in settings now,
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.700]   and I know you have too,
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.120]   where people make judgment calls on public figures.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.900]   They just don't know they're our friends.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.140]   You ever been in one of those settings?
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.620]   Well, I know so-and-so, they're not a believer.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.280]   And you're like, "Actually, they are,
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.300]   "and that's my friend."
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.380]   Like, so I've had preachers call out in their sermons
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.140]   my friends and belittle them,
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.920]   and I've had to call them on the phone and say,
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.280]   "Can I ask you a question?
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.680]   "Have you ever met them?"
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.520]   - Right.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.180]   - And the answer is always, "What, no."
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.900]   I go, "Well, actually, I have, and that's my friend."
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.120]   And so I think it's outrageous for you
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.840]   to make a judgment call to your congregation.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.640]   But Mike, that's where we're at in some cases.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.020]   We're calling public figures out,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.740]   and we're treating them like cartoon characters
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.380]   and not real humans.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.560]   - There's no doubt.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.260]   And the story you just brought up about Zacharias.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.940]   - Nicodemus, I know, I got us all mixed up now.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.780]   - Zacchaeus.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.620]   - Oh, Zacchaeus.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.600]   Yeah, Nicodemus was the first guy.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.320]   We are so confused.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.440]   - But not, like, Jesus hung with the sinners.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.280]   - That's right.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.240]   - And he, you know, he would go to dinner with them.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.180]   He would be with them.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.080]   And then because he was so unconditionally loving
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.100]   towards them, like, that's what changed their hearts
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.940]   a lot of the times.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.440]   I think, I think, like, people get it misconstrued today,
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.120]   and they think that you have to, like,
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.240]   earn Jesus's love or whatever.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.040]   And, like, a verse comes to mind about,
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.240]   you know, this is something I'm kind of confused about,
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.080]   so I want to ask you.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.900]   - Please.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.120]   - It says, like, if you don't do the right things,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.840]   then it shows that you're not in God,
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.520]   or it shows that, like, God is not in you
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.120]   if you're not doing the right things.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.000]   But Jesus, when he was on earth,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.840]   he was hanging with people
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.640]   that weren't doing the right things.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.000]   So, like, where do those two type of things
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.240]   kind of, like, come together?
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.520]   - To be honest, the distinction that is imperative
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.640]   to draw delineation between,
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.380]   you are referencing kind of,
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.760]   you're quoting what would be, like,
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.480]   a conglomeration of verses, which is like,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.880]   hey, isn't there verses in the Bible
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.520]   that are, like, fruits of repentance, for instance?
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.180]   Like, you will show that you have changed your mind
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.640]   about God and the world, and Jesus is king,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.960]   and you'll demonstrate that you believe that,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.080]   and you've had a change of mind,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.600]   because your actions decorum and demeanor will change,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.440]   right, that's what you're saying,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.960]   and the scripture does teach that.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.940]   But then you're saying, well, how does that,
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.240]   how can we marry that to the trajectory of Jesus' ministry
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.560]   as he hangs out with people who,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.280]   in some cases, never changed, right?
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.600]   - You put it way better than me, but yes.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.640]   - But no, but this is a really important question,
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.680]   theologically, right?
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.120]   So the distinction would be arbitrary timetables
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.960]   that we impose, and here's our problem.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.080]   We think in, what somebody said,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.880]   evangelicals and Christians think in weekends,
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   Catholics think in centuries,
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.320]   and we actually kinda need to meet somewhere in the middle,
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.160]   meaning we have arbitrary timetables.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.540]   So let's say that I'm your friend.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.720]   Let's say you love Jesus and I don't, okay?
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.120]   Now, a lot of people in Christendom would say,
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.900]   yo, Mike, your buddy Judah, that's your best friend,
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.600]   and now I'm making us best friends, this is very convenient,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.800]   but they would say to you, that's your best friend,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.200]   your best friend didn't know Jesus,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.440]   your best friend's doing this, this, this, this, and this.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.120]   Mike, you need to tell your best friend,
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.400]   and maybe your response would be,
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.240]   which I hope it would be, it's like,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.040]   I think my friend understands who I am,
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.640]   what, how I live, what I'm about,
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.760]   and I'm just gonna love him,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.280]   and I know when the time is right,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.260]   God is going to persuade him.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.000]   By the way, my favorite definition of faith
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.360]   is divine persuasion.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   So the Bible makes it very clear, you can't save me,
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.960]   you can't convince me, but you can love me,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.720]   and you can serve me, and over a process of time,
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.640]   but here's the reality.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.820]   What those well-meaning Christian friends mean is,
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.160]   your best friend needs to get saved fast,
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.320]   or something's wrong with you,
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.720]   and I think those arbitrary timetables
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.240]   are causing us to try to force people to become Christian,
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.880]   we're trying to force people to understand Jesus,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.560]   and that is not at all how it works,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.920]   and here's what I would say.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.300]   If I was trying to peddle a man-made religion,
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.040]   I would have to coerce, force, manipulate, right,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.440]   all of this, but either, is God God, or is he not?
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.960]   If he is, then let God be God,
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.020]   and that's what I say about,
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.360]   I have so many friends still that don't know Jesus,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.840]   and people, that bothers people,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.120]   it bothers people that I'm a pastor and a preacher,
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.960]   and I have very close friends
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.040]   that still don't believe what I believe, right?
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.960]   I see, we've seen thousands of people saved in our church
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.680]   this past year, even during COVID,
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.640]   and yet I've still got friends who haven't,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.380]   but, but what an honor to, I'm playing the long game,
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.520]   so like, I got friends right now who are 38, 32, 37,
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.360]   don't know Jesus, and I'm like,
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.800]   they may not know Jesus 'til they're 82,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.880]   but guess what I'm gonna do?
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.440]   I'm not going anywhere, I'm gonna love 'em,
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.880]   we're gonna share meals together,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.320]   and they're just gonna keep watching me,
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.720]   love my wife, love my kids, love Jesus,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.240]   and then I just keep telling God,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.880]   that's your, that's your son, that's your daughter,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.360]   so you're gonna have to show yourself to them.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.240]   I'll answer questions, I'll be there,
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.520]   but I'm not gonna convince 'em,
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.880]   'cause I didn't convince myself,
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.160]   so I can't convince them, so that's up to you.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.040]   - It's all God, and that's what I--
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.880]   - That's it.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.280]   - I had to come to that conclusion,
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.160]   like I would try so hard to, just myself even,
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.800]   will myself to be better, and like you said,
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.440]   outwardly do certain things, and it got to the point
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.520]   where like, I had to literally like,
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.040]   step all the way back and realize,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.960]   the people that were just on the outside
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   doing all the righteous things,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.200]   and trying to follow the rules,
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.040]   those are the same people that killed Jesus
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.360]   and were yelling crucify him,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.800]   and then I came to the realization
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.240]   like he was hanging with sinners,
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.480]   but a lot of times, they came all the way back around,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.080]   and I just, like why?
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.840]   And I got to the same point you got to,
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.880]   God changes us, like we don't do that.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.360]   We can't just will ourselves,
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.920]   we might have a couple good days,
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.880]   a few good days a week of doing good,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.240]   but then we're gonna mess up again,
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.440]   and then if you're living in that space of,
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.960]   you know, I have to do this, this, this,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.040]   you're always gonna be guilty,
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.440]   and then what's the point of being a Christian,
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.320]   you know what I mean?
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.240]   But when God changes, and you're continuously
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.360]   like looking at him to like change your heart
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.800]   and mold your heart, it takes so much of the pressure off,
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.480]   and that's the real joy of being a Christian,
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.960]   and I had to get to that point,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.240]   so I totally understand what you're saying.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.040]   With our friends, like we can't will them
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.320]   to become Christians, but we can love 'em unconditionally,
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.520]   at least as good as we can, so.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.640]   - You know what's crazy, Mike?
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.360]   I was reading in John 13, it's verses 34 and 35,
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.400]   yesterday or the day before,
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.840]   and it says, Jesus says, I give you a new commandment,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.320]   and I was like, ooh, cool, new, right?
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.400]   It's a new, this is novel, this is exciting,
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.600]   who doesn't like new stuff?
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400]   A new commandment, and it says,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.560]   love one another, love one another.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.480]   Now, first of all, I'm like,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.120]   loving one another is not new, Jesus,
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.320]   why do you call it a new commandment,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   and here's what I discovered, here's the new part.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.040]   Comma, love one another the way I have loved you,
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.920]   and here's such a gross misunderstanding about Christianity.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.080]   The essence of the Christian journey is impossible,
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.680]   but we won't admit that.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.560]   We think in our own effort, in our own strength.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.880]   Do you know what Jesus requires to follow him?
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.520]   Total and complete surrender, which is to say,
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.960]   here's how you surrender verbally.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.040]   I can't, God, I can't do this.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.640]   I'm empty, I'm broken, I'm weak, and I can barely,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.520]   I'm struggling to accept myself, to love myself,
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.800]   let alone love my neighbor.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.620]   That's why the Bible says, love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.680]   We can't even love ourselves without the help of Jesus.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.880]   Bro, I've had so many sleepless nights where I've wondered,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.320]   am I ever going to fix this temptation, these challenges,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   these weaknesses, these proclivities?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.800]   Am I a hypocrite?
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.240]   Am I really a man of God?
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.400]   Can I really pull this off?
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.360]   Can I be a dad?
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.120]   Can I hold a real marriage together?
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.320]   Like, am I gonna do this?
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.360]   And every day it brings me to this point,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.840]   which is so powerful.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.080]   God, I can't do this.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.340]   That's why Jesus said, I want you to love each other.
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.820]   This is how you'll know you're Christians.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.600]   You'll love each other the way I love you.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.040]   I took issue with God the other day,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.140]   'cause I said, Jesus, that is impossible for me
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.900]   to love people like you love me.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.560]   But that's the point, right?
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.280]   That we come to Jesus and go,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.720]   this life of following you and loving people is impossible.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.240]   And Jesus is gonna say, that's right.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.040]   But I'm gonna do in you what is impossible,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.800]   and I will teach you to love people.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.580]   And dude, if that isn't compelling,
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.540]   we are living a supernatural, abnormal life
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.760]   because of Jesus.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   It's awesome, man.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.360]   - Man, that is powerful, bro.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   - It's the best life.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.200]   - That is.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.280]   Amen, that is.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.960]   (laughing)
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.800]   That is powerful.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.400]   I had some other questions that were less deep, but--
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.360]   - Bring it on, let's do it, whatever you want.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.200]   - That's so good, man.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.360]   My next question is for the young fellas.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.160]   Like, I've seen you and your wife interact,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.360]   and you guys are so, so dope together
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.680]   in the way you just support each other and everything.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.340]   What would you tell to the young dudes
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.980]   and what to look for in a girl and eventually a wife?
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.020]   Like, what's the main things you want to look for?
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.940]   And talk to me, too, 'cause I'm looking, too.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.260]   - Yeah, we're gonna turn Curious Mike into Seeking Mike.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.260]   Here we go.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.860]   Like, who says that?
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.340]   Who says that?
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.780]   Seeking Mike.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.780]   We're gonna turn Curious Mike into Searching Mike.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.720]   Well, I think, first of all, quite literally,
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.980]   the first approach has to be, hey, would I marry me?
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.360]   As silly as that sounds,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.480]   I think that's where this whole conversation starts.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.260]   Hey, if I'm honest, would I marry me?
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:15.260]   Like, am I a good, like, for instance, right?
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.480]   Let's talk to Curious Mike for a second.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.240]   Okay, you want a woman who listens,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   who is empathetic, caring, strong, knows who she is.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.380]   Keeps herself looking beautiful, right?
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.700]   The best version of herself.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.860]   I mean, you always look sharp, put together,
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.060]   you like fashion, style, like all these things you want,
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.040]   right?
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.320]   Here's what's funny, is you project that with your own life.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.380]   So a lot of people fail to recognize
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.380]   that there is some magnetism involved that's just natural.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.340]   And that is, if that's what you want,
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.460]   if you project empathy, being a good listener,
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.180]   being selfless, when you see your friends,
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.860]   how you doing, man, are you good?
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.060]   Bro, tell me what's going on in your life.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.500]   I want to know right now.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.660]   Well, guess what?
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.400]   You're going to be, what's going to attract to you
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.860]   is women who are like, who like to roll that way.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.060]   And they're going to be attracted to you
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.300]   and you're going to be attracted to them.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.460]   So I think the misappropriation
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.820]   that is probably really underrated
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.060]   is that you got single adults rolling around going,
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.940]   man, I can't, fine, I'm so, I'm so,
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.940]   man, I went on this date, I was so angry at this girl,
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.500]   she was so annoying, and I'm like,
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.780]   well, I bet as you got angry,
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.540]   it certainly didn't put her at ease
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.580]   and make her be her best at dinner.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.420]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.340]   So if she feels your tension, now she feels guarded,
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.020]   I bet it was a bad date.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.220]   As opposed to, I'm going to give this date a chance.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.780]   I'm going to open up a little bit.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.580]   I'm going to ask questions about her.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.100]   I'm going to, and I would just urge men and women everywhere
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.140]   who are in pursuit of a life partner,
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.180]   like, man, allow yourself to begin to develop,
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.020]   you know, a lot of people are like,
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.020]   well, how do I become a better listener?
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.260]   Start practicing at least once a day,
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.380]   having a conversation where you talk
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.980]   way less than the other person, literally.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.300]   So Chelsea and I have a little contest when we travel,
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.980]   and then I'm kind of outing myself now,
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.220]   'cause pastors love to talk.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.260]   Is this podcast not proof of that, right?
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.500]   Preachers like to talk.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.740]   But we would go to dinner with the host preacher
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.900]   or the conference we were at,
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.540]   and we would always make sure that in the dinner
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.540]   we would get that, the other couple,
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.280]   to talk more about themselves.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.980]   In fact, twice as much as we would,
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.700]   'cause we felt like that would ensure
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   that that couple would feel encouraged
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.260]   and heard and valued and loved.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.580]   And so that's been a game.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.420]   It's more than a game.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.920]   It's a lifestyle now for me.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.220]   But playing the game taught me a way of living.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.500]   And I practice unselfish concern.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.060]   Unselfish concern is I'm concerned about you
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.060]   because I love you, and that's it.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.940]   Selfish concern is, yo, Mike, how you doing?
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.420]   Yo, you got any Puma gear?
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.440]   You know, like, whatever, you know.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.740]   But unselfish concern is, gosh, I just love you for you.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.740]   You know, you're enough.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.540]   - And that's, in and of itself,
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.780]   is a supernatural type of thing.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.460]   You don't just, you can't just do that.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.300]   - You can't just do that.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.140]   - That's from God.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.220]   - That's you're like, God, you gotta help me.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.020]   - 'Cause you can't just become--
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.460]   - We're naturally selfish, right?
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.700]   - For sure. - Born selfish.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.540]   - Well, talk to me,
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.860]   because you're friends with a lot of celebrities.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.820]   You know, you've helped Justin along the way a lot.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.420]   What about a dude like me where I'm in the NBA,
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.420]   there's plenty of, you know, girls around.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.460]   - Killin' it in the NBA.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.300]   - How do you, in a situation like that,
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.980]   filter through and find a girl
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.220]   when they all could just be, you know.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.900]   'Cause, like, I know a lot of my,
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.940]   even my teammates or whoever watches this,
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.820]   a lot of us don't even know girls' intentions.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.300]   We can't decipher, 'cause they could put up a front.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.380]   They could be their best selves for a date,
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.420]   but they could be their best selves
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.540]   all the way 'til you get married,
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.860]   but you don't really know what you're marrying
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.700]   until you marry 'em.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.140]   How do you decipher that?
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.840]   Like, how do you help Justin?
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.140]   How do you help guys like me?
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.540]   - I definitely think, it's so funny.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.980]   People hear the word prayer,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.100]   and they're, like, intimidated.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:58.940]   Walls go up.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.760]   Oh, but here we go again.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.140]   So cliche, but what I actually mean is
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.900]   that you would take your concerns to God
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.620]   and say 'em out loud and listen to yourself.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.580]   Say them out loud.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.060]   God, I'm afraid that I am going to get involved
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.260]   with a woman who only wants me
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.180]   because of what I do or money I have.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.160]   That's a start, number one, is express to God.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.180]   My favorite thing to do to ask a dating couple
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.580]   or a soon-to-be-married couple is,
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.800]   okay, greatest fears about the relationship go,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.060]   you gotta be honest, and to hear someone,
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.680]   which is so cool about you.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.580]   I think you're a very transparent person.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.740]   That's a commitment you've made.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.740]   You've wanted to be honest and real,
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.860]   which, since the moment we met,
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.300]   you've been an open book, which I love that about you.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.140]   I think it's an incredibly endearing quality.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.820]   It's a Jesus-like quality.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.420]   So that's obviously what you desire,
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.240]   but I'll say this.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.340]   You gotta be honest with God,
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.340]   and then, I wish more guys did this,
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.900]   and I say guys only 'cause I am a guy
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:58.900]   and we're picking on guys,
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.500]   but I could suggest things to women,
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.180]   but I've never been a woman, and neither have you,
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.700]   and so sometimes I feel a little bit out of depth,
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.260]   so I'll say this to guys.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.900]   I am still at a loss why men
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.220]   don't communicate expectations early on
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.820]   in any potential relationship.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.880]   I want you to know, like, if I were you,
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.320]   I would be like, I'm gonna put out there
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.480]   my expectations and intentions in a woman,
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   and not to make her require any person to,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.440]   but simply to say, hey, if you and I are gonna work,
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.160]   like, here's the kind of person I wanna be.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.400]   Here's what I value, and here's what I'm about,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.800]   and then I'll say, secondly, if I were you,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.760]   when I would go on these dates,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.620]   I would put something very vulnerable on the table,
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.320]   and I would see if that vulnerability was met,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.580]   because if that vulnerability is met,
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.980]   at least you perceive to the best of your ability
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.820]   that vulnerability is met,
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.780]   you might have just stumbled on a very special person,
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.400]   because typically, when somebody shares vulnerability,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.420]   the most you'll get from someone
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.580]   who's not comfortable with that is like,
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.220]   wow, that's really vulnerable,
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:15.220]   and maybe a giggle, we barely know each other,
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.920]   and it's like, okay, this person has some walls up,
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.240]   which, by the way, is very natural.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.260]   I'm not saying that's a wrong thing.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.660]   I just know you enough to know
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.100]   the kind of woman you're after,
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.820]   and I know you want a woman who's very honest and open,
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.380]   so that you guys can connect at a deep level.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.220]   - Thanks, bro.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.740]   - I mean, that's like my, that's my best Dr. Phil,
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.060]   you know, so. (laughs)
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.060]   - That's a good Dr. Phil.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.000]   My last question for you, and then we'll wrap it up.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.080]   If you had the whole world in an audience,
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.140]   and you had to preach a sermon to the entire world,
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.380]   and everyone's tuned in, like, listening just to you,
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.780]   what would you preach about?
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:57.860]   - Well, I think any preacher out there
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.660]   who hasn't thought this through to an extent
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.960]   probably just hasn't been preaching very long.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.500]   Like, as a basketball player,
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.420]   do you ever think about what your last shot will be?
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.340]   Like, you know, I just watched Michael's last Chicago shot.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.620]   You know, he crosses over,
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.500]   the guy from Utah, I used to know his name,
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.020]   hits that shot, and Bob Costas or somebody says,
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.180]   and maybe that's the last shot we see,
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.980]   the great Michael Jordan, you know.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.380]   What's your last shot?
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.040]   And so, for me, it's a last sermon.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.260]   What's my last sermon?
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:35.260]   And I think it's, there's only one,
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:40.220]   and it's, I'll say this.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.780]   In Acts 17, Paul goes to this,
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.940]   he goes to Thessalonica, then he goes to Berea,
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.820]   and then in Acts 17, he's kind of in a,
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.160]   he's in a holding pattern in Athens,
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.260]   and Athens isn't quite Corinth of the day,
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.620]   but Athens has a little bit of LA, Tokyo,
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.060]   Hong Kong, New York vibes, right?
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.260]   It's a pretty cultured city,
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.180]   a lot of tourism at the time in Athens
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.860]   when Paul would have been there in Acts 17,
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.260]   and it says he was compelled by all of the idol worship
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.300]   that he saw, and he went to some open square
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.860]   and he saw all these idols and their names,
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.620]   and there was just one idol, and it was unnamed,
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.940]   and it said to the unknown God,
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.900]   and I mean, I could almost get emotional about it.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.860]   Paul gets an audience because he was a genius
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.400]   and a brilliant, and he says,
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.420]   "I want to tell you about that unknown God,"
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:36.420]   and I think the reason, the ultimate reason I preach
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.860]   is 'cause I still think the country I was born in
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.860]   and raised in still doesn't know Jesus,
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.220]   and there's an unknown God, and he's the true God,
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.420]   and what I mean is we know some of the customs,
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.760]   we know some of the traditions,
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.420]   we know some of the practices,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.300]   we're familiar with the pageantry,
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.420]   we're familiar with singing songs,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.040]   we're familiar with preachers preaching
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.080]   in certain tones and things, we're used to bands now,
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:16.080]   we're used to productions, lobby time,
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.120]   we're used to getting coffees at churches now,
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.560]   there's all these things we're used to,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.920]   but I'm like, but do we know him?
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.880]   Who is he?
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   I looked at John 13, and I'm like,
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.480]   love one another as I have loved you,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.680]   and so the operative question is what?
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.700]   Do you know how he loves you?
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.860]   Do you know how God loves you?
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.400]   Because if you knew how God loves you,
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.260]   you would be quite literally mesmerized.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.780]   I mean, who's not after love?
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.320]   What big recording artist has ever hit it big
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.220]   without singing about love?
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.700]   Oh, that would be no one.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.340]   Not a single recording artist in history
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.620]   has ever made it big, whatever that means,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.900]   without singing about love, why?
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.300]   Because at the core of our being,
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.900]   we all want to be loved.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.540]   Like, we just want to be loved.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.980]   Do I matter?
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.500]   Am I seen?
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.220]   I was here, do people know that?
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.340]   Do I have a purpose?
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.380]   Am I loved?
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.180]   And the message, Mike, you and I are trying
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:21.180]   to get out to the world is yes, and yes, and yes,
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.860]   and what we're saying is we can prove it, too,
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.540]   because there was one man, only one,
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.820]   who predicted his life, his death,
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.420]   his burial, and his resurrection,
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.220]   and we'll throw in the ascension,
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.020]   and he pulled it off.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.540]   There's only one, and he has a name,
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.140]   and we're told where he was born,
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.420]   and the city he was raised in,
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.740]   Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.740]   who physically walked this earth 2,000 years ago,
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.620]   and he's changed the world as we know it.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.220]   I am in love with him.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.020]   He has revealed the creator of heaven and earth to us,
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.980]   and I am overwhelmed and undone
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.460]   at his endless, unconditional love,
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.380]   yes, for me, yes, for my wife, yes, for my kids,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.380]   but for my friends, for new friends,
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.980]   and ultimately for the world.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.900]   I believe we're at a crossroads,
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.500]   in a crossroad of cultures in this country
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.980]   and around the world,
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.500]   and I believe that there has never been
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.260]   a more important time for entertainers,
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.660]   artists, preachers, writers, thinkers,
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.540]   singers, dancers, to tell the story of God,
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.860]   and it's a story that is so unknown,
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.620]   and we just gotta make it known
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.660]   that people are loved and they're cared for,
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.820]   and so I know that's what you're about.
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.620]   It is your fault for having me on here
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.540]   and asking that question,
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.580]   because this has turned into
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.700]   what I think is a 16-minute sermon,
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   which is only a very short sermon,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.940]   but thank you for asking that question,
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.500]   and it means the world,
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.380]   and thank you for having me on Curious Mike.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.580]   - Like you said, bro, that's what it's about, man,
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.100]   so I haven't done this on any of the other ones,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.620]   but you're so inspiring to me.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.900]   I just wanna ask, do you think that we could just pray
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.540]   for whoever watches this sermon?
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.980]   - I would love that.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.940]   - And end it that way?
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.180]   - We having a full-blown altar call, right?
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.460]   (laughing)
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.940]   Let's do it, let's do it.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.860]   God, I thank you so much for, first of all, this man.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.620]   I thank you for Mike.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.300]   Thank you for the opportunity to do this podcast,
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.260]   and more than anything, together, Mike and I just pray
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:28.660]   for each and every person watching this right now,
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.860]   and we ask that you would persuade.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.780]   Persuade us of your love.
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.460]   Persuade us of your reality.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.940]   Persuade us of your validity and your power
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.260]   and your protection and your providence
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.020]   and your peace and your joy.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:50.020]   Jesus, help us to show the world who you are and what you do.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.860]   I thank you so much for the opportunity to talk
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.100]   and be here with Mike, and we pray all this in Jesus' name.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.940]   Amen.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.780]   - Amen, thank you.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.620]   - Amen, thank you, man.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.460]   Love you.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.980]   - Shout out to Lemon Perfect.
