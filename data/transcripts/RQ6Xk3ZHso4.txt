[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.560]   Tesla's gonna win level five.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.720]   They really are.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.920]   - So let's talk about it.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.000]   You think, you're focused on level two.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.160]   Currently, currently.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.320]   - We're gonna be one to two years behind Tesla
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.280]   getting to level five.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.560]   - Okay.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.480]   - Hey, we're Android, right?
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.320]   We're Android.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.140]   - You're Android.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.400]   - I'm just saying once Tesla gets it,
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.880]   we're one to two years behind.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.880]   I'm not making any timeline on when Tesla's gonna get it.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.160]   - That's right, you did, that's brilliant.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.920]   So what do you think about this,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.040]   the most level four companies
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.160]   are kind of just doing their usual
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000]   safety driver, doing full autonomy kind of testing,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.920]   and then Tesla does basically trying to
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.800]   go from lane keeping to full autonomy.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.040]   What do you think about that approach?
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.640]   How successful would it be?
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.920]   - It's a ton better approach
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.200]   because Tesla is gathering data on a scale
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.440]   that none of them are.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.760]   They're putting real users behind the wheel of the cars.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.440]   It's, I think, the only strategy that works,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.680]   the incremental.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.200]   - Well, so there's a few components to Tesla approach
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.040]   that's more than just the incremental.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.640]   What you spoke with is the ones, the software,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.960]   so over the air software updates.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.040]   - Necessity.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.680]   I mean, Waymo crews have those too.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.840]   Those aren't.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.040]   Those differentiate them from the automakers.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160]   - Right, no lane keeping systems have,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.000]   no cars with lane keeping system have that except Tesla.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.960]   - Yeah.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   - And the other one is the data, the other direction,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.080]   which is the ability to query the data.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.720]   I don't think they're actually collecting
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.720]   as much data as people think,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.360]   but the ability to turn on collection and turn it off.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.040]   (air whooshing)
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.720]   (air whooshing)
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.400]   (air whooshing)
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.080]   (air whooshing)
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.760]   (air whooshing)
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.440]   (air whooshing)
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:10.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
