[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Hello, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode we're going to talk about
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.960]   the negatives of early retirement life that nobody enjoys talking about.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.600]   Now it's been over six years now since I left my day job in 2012 and I must say that for
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.040]   the most part it's been pretty good, but I've also discovered plenty of negatives since
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.480]   the time I left.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.720]   I know why we revert back to our baseline state of happiness no matter how much freedom
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.940]   and how much money you have.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.320]   So let's go through five of the negatives of retiring early now that I'm a grizzled
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.560]   veteran.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.380]   So the first negative is you will suffer an identity crisis for an unknown period of time.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.620]   When you've spent at least a decade working in a profession, you'll find it incredibly
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.760]   jolting to no longer be identified as the person who is a marketing expert, an investment
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.360]   professional or the management consultant who can figure out how to optimize a business.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.920]   It's only after you leave where you truly realize how wound up you were in your profession.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.080]   It's always the case where you never really fully appreciate what you have until it's
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   gone.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.400]   Your identity crisis may last as short as let's say two or three months or it may last
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.520]   for years.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.840]   It all depends on how wrapped up you were in your job, how much you cared about that
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.080]   job, how long you spent getting educated after high school to get that job and whether you
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.560]   have a clear plan post-retirement.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.840]   So for example, doctors who spend what, years and years, four years at least after college
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.240]   and then three years of residency to become full-fledged doctors are the people who suffer
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.480]   the most after leaving their occupations with regards to having an identity crisis.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.280]   Conversely, high school graduates who somehow strike it rich with a product or an invention
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.160]   or who simply just make a good amount of living and save and save and just decide, "You
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   know what, I'm not going to do this anymore," seem to adjust much easier in post-retirement
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.720]   life based on the people I've talked to over the years.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.960]   Job titles can be incredibly addictive.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.360]   Why else do people get so depressed when they're passed over from promotion?
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.560]   Why else do people try so hard to get promoted sooner and faster than everybody else?
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.480]   Do not underestimate the importance of being a manager, a director, a vice president or
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   even a C-level executive.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.280]   It really does mean a lot to your identity.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.440]   After all, the most common question most people ask when they first meet each other is, "What
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   do you do for a living?"
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.000]   And if you tell them you don't do anything for a living, well, then you might just feel
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.280]   like a sheepish loser.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.520]   And you'll want to try to explain yourself, but by then, your three-second first impression
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.560]   will no longer hold the person's attention and they'll probably just move on.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.720]   So in my case, after working in the Asian equities business for 13 years, it felt hollow
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.600]   to no longer have my executive director title or be identified with my investment firm.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.320]   After all, I was there for 11 years.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.660]   I felt sad that I could no longer go to Asia for conferences or with clients.
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.720]   For so long, I would take a business class trip to Hong Kong or India or China or Taiwan
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.200]   that it was part of my quarterly routine.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.280]   I felt special every time I was allowed to board first.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.880]   You know, business class, board three, four, economy class.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.360]   Because generally, I'm just flying economy like I am now.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.820]   And I felt important when clients would entrust me to show them around in a foreign land.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.880]   So for the first year after leaving my job, I wondered how the business was going to do
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.200]   without me.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.920]   Could they really survive without my relationships and expertise?
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.280]   After all, my partner and I built the business to the foundation it is when I left.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.520]   So surely they needed my relationships and my skills.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   But after months went by with no email or no phone call from my old employer saying,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   "Hey, we want you back," I had to come to terms that I was no longer important to them.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.200]   I wanted to believe that my position meant something to the firm and to the people that
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   I serviced.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.760]   But at the end of the day, the person I trained to replace me as part of my severance agreement
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.120]   was good enough.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.680]   And because he was good enough, I concluded that I was no longer any good.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.920]   So this ego hit took me a full year to get over where I was finally like, "You know what?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.840]   I'm going to leave this world behind because I've got a new world with me with Financial
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   Samurai."
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.960]   Two, you will be stuck in your head.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.680]   There is this disease called locked-in syndrome.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.260]   It's where the patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.360]   paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.120]   and blinking.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.920]   So that is kind of like my worst nightmare.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.560]   And when you retire early, you're stuck in your head because when you suddenly have an
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.080]   extra 10 to 14 hours a day of free time, it's very difficult to optimize your time wisely.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.080]   Just like how bedrooms and kitchens and living rooms naturally get messier and messier and
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.000]   messier, your mind naturally gets lazier and lazier the more time you have to do anything.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.680]   So your productivity will suffer.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.960]   You will no longer feel motivated to achieve great wins.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.760]   And as a result, you might slowly start to get depressed.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.940]   Only after some really deep soul searching and some "What the hell am I doing with my
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.940]   life?"
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.100]   questioning will you begin to organize your time better and become more productive.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.720]   Your mind really can be dangerous because it can always second-guess your actions.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   You're going to ask yourself, "Did I retire too soon?
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.640]   What if I run out of money?
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.080]   What if people think I'm a loser?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.640]   What if I can't get back into the workforce if things go wrong?"
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.720]   When you have a lot of time to think, your doubts go on and on.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.480]   Therefore, retiring early may render you inoperable for an unknown period of time.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.700]   So what happened to me?
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.840]   Because I left work at the age of 34, I was worried for the first two years whether or
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.400]   not I had made the right choice.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.640]   Originally, my plan was to work until age 40.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.360]   But then I was like, "Well, I found Financial Samurai and I negotiated my severance, so why
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.360]   not?"
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.040]   But still, I had my doubts.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.880]   No rational person leaves a well-paying job to be unemployed in their mid-30s.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.200]   Because once you're in your late 30s, that's when the money really starts getting good.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.180]   And by the time you reach your 40s, you should be at your maximum earnings power.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.600]   During my first year of early retirement, to the outside world, I proudly proclaimed
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.000]   I was retired from a career in finance.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.600]   But on the inside, I was second-guessing my decision to leave.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.560]   Because of my uncertainty, I decided to do some part-time consulting with some financial
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.360]   technology startups for about 20 hours a week.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.800]   It was a great way to distract my mind from all my fears, earn some side income, and re-plug
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.060]   myself into society.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.220]   I also dived deep into my writing on Financial Samurai, writing three posts a week.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.620]   Writing has always been my most cathartic way to deal with any uncertainty or problems
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.000]   I might have.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I wasn't afraid to tackle any topics that concerned me.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.280]   For example, recently I talked about earning $300,000 a year in order to live a middle-class
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.880]   lifestyle in San Francisco.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.160]   And the reason why I did that was I wanted to look at the numbers to see how much you
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.880]   would need to live a comfortable lifestyle in San Francisco if you had to pay for private
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.560]   school tuition.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.640]   Now the reason why is because there's a lottery system in San Francisco where there's no guarantee
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.360]   that my son could get into a public school in my neighborhood.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.840]   And if that's the case, then I guess I have to pay for private school or I've got to move
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   away.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.280]   And so $300,000 is more than my current passive income, and that provides some stress, but
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.760]   at least that gives me a goal to try to make more money by the time he goes to kindergarten.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.000]   Alright three, people will treat you a little weirdly.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.840]   Like you're a misfit or a miscreant.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.960]   You know, whether it's because retiring early is unconventional or because people are secretly
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.840]   jealous you aren't grinding away at a day job, people won't give you the same amount
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.680]   of respect as working class citizens.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.560]   After all, if they can't describe what you do for a living, then they can't pigeonhole
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.280]   you into an archetype that is comfortable for them.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.600]   Having a job means you are a productive member of society.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.920]   If you retire at a young age, people will assume you are simply slacking off and not
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.520]   paying your fair share of taxes.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.280]   They'll sometimes look at you as a leech they want to just flick off.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.840]   Further, if you're an outcast, then you won't be invited to parties or events that other
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.760]   working people always get to attend.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.680]   You're simply not top of mind to them.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.320]   So if you're an extrovert, early retirement will be more difficult than if you're an introvert.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.960]   So regards to what happened to me, after the first year of early retirement, I no longer
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.880]   told anybody I retired early.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.280]   Instead, I told them, you know, I was a writer or a tennis teacher or a fintech consultant
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.720]   or simply in between jobs.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.560]   Prior to that, I think a lot of people just assumed I was a trust fund baby who did not
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.000]   have to work and that's the last thing this middle class guy who attended public school
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.080]   wants to be known as.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.120]   My favorite time of the year was during the winter holidays.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.840]   I loved going to all the holiday parties and getting tipsy with fellow revelers.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:14.040]   Now I get invited to zero holiday parties because I don't work for anyone, nor do I
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.600]   get invited to client holiday parties either, even though I have several partners who are
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.080]   based in San Francisco Bay Area where Financial Samurai does really good business with them.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.920]   So it may sound silly or a little petty, but having a drink with good people with shared
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.160]   interests really means a lot to me because I am pretty extroverted.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   I would say like an eight out of 10.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.100]   And the thing is, since I've left, I've continued to pay tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.840]   thousands in taxes since because my online business has continued to grow and I sold
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.040]   my rental house, sold some investments.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.360]   So you know, I'm still paying my taxes, folks.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.880]   I'm not leeching off society.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.080]   I think I'm actually continuing to contribute to the redistribution of wealth in America.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.500]   Four, you'll be disappointed that you aren't much happier.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.120]   So many people think that once they achieve financial freedom or leave a job they dislike,
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.760]   they'll suddenly be permanently happier.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.600]   The truth of the matter is your elevated happiness will only last at most three to six months.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.840]   Three to six months, folks.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.640]   It's a good time, but it's not a permanent increase.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.520]   Eventually you'll revert to your natural state of being.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.120]   And if you don't believe me, just look back to your high school or college years when
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.040]   you didn't have any money at all.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.920]   I'd venture to guess you were just as happy as you are now, if not happier when you were
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.140]   a broke college student.
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.400]   So that happiness barometer doesn't fluctuate too much.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.040]   Having the freedom to do what you want is priceless, but you will eventually take your
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   freedom for granted like the air that you breathe every single day.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.440]   And during the times that you do feel kind of angry or annoyed or unhappy, you're going
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.240]   to feel like what's wrong with you since you have all this financial freedom and time?
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.840]   Just think about the citizens in the happiest countries in the world like Norway or Sweden.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.880]   They're always in the top five.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.080]   But imagine if you're not a happy person there.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.560]   Gosh, you'd probably feel like a loser.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.000]   So what's going on with me?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.120]   I thought I'd be much happier not having to report to a micromanager boss I did not respect.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.720]   I really didn't respect him.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.740]   He was kind of overweight.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.720]   He wasn't that smart.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.640]   And he just wasn't really charismatic at all.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.560]   But my happiness after I left my job was fleeting and only lasted about a week before I was
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.880]   back to my regular self.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.640]   One week, folks.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.300]   Instead of my happiness was weighed down by months of uncertainty on whether I'd made
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.800]   the right move to leave my job.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.680]   So although corporate politics no longer pissed me off, other things end up filling the void.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.520]   For example, drivers who decide to double park on a busy street in rush hour traffic
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.680]   really pissed me off.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.120]   Dog owners who decide to let their dogs poop in front of my house and not pick up after
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.320]   them really pissed me off.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.020]   So in the past, I could only allocate a small amount of annoyance to such incidences.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:13.400]   But now, my annoyance bucket has more capacity, so it just gets filled up by other things.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.800]   Instead of being at a permanently happier level, I'm simply no longer as annoyed or
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.200]   angry at things as frequently.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.560]   Further, the volatility around my steady state of happiness is lower.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.840]   So I guess in a sense, I'm more mellow.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.960]   Alright, fifth and finally about the negatives of early retirement.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.040]   You constantly wonder whether this is all there is to life.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.540]   Most of us spend 13 years going to grade school so we can spend 4 years in college in order
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.700]   to get a decent job.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.940]   Then we spend decades trying to earn and save money in order to provide for our family and
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.500]   then one day retire by 65.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:54.300]   With good luck, we'll live another 20+ years maybe and enjoy all the fruits of our labor.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.820]   So when you retire at a much earlier age, you're constantly left wondering what's
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.820]   next.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.540]   You are mentally twiddling your thumbs waiting for the next big thing while your close friends
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.080]   are all at work working at their purpose or so it seems.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.180]   Early retirement can get extremely mundane and boring because you have nobody to spend
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.240]   it with because they're all working.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.420]   So it can get really boring and as a result, you're repeatedly forced to will yourself
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.620]   into action.
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.680]   So this constant self-starting attitude can be very tiring to the point where you just
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.620]   want to rejoin the workforce and be told what to do.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.020]   So what's going on with me?
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.220]   Well, I totally thought to myself, "What's next?
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.220]   What's next?
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.140]   What's next?" for the first couple of years and I probably drove my wife nuts during the
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.660]   first 2 years of early retirement as well because I constantly told her I was bored.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.780]   Only boring people get bored, right?
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:49.380]   Well, I think that's wrong because everybody gets bored at some point and when you're working,
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.020]   you don't have time to get bored because you're working.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.640]   There's only so much tennis, golf, and softball I can play before my knees break and my shoulder
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.920]   gets strained and my lower back just can't move anymore.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.660]   And there are only so many churches to visit in Europe before they all start looking the
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.140]   same.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.620]   She used to have vacations from me, my wife did, because I was always away traveling for
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.140]   work once a month.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:17.340]   Now she sees me in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening because she too doesn't work
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.940]   because she's a stay-at-home mom which is a full-time job.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.580]   And so hey, it's great that we have 3 bedrooms.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.860]   Otherwise, I'm pretty sure we'd both have gone crazy from seeing each other so often.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:35.060]   It was only after our son was born in early 2017 that I felt a renewed sense of purpose.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.380]   Before my boy, I felt my purpose was to help educate as many readers as possible about
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.900]   personal finance in order to one day be free as well.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:49.060]   After my boy, my purpose has expanded to keeping Financial Samurai long enough to teach him
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.500]   about operating an online business out of fear he may have a tough time getting ahead.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.140]   And I fear this because he's a minority, he's mixed, he might have some issues with his
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.660]   vision, who knows?
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.900]   And you know, kids are cruel and life is really, really competitive due to the globalization
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.100]   of the world.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.960]   So with Financial Samurai, I can show him the ropes, I can talk to him about how to
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:19.100]   speak more eloquently perhaps with enough practice on my part, how to write good copy,
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:25.740]   how to be convincing in your prose, and how to, I don't know, build a brand and drive
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.020]   traffic to your site.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:32.300]   I think these are all good skills that everybody should have and now I just have to think,
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.420]   "Well, I got to make it last for at least 10 years or 15 years until he tells me, 'Dad,
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.940]   I don't want to learn any of this.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.900]   I want to be a guitar player,'" which would be pretty cool.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.500]   Hopefully he's pretty good at it.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.860]   In addition, I now need to live long enough until he finds someone who loves him as much
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.360]   as I love my wife.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.460]   I don't think I'd be able to die in peace if there was nobody to replace his mom or
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.460]   me.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.740]   I would really, really hope that he finds someone, hey, maybe it's a high school sweetheart.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:07.500]   Then I'd only have to wait, hmm, maybe 13 to 17 more years until he finds someone, settles
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.580]   down and lives happily ever after.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.780]   That would be awesome.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:16.820]   So as a result of needing to live longer and living for him, I'm exercising more, I'm
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:24.020]   watching what I eat more carefully, and I'm meditating longer to keep my mind fresh.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.980]   So in conclusion, there's no doubt in my mind that early retirement is a worthwhile goal
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.340]   to pursue.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:35.540]   I strongly suggest you guys start building passive income sooner rather than later.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.860]   Having the freedom to do what you want cannot be overstated.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:45.260]   Just know that your mind will play games with your spirit during the first years after leaving
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.260]   work.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.900]   And some of you, frankly, won't be able to take the early retirement lifestyle and will
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.820]   end up going back to work.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.220]   Just know that with enough conditioning, you will eventually embrace your freedom.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.300]   Nobody I know who retired from corporate life early has stayed retired.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.140]   They've found their purpose, whether it's a different type of occupation, whether it's
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.420]   volunteering, whether it's doing something entrepreneurial, and in my case, writing and
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.740]   doing something entrepreneurial.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.140]   Once you find that purpose, you will take steps.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.280]   You'll take steps to ensure you remain free forever.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.180]   So good luck everyone on your financial independence journey.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:29.380]   I promise you, I promise you, you will not regret sacrificing things today for the freedom,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.300]   the freedom you will enjoy tomorrow.
