[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.660]   in the right direction.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.220]   For this episode, I wanted to explore some philosophical arguments for God.
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.740]   As one might imagine, this is a colossal topic, so what I'm going to be attempting to do,
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.260]   as really I attempt to do in just about every episode, is to really just give you the cookies.
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.540]   I'm going to give you the briefest of flyovers and then hand to you what I believe to be
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.120]   the most persuasive as it relates to philosophical arguments for God.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.220]   To begin with, I want to say Christian philosophers and/or philosophers who happen to be Christian
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.340]   have a divide as to what method is either the most persuasive or even mandated.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.860]   That is an entirely separate issue and I don't want to get you bogged down by it, but it's
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:41.020]   worth bringing up now because it will be relevant in the later portion of this episode.
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.340]   Understanding that this episode is devoted to the arguments themselves, let's go ahead
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.180]   and start off with some.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.540]   I'm going to give you several arguments for God, but leave you with what I believe to
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.460]   be the most persuasive and attempt to justify my position on that.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.460]   The first argument I want to present to you is the Kalam Cosmological Argument for God.
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.740]   The Kalam Cosmological Argument for God, Kalam is spelled K-A-L-A-M.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.260]   The Kalam Cosmological Argument for God could be summarized in its rudimentary parts as
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.380]   the following.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.900]   1.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.900]   Whatever begins to exist has a cause 2.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.100]   The universe began to exist 3.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.700]   Therefore the universe has a cause
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.940]   Let me say that again.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.540]   1.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.620]   Whatever begins to exist has a cause 2.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.580]   The universe began to exist 3.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.020]   Therefore the universe has a cause
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.520]   According to the Kalam Cosmological Argument for God, that cause is what we call God.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.940]   William Lane Craig, who is a Christian philosopher and apologist, he's the one that's popularized
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.180]   this particular argument and has added his own nuance to it and it goes on to make the
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.060]   case that the cause of the universe is a personal God as opposed to an impersonal one and the
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.420]   rationale behind that gets a little bit more technical so I won't be going into that.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.140]   I do find, however, that this argument in its rudimentary parts is pretty compelling
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.540]   since everything we know of has a cause and in fact it's hard to think of anything as
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.460]   not having one.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:44.140]   If we did think of anything, imaginary or not, as not having a cause, then at that point
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.940]   you really are delving into the realm of the eternal, aren't we?
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.420]   To give you an analogy, if I were to concede that the Big Bang Theory of the universe is
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.980]   how the universe as we know it came to be and that prior to that, the actual Big Bang,
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:10.660]   there were gaseous material floating in space and that just existed, what existed prior
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.820]   to the Big Bang?
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.160]   If you say, "Well, all the material that is necessary for life today," my next question
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.300]   then becomes, "Well, where did what was necessary for all of life today come from?
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.220]   What existed before that?
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.300]   What existed before space to come into being?"
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.100]   Even given all the preconditions for an atheistic universe, the answer I've always gotten is
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.860]   some form of, "Well, it always existed."
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.220]   And do you know what that sounds like?
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.660]   That is just an AKA for "eternal."
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.500]   And that sounds pretty religious, doesn't it?
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.940]   But what choice does the atheist have?
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.220]   Again, I'm not assaulting the atheist, I'm stating logical conclusions.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.220]   And don't get me wrong, I've heard other answers to explain away the concept of eternality
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.700]   from a materialistic standpoint, AKA "always existed," but it's never amounted to what
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.500]   I would categorize as a good answer.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.860]   If you are honest and unbiased, the atheist is left with blind faith.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.540]   And I call it blind faith because there's no actual evidence that the material necessary
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:33.060]   for the universe has always existed, always existed being an AKA for "eternal."
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.260]   But even then, the atheistic universe needs to be dressed with religious garb.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.980]   In other words, for the Big Bang Theory to work, it needs to borrow capital from atheistic
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.540]   worldview.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.620]   If you want to go deeper into the Kalam Cosmological Argument for God, I would point you towards
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.760]   William Lane Craig over at Reasonable Faith.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.900]   The next philosophical argument for God that I found compelling is an age-old one that
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.660]   I've found to really have stood the test of time.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.860]   We've all heard this argument in some way, shape, or form.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:23.020]   The technical term for it is the teleological argument for God, the teleological argument
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.200]   for God, AKA the argument from design.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.060]   If you've read some form of this argument, it was probably from William Paley, and it
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.260]   was called the Watchmaker Argument, the Watchmaker Argument.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.480]   It goes something like the following.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.900]   If you found a watch outside an isolated cornfield or some other remote part of the world, you
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:54.340]   would naturally assume that someone made that watch despite you finding it in a remote area,
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:02.380]   as opposed to the watch just naturally, spontaneously, and randomly coming together to form a watch
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.980]   over millions of years.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.980]   You wouldn't entertain the possibility of disorder to order.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.940]   You wouldn't entertain the possibility of random metal pieces working as levers and
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.900]   pulleys to come together to form a designed unit that has a specific purpose that also
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.220]   accords with the sun and the moon.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.220]   You would think to yourself that someone made that watch, and that person has the requisite
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.220]   level of intelligence to do so, and some other person in possession of said watch must have
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.300]   somehow dropped it where you found it, or that person is the same person.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:48.420]   Either way, there is creative and intelligent design behind that watch.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:58.180]   The argument then from this looks at the vastness and complexity of the universe, and reasons
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.860]   from the same.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.700]   The vastness and complexity of the universe.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.300]   Using the vastness of the universe to illustrate this point, did you know that previous estimates
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.380]   used to put the number of galaxies in our universe at 200 billion?
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.900]   Current estimates now put the number of galaxies in our universe at around 2 trillion.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.380]   To give you a size comparison, our galaxy, the galaxy that we are currently in, the Milky
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:33.540]   Way, is about 100,000 light years in diameter, and we are in a relatively small galaxy.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.500]   A light year is the distance light travels in a year.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:45.740]   So the Milky Way is 100,000 light years in diameter, we are in a relatively small galaxy,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:53.540]   and there are about 2 trillion galaxies in our universe.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.700]   Regarding complexity, let's just take a look at our solar system.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:03.780]   In order for life to exist, the earth needs to rotate at a certain angle, must rotate
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:09.660]   at a certain speed, must be such and such a distance from the sun, the sun needs to
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.500]   radiate a certain amount of heat, or else we'll all die from heat, or we'll all just
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   freeze to death, the moon and the other planets also need to be at such a distance to the
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.020]   earth, there are also certain physical constraints in our universe that needs to maintain their
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:33.260]   exactness, there's 23 of them, you couple this with the complex cellular machinery that
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:40.380]   is inherent in all living organisms, not just human beings, in all living organisms, and
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:49.060]   you begin to see a level of design completely outside human comprehension.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:55.620]   A watch might be complicated, but it certainly doesn't even come close to the level of
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:04.020]   complexity and power associated with the universe and all that is in it.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:09.780]   If we look at a watch and say to ourselves, based on the design inherent in a watch, of
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.420]   course there was an intelligent being behind the creation of that watch, then why wouldn't
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:20.260]   the same thought process apply to the material universe?
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.420]   Moreover you see this line of thinking echoed in the scriptures.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:32.780]   Listen to Job 38, chapter 38, verses 4 through 12, Job 38, 4 through 12, it says this, "Where
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.220]   were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?"
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.740]   This is God talking to Job, "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.420]   Tell me if you have understanding.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.120]   Who set its measurements, since you know?
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.780]   Or who stretched the measuring line over it?
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.140]   On what were its bases sunk?
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.980]   Or who laid its cornerstone?
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.860]   When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.660]   Or who enclosed the sea with doors when it went out from the womb bursting forth?
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.100]   When I made a cloud its garment and thick darkness its swaddling bands, and I placed
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.580]   boundaries on it and set up bolts and doors, and I said, 'As far as this point ye shall
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.540]   come, but no farther, and here your proud waves shall stop.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:23.500]   Have you ever in your life commanded the morning and made the dawn know its place?'"
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:30.040]   That is God talking to Job in Job chapter 38, verses 4 through 12.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:36.140]   Consider also Romans chapter 1, 18 to 21, Romans chapter 1, 18 to 21, "For the wrath
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:42.220]   of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.300]   who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.300]   within them.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.520]   For God made it evident to them.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.180]   For since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:02.300]   divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.180]   that they are without excuse.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.020]   For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.620]   became futile in their reasonings, and their senseless hearts were darkened."
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.400]   From these passages, one can make a colorable argument that the teleological argument for
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:31.820]   God doesn't have its roots in human philosophy, but is also rooted in the scriptures themselves.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.820]   I want to move on to the last argument I'll be addressing, and this is the argument that
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.180]   I find the most persuasive.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.260]   Although I find it the most persuasive, I also find it the most difficult to grasp,
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.660]   the most difficult to articulate, the most difficult to convey, and yet the most, in
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:56.500]   accordance with the scriptures, I find it to be the most powerful philosophically.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.860]   This argument is called the transcendental argument for God.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:08.820]   The transcendental argument for God, it's known in other circles as presuppositionalism.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.140]   One of the several reasons why I find this argument so persuasive, and I want to highlight
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:22.620]   is that it portrays and magnifies the absolute myth of ideological neutrality.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.460]   The absolute myth of ideological neutrality.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.820]   I can't unpack that here because of time, and maybe I'll circle back around to it one
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.540]   day and do an episode solely devoted to that topic, but let me say it again.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.700]   It portrays and magnifies the myth of ideological neutrality.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:49.460]   We readily assume that when engaging in truth claims, when investigating truth claims, the
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:55.140]   fair way to go about investigating and dialoguing about such claims is that we take an unbiased
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:02.340]   approach and that unbiased approach must necessarily entail ideological neutrality.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.420]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:08.980]   We should take an unbiased approach, but my point is that unbiased approach, that desire
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:16.980]   to take that approach, we think necessarily entails ideological neutrality.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:23.700]   Once you dig deep enough into this topic, you begin to realize that ideological neutrality
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:31.300]   is impossible, not because I want it to be, but because it just is.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.600]   Hopefully after examining this argument, you'll have a better grasp of why.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.220]   So let's do that right now.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.940]   Going back to the transcendental argument for God, a form of it was arguably espoused
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:48.980]   first by Immanuel Kant, but the true substance of the argument was first formulated by Cornelius
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.980]   Van Til.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.140]   So some people will tell you that Immanuel Kant was the first one.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   I disagree.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.020]   I'm not going to get into that.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:03.300]   The first to formulate this in its substance, in my opinion, is Cornelius Van Til.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:10.780]   It was then sharpened, popularized, and then elaborated by Dr. Greg Bonson.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.780]   I will spend the rest of this episode trying my best to unpack this argument, while not
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.300]   getting bogged down with the details, but you're really going to have to put your thinking
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.220]   caps on.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.380]   The payoff, in my opinion, is worth it.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.580]   The transcendental argument for God states the following.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:37.640]   We can prove the existence of God from the impossibility of the contrary.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:45.960]   We can prove the existence of God from the impossibility of the contrary.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:54.940]   We can prove the existence of God from the impossibility of the contrary.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:03.940]   The transcendental proof for God's existence is that without Him, it is impossible to prove
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.820]   anything.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:13.680]   The transcendental proof for God's existence is that without Him, it is impossible to prove
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.820]   anything.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:21.840]   The problem is, if we're going to speak about the proof of the existence of God because
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.400]   of the impossibility of the contrary, that calls into question the very nature of the
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.660]   evidence that is going to be proposed to show such impossibility.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:39.120]   To illustrate this, I'm going to be speaking from three key areas, addressing three key
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:49.600]   areas, and those three key areas are the uniformity of science, the universal laws of logic, objective
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.180]   morality.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:58.340]   The uniformity of science, the universal laws of logic, objective morality.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.680]   Here's an example of what I mean by that.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:07.240]   If I were to tell you that my car is outside and you don't believe me, then in response
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.900]   to that, what could I say?
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.280]   What could I do to prove it to you?
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.680]   What do you think will resolve our question, our dilemma?
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:23.080]   You just go outside to verify whether or not my car is parked on your grass, right?
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.080]   It's observational.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:30.560]   A car is a material object observable by the naked eye, so if you have a genuine question
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.920]   about whether or not my statement is true that, "Hey, my car is parked on your grass,"
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.360]   all you do is get up and go and look at your grass and see whether or not my car is there.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:48.640]   However, if we're going to prove the existence of gravity, we don't prove gravity the same
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.760]   way we prove whether or not my car is parked on your grass.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.400]   What if the question were the following?
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:05.080]   Is murdering all people, no matter what, when they turn 8 years old, objectively wrong?
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.800]   What if that were the question as opposed to gravity or my car being parked on your
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.160]   grass?
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:19.360]   Is murdering all people, no matter what, when they turn 8 years old, objectively wrong?
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:28.320]   We don't address every single question in the same way we address whether or not my
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.840]   car is parked on your grass.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.320]   How about this question?
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:41.400]   Is the Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh a beautiful painting?
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:50.920]   Are the acoustics in the Hagia Sophia mesmerizing?
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:57.240]   Again, you wouldn't go about answering these questions in the same way you would go about
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.800]   answering whether or not my car is parked on your grass.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:13.280]   The reason you don't is because different questions naturally call for a different set
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.880]   of criteria to answer those questions.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.280]   You don't say the Starry Night is a beautiful painting merely because you see it.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.460]   You don't say the acoustics in the Hagia Sophia are great merely because you hear it.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.000]   If any of you listening are familiar with philosophy, we are now beginning to delve
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.600]   into the realm of epistemology and metaphysics.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.160]   If you don't know what those words mean, don't worry about it.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   That's okay.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.180]   I'm going to try to break down what I'm saying into very small pieces.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:50.500]   They're fancy words, but don't be fearful of fancy words.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:20:00.360]   If we are then going to engage in a debate about the existence of God, the factual criteria
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:08.840]   that is going to be employed to have such a discussion is crucial and yes, even foundational
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.340]   to our discussion.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:16.720]   Undoubtedly, we're going to agree that the use of logic and reason is going to be paramount
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.160]   to having such a discussion and engaging in such an inquiry.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:32.480]   Here's the thing though, why does the atheist or other non-Christian theist get to presuppose
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.440]   the universal laws of logic?
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.760]   Why do they get to presuppose that?
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.080]   Now that might seem like a silly question to the vast majority of laymen out there.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:47.400]   However, this is a righteously investigated question by those in the philosophy community,
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.360]   especially those who focus on the nature of logic.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.820]   The reason being is this, if in the eyes of the materialist, the only thing that is real
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:02.560]   is what you see with your eyes and everything that exists went from a state of disorder
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:08.600]   to order, then why are laws of logic universal?
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.920]   How do you know what they are?
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.240]   How do you know they don't change and stay constant?
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.960]   For the Christian, the reasoning is simple.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.280]   Our God is a God of order and the universal laws of logic reflect who he is.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.280]   This is his world.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.720]   He created it.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.400]   The universal laws of logic reflect him.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:33.360]   Again, this goes to my earlier point that the existence of God is proven by the impossibility
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.200]   of the contrary.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:43.900]   For the atheist and the other non-Judeo-Christian theist, how do you prove the universal laws
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.740]   of logic?
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:57.600]   You need another vehicle to resolve this dialectical inquiry.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:07.800]   You are forced to presuppose that the laws of logic exist and are universal and/or that
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.760]   the laws of logic prove that the laws of logic should be used.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.200]   But you see, that's a real dilemma here because you've now engaged in circular reasoning without
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.680]   providing any justification for such.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.560]   It's not that the circular reasoning in itself is inherently wrongful because you need a
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:38.000]   mechanism to delineate that, but my point is you haven't provided any justification
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.940]   for such circular reasoning to be accepted for the Christian.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:53.840]   In the Judeo-Christian worldview, the universal laws of logic exist because it reflects who
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.480]   God is.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:04.600]   If you were to dig deeper into the atheistic philosophy community or even the non-Christian
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:12.280]   theistic philosophy community, they acknowledge they have real problems here.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.160]   To give you further proof of this, if you wikipedia "law of non-contradiction" and
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:23.600]   you scroll near the bottom of the page under "alleged impossibility of its proof or denial,"
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:30.440]   you'll see that the first sentence reads, "As is true of all axioms of logic, the law
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:36.960]   of non-contradiction is alleged to be neither verifiable nor falsifiable on the grounds
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:44.420]   that any proof or disproof must use the law itself prior to reaching the conclusion.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:50.800]   In other words, in order to verify or falsify the laws of logic, one must resort to logic
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:58.160]   as a weapon, an act which would essentially be self-defeating."
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.960]   I understand that wikipedia is not an authoritative source, but I'm trying to show you that
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.200]   what I'm stating isn't some controversy I just made up.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.800]   But it's a real pickle for those who have thought deeply about the universal laws of
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.840]   logic.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.640]   If you were to click on the source supporting that portion of the wikipedia article on the
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:24.240]   law of non-contradiction, it takes you to a paper written by a philosopher named S.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:31.560]   Mark Cohen entitled "Aristotle on the Principle of Non-Contradiction."
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:39.400]   My point being again that if philosophers see that all axioms of logic are neither verifiable
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:47.080]   nor falsifiable because in order to prove them, you have to use them, then they must
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.760]   be presupposed.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.920]   The presuppositional argument isn't some weird Christian invention, it's a confessed
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:01.840]   observation by those who are not ashamed to omit what is right in front of them.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.400]   To those who are not ashamed to just follow the evidence and see where it takes them.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:16.200]   And it is completely consistent with the triune God of the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:22.240]   To quote a couple verses here to elucidate this thought, let me read to you firstly Isaiah
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   118.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.640]   "Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.080]   Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.920]   Though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool."
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   Reason together.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.600]   God is calling one to reason because we have the capacity to reason.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:48.360]   We have the capacity to reason because every human being that has ever lived was made in
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.080]   the image of God.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:57.560]   Listen to Romans 2 14-15, "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.480]   the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.120]   They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.680]   bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them."
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:19.840]   Here Paul is telling us that there is something inherent within the makeup of mankind that
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.720]   bears witness using the dialogue of accusation and permission.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:32.960]   Intrinsic in this interplay is reason, which is consistent with Isaiah 118.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:45.240]   Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 14-33 Paul writes, "For God is not a God of confusion, but of
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   peace."
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.560]   God is not haphazard, without composure, and just all over the place.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.360]   Paul goes on to state in verse 40, "But all things must be done properly and in an orderly
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   way."
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.880]   Paul is stating this because it reflects how God desires worship to be done, and people
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:10.480]   benefit more when things are done in an orderly way, in particular when worship is done in
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.960]   an orderly manner, again reflecting on God's nature.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   You see the inherent quality of objective reason in God's prescriptions and directives.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.760]   This is not just something I'm making up pie in the sky by and by.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:35.640]   You can't say that the material universe is all there is, and then turn around and say,
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.680]   "Well, there's this abstract entity that's universal, and we can't see it, but it also
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   exists."
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:47.600]   That's the very opposite of the material universe you just espoused.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.680]   Some will then say, "Well, the laws of logic are agreed upon conventionally, but the problem
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.840]   is we all know that the laws of logic are objectively real, they're universal, they're
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.400]   not conventional, because then they would change and they wouldn't be constant.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.880]   They don't exist because they're popular."
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.800]   Others will say that they are merely thoughts that all men share.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.480]   The problem with that is that the laws of logic are rooted in reality.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.720]   They're not some illusion that we all see.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.640]   We can't even agree whether or not the dress is blue or gold.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:28.600]   So we see and we use the universal laws of logic, not only in everyday life, but to make
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.160]   cars, to make trains, to make planes, and those cars get us to point A to B. Those trains
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.000]   take us along the coast, and those planes fly us all around the world.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.800]   What you have to understand is that the Bible claims that God is not only the God of those
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   who believe, but rather, he created everything that we see, and it reflects, reality does,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.200]   it reflects who he is.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.000]   God made this world, this is his reality, and when we go against his reality, it has
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.600]   a way of snapping back at us.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.520]   That is true not only for the Christian, but for everyone, and for anyone who has ever
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.840]   lived.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.600]   Let me illustrate this point because I know it's hard to grasp.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.660]   An example of this would be gravity.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.760]   Try not believing in gravity.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.980]   It's not something you can see, but try not believing in gravity.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.720]   Try jumping off of a story.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.680]   You won't get very far.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:41.200]   Again, science is uniform, and it behaves with a high degree of certainty, and the Christian
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.680]   understands this because this reflects who God is.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.620]   Science is able to progress for these reasons.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:59.200]   The great philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn, K-U-H-N, understood this, and to the extent
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.640]   that it matters, I don't think he was a Christian.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.840]   Christians have no problem presupposing this, and contrary to popular perception, it is
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:16.240]   not anti-intellectual to presuppose such notions because the existence of all things, including
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:24.280]   this conversation, is proven by the impossibility of the contrary, namely, a universe that exists
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.440]   without the Christian God.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   Revelation is greater than reason precisely because reason is born out of revelation.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.800]   Understanding worldview claims, then, when examined at their roots, have their conflicts
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:49.360]   resolved by perceiving the impossibility of the contrary.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:55.840]   My point is maybe still hard to grasp, and so I'm going to try to bring it together with
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:04.400]   this last example because I think what we're talking about here, we don't really grapple
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:12.920]   with it as much, but then when we do grapple with this next example, it is something we
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.480]   deal with routinely, and that is objective morality.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.040]   We might not routinely deal with, in an abstract level, the universal laws of logic and the
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:31.920]   uniformity of science, but we routinely deal with the objectivity of morality.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:42.840]   There are things, there are some things, that are always wrong, even when an entire culture,
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.160]   even when the entire world says differently.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.600]   Is that not true?
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.120]   Don't we agree that morality is objective?
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:32:00.600]   There are certain crimes, certain conduct, if I were to articulate, even if the whole
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:07.360]   world agreed it's not wrong, because morality is objective, we would agree that it's wrong.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:17.320]   If everyone in the entire world got together and made a statement declaring that all eight-year-olds,
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.840]   regardless of any other factor, should be put to death, again, not based on anything
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:31.000]   they did or said, but merely because they are eight-years-old, even if the entire world
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.720]   said that's okay, we would say that it is still wrong.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:44.080]   We would agree that morality is not based on convention.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.960]   If you disagree, that's fine, but you're saying, whether you like it or not, that morality
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:59.720]   is based on convention, then by logical implication, Nazi Germany was fine, Pol Pot was fine, Kim
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:05.400]   Il-sung was fine, Mussolini was fine, Stalin and Lenin were good dudes, but nobody would
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.960]   say that.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.360]   Nobody would say that.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:17.400]   Does nobody say that because morality is based on convention, or is there something we see
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:25.960]   to one degree or another that speaks to us in our conscience and tells us that morality
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.560]   is not subjective and based on convention?
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:36.240]   It is objective, it is fixed, it is constant.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:44.080]   We might disagree on the perception of it, but wouldn't it be correct to say that morality
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:51.400]   is objective and we should be doing our best to ascertain what it is, rather than meting
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.000]   it out for ourselves?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.760]   For the Christian, to define morality as objective is simple.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.840]   Morality is a reflection of the Judeo-Christian God.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.560]   Morality is a reflection of who God is.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.920]   That's why it is objective, fixed, and constant.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.480]   It is immaterial.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.640]   We can't see it, but it is still objective.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.000]   It is still there.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.180]   And all the convention in the world, the entire world, all of mankind agreeing that it is
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.320]   something else wouldn't change it.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.160]   Everybody has inherent value because everybody is made in the image of God and nothing we
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.040]   could do could change that.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.400]   So even if the whole world says murdering 8 year olds is good, it is not good because
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:52.880]   morality isn't based upon convention, popular opinion, or other subjective changing whims.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.080]   It is based on God who never changes and who has absolute authority.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.060]   And we live in his world, this is his reality, and when you violate this objective morality,
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.080]   it inevitably has a way of snapping back at you.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:15.000]   It might not happen as swiftly as gravity, but it will inevitably happen.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.320]   Try sleeping with a married man's wife and see what happens.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.680]   Try committing to a life of stealing and see what happens.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:26.880]   Try lying to everyone anytime you want to get out of a sticky situation and see what
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.160]   happens.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:37.400]   You will feel the effects of it at some point and maybe even right away.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.040]   You cannot see morality, but it is still objective.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.520]   It is a reflection of who God is.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.820]   Just like the laws of logic.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.880]   You don't see it, but you know that they are universal.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:36:02.200]   And when you apply the universal laws of logic, it corresponds to reality.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.780]   Science is uniform.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:13.040]   Science is uniform because God created the universe, this is his reality, and he fashioned
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   it as such.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.760]   I want to do a quick segue here regarding the so-called problem of evil because it's
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.480]   got to be addressed, it's an issue that many people have with respect to the existence
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   of God.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:41.060]   I'm going to say this, when you say there is evil in the world, and what you're saying
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.380]   is that there is also good.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.180]   When you say there is evil, you are saying there is also good.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.500]   Because you need some sort of basis to differentiate between good and evil.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.700]   Therefore, when you say there is evil, you are saying there is a moral law.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:01.100]   Because there is some type of moral law to differentiate between good and evil.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.860]   If there is a moral law, then there is a moral law giver.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:12.980]   But once you say there is evil, you just proved the very thing you are trying to disprove.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.100]   Evil is not resolved by discounting God.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:25.220]   The existence and problem of evil only proves the existence of God, and any logical answer
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:31.220]   with respect to the problem of evil may only be resolved with the existence of God and
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:37.020]   not by his absence.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.980]   So if this is indeed the case, the point to be made here is that the transcendental argument
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:49.100]   for God proves the existence of God by the impossibility of the contrary.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:54.100]   Without God, we don't have uniformity of nature, uniformity of science, the universal laws
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.860]   of logic, or objective morality.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:02.140]   Outside of the Judeo-Christian God, we cannot account for this conversation.
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:06.700]   I want to keep illustrating this.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:13.500]   If the Big Bang Theory is true, and the universe somehow existed in complete chaos, then what
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:20.460]   would follow is that we go from disorder to order, not uniformity.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.820]   Laws of logic wouldn't be universal.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.820]   They'd be conventional.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.460]   They'd always be changing.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:31.260]   The atheistic universe cannot account for a universe where the immaterial laws of logic
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.460]   apply everywhere in the same way on the same plane of thought.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:40.700]   It certainly doesn't account for objective morality.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:45.140]   You don't see a council of monkeys ordering civilization against cannibalism.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:49.340]   Some monkeys just eat other monkeys, and for further development of that, just see episode
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.700]   3.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.900]   The transcendental argument for God rightly hits you in all the right places, and that
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:01.580]   is the very foundation of all that we know and see.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:09.060]   To merely assume objectivity in immaterial space, when you claim to only believe in the
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:14.420]   material, is disingenuous, arbitrary, and unfounded.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:22.020]   The atheist must admit that he is being religious, and he's taking quite on faith the immaterial
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:30.140]   universe that he is so vehemently trying to deny, or else just admit that the laws of
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:36.420]   logic are not universal, they might not exist, they might be just convention, there are thought
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.180]   patterns within our head, that morality is not objective, so might makes right, and you
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:47.180]   cannot logically decry some of the greatest injustices that have occurred throughout history.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:53.980]   David Hume's skepticism of science wherein he states that there is no rational basis
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:40:02.140]   for expecting the future to be like the past, in which case science is based simply on convention,
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.980]   or if you will, habits of thought.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.660]   Admit that David Hume was right.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.380]   Admit that Thomas Kuhn was right.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:13.660]   And these men were not Christians, David Hume, Thomas Kuhn, they were not, as far as I know,
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:20.140]   they were not Christians, but were honest philosophers who saw the implications of a
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.780]   purely materialistic universe.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:30.700]   But for the person who takes the Bible as the word of God, there is open to that person
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:37.380]   an extraordinary amount of evidence that even certifies that person's belief, that bolsters
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.380]   it.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:44.220]   That person reads in the scriptures that God is kind to all, even to those that do
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:49.140]   not believe, that he sends the sun and the rain on the righteous and the unrighteous,
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.460]   that he gives common grace to all, that he created the world with a certain objective
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.820]   reality that we see.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.100]   Individuals learn about societies that try and repel against this moral reality, and
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.180]   they see what happens when they do.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.580]   That he fashioned the universe in a way that is consistent with who he is, as God himself
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.300]   claims to be a God of order.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:18.220]   Moreover, we see that God at times either suspended or intervened in his own creation
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:24.900]   the natural laws that we see to demonstrate his power and his kindness.
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:30.780]   Jesus of Nazareth showed a sampling of this suspension to demonstrate his own claims to
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:38.380]   deity, and we go through this reality experiencing the profitability that comes with obeying
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:46.580]   him, whether it's through the realm of science, logic, or morality.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:55.060]   To drive the point home again, it is only the Judeo-Christian God that has shown himself
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:42:03.820]   to be this way, and that is why the transcendental argument for God only works for the triune
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.620]   God of the scriptures.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.440]   It is not merely a theistic argument.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:21.940]   The triune God of the scriptures is a different God from every other religious text.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:31.540]   The existence of God is proven by the impossibility of the contrary.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:38.580]   First Corinthians chapter 1, 18-20 states it like this, "For the word of the cross
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:45.820]   is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:51.860]   of God, for it is written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.'
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.860]   And the understanding of those who have understanding I will confound."
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.300]   Where is the wise person?
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.700]   Where is the scribe?
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.820]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:15.780]   Has God not made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.460]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:22.460]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:50.060]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:57.620]   Amen.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.200]   (upbeat music)
