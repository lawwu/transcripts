[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.120]   - Welcome back.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.360]   The weekend is over and we're back to work,
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.120]   back to work thinking about work,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.160]   particularly how we can be most fruitful
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.120]   by leaning on strong administrative structures
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.560]   that we need in place.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.660]   We've never talked about this angle of leadership
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.740]   on the podcast, so it should be interesting.
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.600]   How do we build the structures we need
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.000]   so that we can fulfill our calling in the world?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.080]   The topic is relevant, of course, for ministries
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.640]   and relevant for Christian business leaders
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.660]   and relevant for healthcare providers too.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.280]   In fact, today's question comes from a doctor
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.880]   who writes this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.660]   "I've greatly enjoyed Ask Pastor John over the years.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.120]   "Thank you for blessing and strengthening my faith
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.400]   "in Jesus Christ."
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.120]   My question is this.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.480]   I'm a doctor.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.040]   I've tried to live and serve by 1 Peter 4, verses 10 to 11.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.720]   However, I'm also the practice owner.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.760]   My family and our two dozen employees and their families
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.900]   all financially depend on the profitability of our practice.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.600]   Increasingly, I find my thoughts and efforts consumed
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.720]   by the profit-seeking aspects of running a business.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.400]   Biblically, is there a way for me to reconcile
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.640]   a God-honoring attention to patient care
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.920]   with my responsibility as a business owner
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.720]   to generate a profit so that employees
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.800]   can provide for their families?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.760]   Pastor John, what would you say to this doctor?
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760]   Well, the answer to that last question is yes.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   There is a way to reconcile a God-honoring attention
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.040]   to patient care with the responsibility of the clinic owner
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.800]   to manage the affairs of the clinic in such a way
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.920]   that it remains financially viable.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.800]   That is, remains in existence.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.380]   It may be that you don't need to primarily talk
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.520]   in categories of care versus profit,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.260]   but maybe in the categories of clinic existence
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.280]   and clinic care.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.440]   In other words, perhaps the way to think of these two sides
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   of the clinic's life is that there are two kinds of care,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.880]   not care versus something else,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.600]   but two kinds of care that one must attend to
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.520]   in order for patients to be helped.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   One is the immediate care of diagnosis and treatment
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.960]   for all the maladies that people come to the clinic with.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.160]   And the other kind of care is to see to it
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.100]   that the very possibility of diagnosis and treatment exists,
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.360]   namely a clinic with doctors and resources
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.200]   that they require to do the healing work
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.060]   that they're called to do.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.880]   These are really two forms of caring, aren't they?
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.560]   Now, admittedly, the one is more immediate
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   and feels more like care because the doctor
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.600]   or the nurse is sitting face-to-face with a sick patient
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.660]   and talking about how healing might be pursued.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.740]   But if there were no clinic to come to
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.680]   and no doctors and nurses and laboratory staff
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   to follow through with, the diagnosis and the treatment
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.400]   wouldn't have any effect or they wouldn't even happen.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.060]   So the more immediate care is dependent
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.600]   on the more general, broad, behind-the-scenes care,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.200]   the business side of the clinic,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   which must take into account costs of rent
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.400]   and utilities and upkeep and sophisticated medical devices
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.960]   and receptionists and scheduling and insurance reports
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.640]   and computer support, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.960]   One can feel why our friend would begin to feel submerged
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.920]   under that kind of demand,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.920]   but they really are two essential forms of care giving,
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.940]   even if it's less direct in one way
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.960]   and more direct in another.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.660]   If the clinic goes out of existence
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.560]   because of poor management, poor pricing structures,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.400]   poor collections, poor planning for patient load,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.100]   everyone suffers and care ceases.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.100]   So let me say a word to the actual inner struggle
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.120]   the doctor is feeling as he wrestles
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.840]   with these two kinds of care.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   He says, quote, "Increasingly, I find my thoughts
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.540]   and efforts consumed by the profit-seeking aspects
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.260]   of running a business."
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.260]   Now, how many pastors, how many educators, teachers,
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.020]   how many leaders of, say, inner-city ministries
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.060]   have felt this very same sense of being consumed
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.300]   by the financial and structural demands
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.300]   that undergird a ministry?
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.880]   On the one hand, while they long to be doing
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.480]   face-to-face actual ministry or teaching or counseling,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.000]   to people on the other hand, there's nothing unique,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.360]   it seems to me, about a medical practice
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.600]   in that kind of struggle.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.340]   This is true of churches, it's true of schools,
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.080]   it's true of all kinds of ministries.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.880]   For example, a book was published some years ago
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.100]   by Colin Marshall and Tony Payne
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.540]   called "The Trellis and the Vine."
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.120]   The description of the point of the book goes like this.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   All Christian ministry, and you could say the same thing
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.840]   about a lot of secular service providers, I'm sure,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   all Christian ministry is a mixture of trellis and vine.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.860]   There's vine work, the prayerful preaching,
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.780]   teaching of the word of God to see people converted,
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.980]   grow into maturity as disciples of Christ,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.500]   and there's the trellis work,
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.580]   creating and maintaining the physical,
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.440]   organizational structures and programs
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   that support the vine work and its growth.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.660]   And then they ask, the authors ask,
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.660]   has trellis work taken over for you and your ministry?
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.000]   Has it begun to consume you?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It does, they say, it does have the habit of doing that.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.200]   Now in Acts chapter six,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.940]   the apostles were about to be overwhelmed,
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.820]   consumed by the demands of trellis work,
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.480]   providing the personnel and structures
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.960]   for the distribution of the food among the widows
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.860]   when the apostles need to be giving themselves
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.740]   to the vine work of the word of God and prayer.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.660]   And the remedy for that was the putting in place
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.660]   of gifted people who are really good at trellis work
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.380]   in order to free the apostles to do the vine work
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.560]   that they were called to do.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.060]   I recall very personally when our church
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.060]   got to a certain size and I was about to be consumed,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.220]   overwhelmed as the lead pastor,
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.380]   and we put in place for the first time
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.540]   in the history of the church,
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.880]   an executive pastor alongside me.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.160]   And that resulted, I would say,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   in 20 more years of flourishing as a staff and church.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.880]   And then eventually we put in place financial specialists
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.200]   who could handle all kinds of complex workings
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.500]   behind the scenes of a growing church and so on.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   All Christian ministry and even secular service providers,
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.960]   all of it is a mixture of trellis and vine.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.980]   There's vine work, hands-on, face-to-face meeting
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.580]   of people's needs, and there's trellis work
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.020]   creating, maintaining the financial organizational
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.720]   structures that support the vine work.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.480]   So maybe I could sum up my counsel
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   to this beleaguered doctor with four statements.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.280]   First, view both the trellis work and the vine work,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.880]   the financial structural work and the diagnostic
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.300]   and treatment of patients face-to-face,
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   view them as two kinds of love, two kinds of care.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   Second, put in place gifted people who are really good
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.020]   at the kind of business management your clinic requires
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.700]   in order to free up medical staff
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.360]   to do their more immediate care.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.680]   This is right at the heart of what Peter was saying
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.520]   in 1 Peter 4:10, "As each has received a gift,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.620]   "use it to serve one another as good stewards
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.280]   "of God's varied grace."
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.100]   The diversity of gifts for maintaining the viability
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.100]   of a clinic or a church or a school or ministry is crucial.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.080]   Pray that God would lead really gifted people
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.380]   to do the kind of specialized tasks
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.380]   that a complicated clinic or business or ministry requires.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   Third, don't ever do evil that good may come.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.340]   That's a quote from Romans 3, 8.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.340]   That is, don't try to justify dishonest business practices
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.940]   because they will keep the clinic alive
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.140]   for the sake of love, for the sake of patients and employees.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.700]   God will not honor the cutting of corners,
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.260]   the loss of integrity in order to do good.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.300]   There's always a way to help people
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.000]   by doing the right thing.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.480]   And finally, I would say God has promised,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.620]   He really has, and He keeps this promise.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.620]   In Philippians 4, 19, He has promised to meet all our needs
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.720]   according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.480]   Trust Him, trust Him to do that,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.640]   and roll the burden that you feel
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.560]   for the complex side of this clinic.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.920]   Roll that burden onto the Lord.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.340]   George Mueller, who had to keep an infrastructure running
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.240]   to maintain thousands of orphans,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.960]   used to say when people asked him about his peacefulness,
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.820]   I rolled 60 burdens onto the Lord in prayer this morning.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.260]   I love that.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.940]   I want to be like that.
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.040]   So God bless you for bearing the burden
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.040]   of a medical clinic that serves both patients and employees,
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.860]   both by its immediate medical care
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.860]   and by its trellis-like financial viability.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.400]   May God give you the wisdom and the grace
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.100]   to put the people and the structures in place
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.840]   that enable you to do what you love to do,
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   and so find everybody flourishing in that great work.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.180]   Amen.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.480]   Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.

[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.480]   On Friday of last week in APJ 1869,
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.380]   we looked at the terrible things that Satan can do,
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.280]   do even to us as believers.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.480]   Satan brings physical suffering.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.200]   He's behind much sickness.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.840]   And we know Satan brought a thorn of physical pain
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.720]   into Paul's life.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.360]   Satan can even throw Christians into prison.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.980]   Satan is no joke.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.640]   And yet, there's only one deadly,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.120]   finally destructive weapon in the artillery of Satan.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   Only one lethal weapon he can wield over you and over me.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.420]   Pastor John will explain what that is on Wednesday.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.720]   We'll see you next time.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.880]   (upbeat music)
