[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.500]   So how do we continue on when this life feels pointless?
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.400]   Like when we are treading water
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.120]   and it just feels like we're passing time
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.280]   until this life is over.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.080]   It's a raw and honest question from Fred,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.440]   an older gentleman who does not give us his exact age,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.160]   but Fred wrote us to say this,
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.240]   "Pastor John, I avoid the thought
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.940]   "because I don't want to go down this path,
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.380]   "but deep within me I long for death
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.280]   "because it will release me from what I consider
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.580]   "so far to be a pretty joyless life.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.560]   "The joyful moments of relationship with God
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.800]   "seem to be few and far between now,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.940]   "and it just seems like my life
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.560]   "is really just a matter of passing time
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.140]   "until Jesus either returns or calls me home.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200]   "What advice can you give me?
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   "I feel really exhausted."
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.320]   The first thing I want to say to Fred
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.240]   is that growing weary with this world in old age
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.880]   is normal and good.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.880]   It's normal because our energy is being depleted by age,
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.360]   and it's good because in this broken world,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.760]   Christians are not really at home.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.120]   Our citizenship is in heaven,
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.560]   and we are designed as new creatures in Christ
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.920]   for a new heaven and a new earth with glorified bodies,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   so don't be too hard on yourself for feeling weariness
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880]   with this old, worn-out, dying, corrupt world.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.240]   You were made for something better, and it is coming.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   But what is sinful is letting our weariness
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.560]   become cynical or hopeless or joyless or meaningless,
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   so let me try to help Fred by just mentioning
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.040]   five or six things that might be an encouragement
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.960]   and a guidance.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.040]   First, keep the promises of God before your mind
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.880]   day and night.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.600]   Some of them are wonderfully designed
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.240]   for old people like us.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.040]   Here's what Isaiah 46.3 says.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.380]   "Listen to me, O house of Jacob,
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.400]   "all the remnant of the house of Israel
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.960]   "who have been born by me from before your birth,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.580]   "carried from the womb,
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.480]   "even to your old age I am he,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.320]   "and to gray hairs I will carry you.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.120]   "I have made and I will bear,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.360]   "I will carry and will save."
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.320]   In other words, the greatness of our God
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.840]   is not that he demands us to carry him
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.880]   like the Babylonian gods on carts,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.480]   but that he shows his strength in carrying us,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.320]   and the weaker we get, the more precious that promise is.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.760]   So keep the promises of God before your mind,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.580]   especially the ones designed for us.
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.960]   Number two, never forget that you are not
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.680]   still here by accident.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.560]   God gave you life and God will take your life.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.360]   The Lord gives and the Lord takes away.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.080]   Blessed be the name of the Lord, Job chapter one.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.960]   And God does nothing randomly or whimsically.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   He has gloriously wise reasons for everything he does,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.200]   even if we can't see them.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.140]   So you are still on this earth for a divine reason.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.000]   Your life is not meaningless.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.760]   You are not here by accident.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.640]   God is sovereign.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.880]   If he has you still here, he has good reasons.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.040]   Bank on it, trust him.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.960]   Three, don't medicate your sadness
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.500]   and weariness with television.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.480]   There are some things, I don't doubt,
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.200]   that may provide innocent and wholesome recreation
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.760]   for your mind, but they are so few,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.560]   and so far between.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.640]   Most television and most advertisements on television
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.920]   drag your soul away from Christ.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.600]   They don't promote holiness and purity
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.640]   and heavenly mindedness and nobility of soul.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.640]   They make you feel small and stupid and silly and childish.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.000]   So don't join the millions of old people
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   who simply vegetate in front of animated worldliness.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.840]   Number four, if you can read, read the Bible
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.760]   and read good books about God and his world.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   If you can't read, get somebody to help you
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.720]   get set up with audio books and listen to the Bible
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.360]   and listen to important books, great books,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.480]   insightful books, interesting books.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.560]   God has so much to teach us in our old age,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.520]   and we never lose our need of being reminded
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   of great things that we once knew and have now forgotten.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.080]   He has given us an utterly fascinating world
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.640]   to understand and enjoy.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.240]   So find a way to keep growing in your knowledge
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.960]   and in grace.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.040]   Fifth, be among God's people at church
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.800]   and ask the leaders of your church how you can serve
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.040]   given your limitations.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.680]   God created us, all of us, to be useful.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.400]   And one of the greatest frustrations of growing old
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.840]   is the sense of uselessness.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   But if you have any strength or any mobility left,
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.560]   you can find some way to serve.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.840]   And that's the last thing.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   Number six is kind of a sub point, I suppose, of number five.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   Find someone you can care for, give yourself to.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.280]   And that care may be as simple as reading to them
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.080]   or taking them for a walk or giving them a shoulder rub
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.880]   or showing an interest in their life.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.080]   There are always people who have needs.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.440]   And until we're paralyzed, in bed, unable to move,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.560]   we probably can make some small contribution
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.880]   to someone else's life.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.640]   You were made for that, Fred.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   You were made to love and serve.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.560]   So seek it out.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.840]   This is the path of joy because Jesus said,
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.280]   "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.560]   And Fred, I don't know if you like poetry,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.040]   but I'm gonna end with a poem.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.200]   It's one of my favorites.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.040]   It's written by John Milton who wrote "Paradise Lost."
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.040]   It's called "On His Blindness."
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.720]   He went blind at age 46.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.640]   That's when it finished anyway.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.720]   He couldn't see anything after age 46.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   He lived another 20 years till 1674, totally blind.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:25.160]   And this poem is about his struggle with feeling useless
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.600]   and yet coming to a very crucial insight.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.760]   So, "When I consider how my light is spent
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.640]   ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.760]   and that one talent which is death to hide
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.720]   lodged with me useless,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.800]   though my soul more bent to serve there with my maker
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.000]   and present my true account lest he returning chide.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.080]   Doth God exact day labor light denied, I fondly ask?
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.280]   But patience, to prevent that murmur soon replies,
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   God doth not need either man's work or his own gifts.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.400]   Who best bear his mild yoke, they serve him best.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   His state is kingly, thousands at his bidding speed
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.600]   and post or land and ocean without rest.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.560]   They also serve who only stand and wait."
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.840]   Hmm, profound.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.160]   Yeah, imagine your trade being in writing and reading
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.760]   like Milton and then facing blindness by age 46.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   I mean, talk about a midlife crisis
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.120]   and here he is standing ready to serve God.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   So in this context, I mean, the king and his warriors,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.920]   Milton sees himself as willing to act,
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.520]   but as a soldier, he is often assigned
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.960]   with the duty of watching and waiting.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.880]   Wow, that is worth listening to over and over a few times
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.760]   for it to sink in.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.120]   Thank you, Pastor John, for bringing this poem
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.000]   into the discussion.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.600]   And Fred, thank you for the question.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.360]   I should point out here that Pastor John
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.960]   has a little book on this theme entitled,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.160]   "Rethinking Retirement, Finishing Life
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.120]   for the Glory of Christ."

[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.040]   Well, we're gonna close the week hearing
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.840]   from a female listener who finds herself stuck
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   in a deep season of grief and sorrow that will not pass.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   So how can she honor God inside this unalleviated pain?
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.640]   That's on Friday.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.080]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we'll see you then.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.240]   (upbeat music)
