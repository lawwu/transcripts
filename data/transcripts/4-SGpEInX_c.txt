[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram,
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.920]   his third time on the podcast.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.600]   He's a computer scientist, mathematician,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.640]   theoretical physicist, and the founder of Wolfram Research,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.600]   a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.640]   Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics Project.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840]   This conversation is a wild, technical rollercoaster ride
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.000]   through topics of complexity, mathematics, physics,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.180]   computing, and consciousness.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.600]   I think this is what this podcast is becoming, a wild ride.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.040]   Some episodes are about physics, some about robots,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.400]   some are about war and power,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.480]   some are about the human condition
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.900]   and our search for meaning,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.780]   and some are just what the comedian Tim Dillon calls fun.
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.820]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.680]   To support it, please check out the sponsors
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.920]   in the description.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.700]   And now, here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.740]   Almost 20 years ago, you published "A New Kind of Science,"
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.520]   where you presented a study of complexity
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.500]   and an approach for modeling of complex systems.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500]   So, let us return again to the core idea of complexity.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.560]   What is complexity?
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.840]   - I don't know, I think that's not
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.440]   the most interesting question.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.020]   It's like, you know, if you ask a biologist, what is life?
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.860]   - Yeah.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.600]   - That's not the question they care the most about.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.800]   What I was interested in is how does something
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.240]   that we would usually identify as complexity
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.080]   arise in nature?
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.740]   And I got interested in that question like 50 years ago,
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.140]   which is really embarrassingly a long time ago.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.760]   And, you know, I was, you know,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.240]   how does snowflakes get to have complicated forms?
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.440]   How do galaxies get to have complicated shapes?
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.360]   How does, you know, how do living systems get produced?
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.440]   Things like that.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.040]   And the question is, what's the sort of underlying
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.640]   scientific basis for those kinds of things?
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.840]   And the thing that I was at first very surprised by,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.200]   'cause I've been doing physics and particle physics
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.360]   and fancy mathematical physics and so on.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.280]   And it's like, I know all this fancy stuff.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.360]   I should be able to solve this sort of basic
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.640]   science question.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.440]   And I couldn't, this was like early,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.520]   maybe 1980-ish timeframe.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.120]   And it's like, okay, what can one do to understand
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.480]   the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.880]   'Cause it seems like nature, you know,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.120]   you look around in the natural world,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.480]   it's full of incredibly complicated forms.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.160]   You look at sort of most engineered kinds of things,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.920]   for instance, they tend to be, you know,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.320]   we got sort of circles and lines and things like this.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.760]   The question is, what secret does nature have
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.820]   that lets it make all this complexity
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.120]   that we in doing engineering, for example,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.120]   don't naturally seem to have?
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.480]   And so that was the kind of the thing
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.920]   that I got interested in.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.240]   And then the question was, you know,
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.360]   could I understand that with things
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.600]   like mathematical physics?
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.160]   Well, it didn't work very well.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   So then I got to thinking about, okay,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.840]   is there some other way to try to understand this?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.920]   And then the question was,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.320]   if you're going to look at some system in nature,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.080]   how do you make a model for that system,
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.520]   for what that system does?
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.980]   So, you know, a model is some abstract representation
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.960]   of the system, some formal representation of the system.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.760]   What is the raw material
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.720]   that you can make that model out of?
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.880]   And so what I realized was, well, actually,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.000]   programs are really good source of raw material
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.640]   for making models of things.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.480]   And, you know, in terms of my personal history,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.200]   the, to me, that seemed really obvious.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.480]   And the reason it seemed really obvious
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.960]   is because I just spent several years building
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.360]   this big piece of software that was sort of a predecessor
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.200]   to Mathematica and Morphine Language,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.240]   thing called SMP, Symbolic Manipulation Program,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.760]   which was something that had this idea
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.200]   of starting from just these computational primitives
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.920]   and building up everything one had to build up.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.000]   And so kind of the notion of, well,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.320]   let's just try and make models
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.120]   by starting from computational primitives
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.600]   and seeing what we can build up.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.160]   That seemed like a totally obvious thing to do.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.400]   In retrospect, it might not have been externally
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.680]   quite so obvious, but it was obvious to me at the time,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.040]   given the path that I happened to have been on.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   So, you know, so that got me into this question
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.300]   of let's use programs to model what happens in nature.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.160]   And the question then is, well, what kind of programs?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.200]   And, you know, we're used to programs
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.080]   that you write for some particular purpose
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.320]   and it's a big, long piece of code
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.080]   and it does some specific thing.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.600]   But what I got interested in was, okay,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.480]   if you just go out into the sort of computational universe
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   of possible programs, you say,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.740]   take the simplest program you can imagine, what does it do?
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.880]   And so I started studying these things
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.800]   called cellular automata.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.720]   Actually, I didn't know at first
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.880]   they were called cellular automata,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.140]   but I found that out subsequently.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.960]   But it's just a line of cells, you know,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.440]   each one is black or white,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.400]   and it's just some rule that says the color of the cell
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.720]   is determined by the color that it had on the previous step
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.080]   and its two neighbors on the previous step.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.640]   And I had initially thought that, you know,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.680]   sufficiently simple setup
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.080]   is not gonna do anything interesting.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.500]   It's always gonna be simple, no complexity,
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.560]   simple rule, simple behavior.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.000]   Okay, but then I actually ran the computer experiment,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.080]   which is pretty easy to do.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.260]   I mean, it probably took a few hours originally.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.640]   And the results were not what I'd expected at all.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.560]   Now, needless to say,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   in the way that science actually works,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.240]   the results that I got had a lot of unexpected things
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.840]   which I thought were really interesting,
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.880]   but the really strongest result,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.000]   which was already right there in the printouts I made,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.680]   I didn't really understand for a couple more years.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.560]   So it was not, you know,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.080]   the compressed version of the story is
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.160]   you run the experiment
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.080]   and you immediately see what's going on,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.220]   but I wasn't smart enough to do that, so to speak.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.500]   But the big thing is,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.000]   even with very simple rules of that type,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.640]   sort of the minimal, tiniest program,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.840]   sort of the one line program or something,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.240]   it's possible to get very complicated behavior.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.280]   My favorite example is this thing called rule 30,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.120]   which is a particular cellular automaton rule.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.200]   You just start it off from one black cell
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.980]   and it makes this really complicated pattern.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.680]   And so that, for me, was sort of a critical discovery
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.740]   that then kind of said, playing back onto, you know,
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.960]   how does nature make complexity?
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.480]   I sort of realized that might be how it does it.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.980]   That might be kind of the secret that it's using
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.900]   is that in this kind of computational universe
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.460]   of possible programs,
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.620]   it's actually pretty easy to get programs
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.580]   where even though the program is simple,
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.480]   the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.980]   And that was, so for me,
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.220]   that was the kind of the story of kind of how,
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.260]   that was sort of the indication that one had got an idea
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.880]   of what the sort of secret that nature uses
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.020]   to make complexity
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.640]   and how complexity can be made in other places.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.180]   Now, if you say, what is complexity?
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.860]   You know, it's, complexity is,
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.960]   it's not easy to tell what's going on.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.420]   That's the informal version of what is complexity.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.180]   - But there is something going on.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.000]   - But there's a rule. - But it's not easy
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.100]   to know what. - Right.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.680]   - Well, no, the rules can generate just randomness, right?
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.880]   - Well, that's not obvious.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.960]   In other words-- - That's not obvious,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.440]   that's right. - It's not obvious at all.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.800]   And it wasn't what I expected.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.180]   It's not what people's intuition had been
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.180]   and has been for, you know, for a long time.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.560]   That is, one might think you have a rule,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.020]   you can tell there's a rule behind it.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.340]   I mean, it's just like, you know,
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.220]   the early, you know, robots in science fiction movies,
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.900]   right, you can tell it's a robot
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.860]   'cause it does simple things, right?
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.520]   Turns out that isn't actually the right story,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.360]   but it's not obvious that isn't the right story
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.520]   'cause people assume simple rules, simple behavior.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.880]   And that, the sort of the key discovery
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.340]   about the computational universe is that isn't true.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.980]   And that discovery goes very deep
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.100]   and relates to all kinds of things
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.520]   that I've spent years and years studying.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.920]   But, you know, in the end,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.340]   the sort of the what is complexity is,
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.060]   well, you can't easily tell what it's going to do.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.920]   You could just run the rule and see what happens,
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.300]   but you can't just say, oh, you know, show me the rule.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.420]   Great, now I know what's gonna happen.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.740]   And, you know, the key phenomenon around that
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.740]   is this thing I call computational irreducibility.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.340]   This fact that in something like rule 30,
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.580]   you might say, well, what's it gonna do
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.180]   after a million steps?
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.340]   Well, you can run it for a million steps
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.820]   and just do what it does to find out,
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.740]   but you can't compress that, you can't reduce that
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.140]   and say, I'm gonna be able to jump ahead and say,
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.680]   this is what it's gonna do after a million steps,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.940]   but I don't have to go through anything
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.520]   like that computational effort.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.340]   - By the way, has anybody succeeded at that?
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.460]   Do you had to challenge a competition
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.700]   for predicting the middle column of rule 30?
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.540]   - Indeed.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.380]   - Anybody?
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.820]   - A number of people have sent things in
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.740]   and sort of people are picking away at it,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.820]   but it's hard.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.820]   I mean, I've been actually even proving
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.860]   that the center column of rule 30 doesn't repeat.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.620]   That's something I think might be doable, okay?
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.840]   - Mathematically proving.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.620]   - Yes, and so that's analogous to a similar kind of thing
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.140]   is like the digits of pi,
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.060]   which are also generated in this very deterministic way.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.780]   And so a question is how random are the digits of pi?
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.140]   For example, does every, first of all,
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.780]   do the digits of pi ever repeat?
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.980]   Well, we know they don't.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.840]   This was proved in the 1800s
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.740]   that pi is not a rational number.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.780]   So that means only rational numbers
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.460]   have digit sequences that repeat.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.600]   So we know the digits of pi don't repeat.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.500]   So now the question is, does, you know,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.140]   zero, one, two, three, or whatever,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.220]   do all the digits base 10 or base two,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.480]   or however you work it out,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.720]   do they all occur with equal frequency?
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.200]   Nobody knows.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.100]   That's far away from what can be understood mathematically
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.320]   at this point.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   And that's kind of, but I'm even looking for step one,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.460]   which is prove that the center column doesn't repeat
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.920]   and then prove other things about it,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.620]   like equidistribution of equal numbers of zeros and ones.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.220]   And those are things which I, you know,
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.900]   I kind of set up this little prize thing
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.660]   because I thought those were not too out of range.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.220]   Those are things which are within, you know,
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.020]   a modest amount of time,
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.540]   it's conceivable that those could be done.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.300]   They're not far away from what current mathematics
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.140]   might allow.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.480]   They'll require a bunch of cleverness
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.060]   and hopefully some interesting new ideas
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.500]   that, you know, will be useful other places.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.900]   - But you started in 1980 with this idea
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.220]   before I think you realized, you know,
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.460]   this idea of programs.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.580]   You thought that there might be some kind of
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.780]   thermodynamic like randomness,
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.780]   and then the complexity comes from a clever filter
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.380]   that you kind of, like, I don't know,
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.740]   spaghetti or something.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.180]   You filter the randomness and outcomes complexity,
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.540]   which is an interesting intuition.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.820]   How do we know that's not actually what's happening?
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.060]   So just because you were then able to develop,
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.780]   look, you don't need this like incredible randomness.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.720]   You can just have very simple, predictable,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.380]   initial conditions and predictable rules.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.820]   And then from that emerged complexity.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.820]   Still, there might be some systems
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.660]   where it's filtering randomness in the inputs.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.780]   - Well, the point is, when you have quotes
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.100]   randomness in the input,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.680]   that means there's all kinds of information in the input.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.620]   And in a sense, what you get out
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.100]   will be maybe just something close to what you put in.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.280]   Like people are very, in dynamical systems theory,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.940]   sort of big area of mathematics that developed
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.720]   from the early 1900s and really got big in the 1980s.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.140]   You know, an example of what people study there a lot,
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.180]   and it's popular version is chaos theory.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.900]   And an example of what people study a lot
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.900]   is the shift map, which is basically taking 2X mod one,
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.340]   the fractional part of 2X,
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.260]   which is basically just taking digits in binary
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.760]   and shifting them to the left.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.800]   So at every step, you get to see,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.560]   if you say, how big is this number that I got out?
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.480]   Well, the most important digit in that number
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.720]   is whatever ended up at the left-hand end.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.940]   But now if you start off from an arbitrary random number,
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.740]   which is quotes randomly chosen,
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.520]   so all its digits are random,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.000]   then when you run that sort of chaos theory shift map,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.080]   all that you get out is just whatever you put in.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.220]   You just get to see what you,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.400]   it's not obvious that you would excavate
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.800]   all of those digits.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.440]   And if you're, for example, making a theory,
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.600]   I don't know, fluid mechanics, for example,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.400]   if there was that phenomenon in fluid mechanics,
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.160]   then the equations of fluid mechanics can't be right.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.120]   Because what that would be saying is,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.060]   the equations of that it matters to the fluid,
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.740]   what happens in the fluid at the level of the,
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.020]   you know, millionth digit of the initial conditions,
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.760]   which is far below the point at which you're hitting
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.980]   kind of sizes of molecules and things like that.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.100]   So it's kind of almost explaining,
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.860]   if that phenomenon is an important thing,
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.540]   it's kind of telling you that the, you know,
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.540]   fluid dynamics, which describes fluids as continuous media
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.540]   and so on, isn't really right.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.620]   But so, you know, so this idea that, you know,
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.360]   there's a, it's a tricky thing,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.540]   because as soon as you put randomness in,
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.660]   you have to know, you know, what,
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.160]   how much of what's coming out is what you put in,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.760]   versus how much is actually something
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.800]   that's being generated.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.940]   And what's really nice about these systems
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.360]   where you just have very simple initial conditions,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.800]   and where you get random stuff out,
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.760]   or seemingly random stuff out,
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   is you don't have that issue.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.420]   You don't have to argue about,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.580]   was there something complicated put in?
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.160]   Because it's plainly obvious there wasn't.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.920]   Now, as a practical matter in doing experiments,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.160]   the big thing is, if the thing you see
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.740]   is complex and reproducible,
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.500]   then it didn't come from just filtering some,
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.860]   quotes, "randomness from the outside world."
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.680]   It has to be something that is intrinsically made,
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.080]   because it wouldn't otherwise be, I mean, you know,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.940]   it could be the case that you set things up,
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.540]   and it's always the same each time,
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.120]   and you say, well, it's kind of the same,
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.000]   but it's not random each time,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.400]   because it's kind of the definition of it being random,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.520]   is it was kind of picked at random each time, so to speak.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.360]   - So is it possible to for sure know
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.960]   that our universe does not,
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.360]   at the fundamental level, have randomness?
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.920]   Is it possible to conclusively say,
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.720]   there's no randomness at the bottom?
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.040]   - Well, it's an interesting question.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.980]   I mean, you know, science, natural science,
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.720]   is an inductive business, right?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.240]   You observe a bunch of things, and you say,
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.760]   can we fit these together?
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.100]   What is our hypothesis for what's going on?
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.780]   The thing that I think I can say fairly definitively
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.900]   is at this point, we understand enough
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.240]   about fundamental physics that there is,
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.260]   if there was sort of an extra dice being thrown,
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.540]   it's something that doesn't need to be there.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.460]   We can get what we see without that.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.220]   Now, you know, could you add that in
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.560]   as an extra little featureoid, you know,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.740]   without breaking the universe?
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.260]   Probably, but in fact, almost certainly yes.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.460]   But is it necessary for understanding the universe?
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.420]   No, and I think actually from a more fundamental
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.320]   point of view, it's, I think I might be able to argue.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.380]   So one of the things that I've been interested in,
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.700]   I've been pretty surprised that I've had anything
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.080]   sentient to say about, is the question of,
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.220]   why does the universe exist?
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.120]   I didn't think that was a question that I would,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.540]   you know, I thought that was a far out there
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.580]   metaphysical kind of thing.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.060]   Even the philosophers have stayed away
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.740]   from that question for the most part.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.060]   It's so such a kind of, you know,
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.480]   difficult to address question.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.900]   But I actually think to my great surprise
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.860]   that from our physics project and so on,
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.260]   that it is possible to actually address that question
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.100]   and explain why the universe exists.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.140]   And I kind of have a suspicion, I've not thought it through.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.880]   I kind of have a suspicion that that explanation
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.780]   will eventually show you that in no meaningful sense,
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.180]   can there be randomness underneath the universe?
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.960]   That is that if there is, it's something
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.740]   that is necessarily irrelevant
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.860]   to our perception of the universe.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.020]   That is that it could be there, but it doesn't matter.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.460]   Because in a sense, we've already, you know,
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.940]   whatever it would do, whatever extra thing it would add
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.300]   is not relevant to our perception of what's going on.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.220]   - So why does the universe exist?
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.580]   How does the irrelevance of randomness
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.420]   connect to the big why question of the universe?
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.140]   - So, okay, so I mean, why does the universe exist?
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.140]   Well, let's see.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.700]   - And is this the only universe we got?
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.300]   - It's the only one.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.900]   About that, I'm pretty sure.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.740]   - So you may be, which one,
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.780]   which of these topics is better to enter first?
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.000]   Why does the universe exist?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.660]   And why you think it's the only one that exists?
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.340]   - Well, I think they're very closely related.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.460]   - Okay. - Okay?
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.160]   So I mean, the first thing, let's see.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.740]   I mean, this why does the universe exist question
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.020]   is built on top of all these things
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.300]   that we've been figuring out about fundamental physics.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.220]   'Cause if you wanna know why the universe exists,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.620]   you kind of have to know what the universe is made of.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:02.620]   And I think the, well, let me describe a little bit
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.140]   about the why does the universe exist question.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.620]   So the main issue is,
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.980]   let's say you have a model for the universe.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.780]   And you say, I've got this program or something,
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.920]   and you run it and you make the universe.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.500]   Now you say, well, how do you actually,
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.700]   why is that program actually running?
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.540]   And people say, you've got this program
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.140]   that makes the universe, what computer is it running on?
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:22.980]   Right?
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.980]   What does it mean?
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.580]   What actualizes something?
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.380]   You know, two plus two equals four,
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.260]   but that's different from saying there's two,
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.300]   a pile of two rocks, another pile of two rocks,
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.640]   and somebody moves them together and makes four,
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.660]   so to speak.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.220]   And so what is it that kind of turns it
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.500]   from being just this formal thing
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.060]   to being something that is actualized?
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.900]   Okay, so there we have to start thinking about,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.100]   well, what do we actually know
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.500]   about what's going on in the universe?
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.540]   Well, we are observers of this universe,
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.540]   but confusingly enough, we're part of this universe.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.820]   So in a sense, if we say,
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.420]   what do we know about what's going on in the universe?
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.340]   Well, what we know is what sort of our consciousness records
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.340]   about what's going on in the universe.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.260]   - And consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.240]   so we're in it.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.340]   - Yes, we're in it.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.740]   And maybe I should start off
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.780]   by saying something about the consciousness story,
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.180]   because that's--
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.900]   - Yes, maybe we should begin even before that,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.800]   at the very base layer of the Wolfram Physics Project.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.580]   Maybe you can give a broad overview, once again,
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.380]   really quick about this hypergraph model.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.620]   - Yes. - And also,
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.620]   what is it, a year and a half ago,
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.240]   since you've brought this project to the world,
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.220]   what is the status update?
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.620]   What are all the beautiful ideas you have come across?
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.540]   What are the interesting things you can sort of mention?
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.260]   - I mean, it's a frigging Cambrian explosion.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.500]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.680]   I mean, there are all these things,
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.020]   which I've kind of wondered about for years,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.720]   and suddenly, there's actually a way to think about them.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.820]   And I really did not see,
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.780]   I mean, the real strength of what's happened,
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.460]   I absolutely did not see coming.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.300]   And the real strength of it is,
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.740]   we've got this model for physics,
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.420]   but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.300]   that's a different kind of computation-like model,
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.700]   that I'm kind of calling the sort of
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.140]   multi-computational model.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.800]   And that that kind of model is applicable,
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   not only to physics,
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.200]   but also to lots of other kinds of things.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.700]   And one reason that's extremely powerful
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.820]   is because physics has been very successful.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.780]   So we know a lot, based on what we figured out in physics.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.020]   And if we know that the same model governs physics,
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.620]   and governs, I don't know, economics,
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.100]   linguistics, immunology, whatever,
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.060]   we know that the same kind of model governs those things,
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.740]   we can start using things
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.980]   that we've successfully discovered in physics,
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.740]   and applying those intuitions in all these other areas.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.540]   And that's pretty exciting, and very surprising to me.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.160]   And in fact, it's kind of like,
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.800]   in the original story of, sort of,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.340]   you go and you explain why is there complexity
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.820]   in the natural world,
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.820]   then you realize, well, there's all this complexity,
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.140]   there's all this computational irreducibility,
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.740]   you know, there's a lot we can't know
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.820]   about what's going to happen.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.740]   It's kind of a very confusing thing for people who say,
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.760]   you know, science has nailed everything down,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.600]   we're gonna, you know,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.360]   based on science, we can know everything.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.580]   Well, actually, there's this computational irreducibility
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.820]   thing right in the middle of that,
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.180]   thrown up by science, so to speak.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.020]   And then the question is,
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.220]   well, given computational irreducibility,
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.880]   how can we actually figure out anything
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.060]   about what happens in the world?
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.740]   Why aren't we, why are we able to predict anything?
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.900]   Why are we able to sort of operate in the world?
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.340]   And the answer is that we sort of live
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.380]   in these slices of computational reusability
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.220]   that exist in this kind of ocean
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.220]   of computational irreducibility.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.140]   And it turns out that it seems
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.940]   that it's a very fundamental feature
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.940]   of the kind of model that seems to operate in physics
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.940]   and perhaps in a lot of these other areas,
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.820]   that there are these particular slices
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.580]   of computational reducibility that are relevant to us.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.220]   And those are the things that both allow us
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.740]   to operate in the world
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.460]   and not just have everything be completely unpredictable,
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.040]   but they're also things that potentially give us
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.740]   what amount to sort of physics-like laws
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.120]   in all these other areas.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.580]   So that's been sort of an exciting thing,
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.540]   but I would say that in general for our project,
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.240]   it's been going spectacularly well.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.940]   I mean, you know, it's very, honestly,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.420]   it wasn't something I expected to happen in my lifetime.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.940]   I mean, it's, you know, it's something where it's,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.220]   and in fact, one of the things about it,
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.220]   some of the things that we've discovered
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.140]   are things where I was pretty sure
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.020]   that wasn't how things worked and turns out I'm wrong.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.180]   And, you know, in a major area in meta-mathematics,
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.100]   I'd be realizing that something I've long believed,
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.700]   we can talk about it later,
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.860]   that just really isn't right.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.100]   But I think that the thing that,
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.860]   so what's happened with the physics project,
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.420]   I mean, you know, it's a,
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.940]   it can explain a little bit about how the model works,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.780]   but basically--
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.620]   - We can maybe ask you the following question.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.900]   So it's easy through words
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.780]   to describe how cellular automata works.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.840]   You've explained this.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.400]   And it's the fundamental mechanism
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.260]   by which you, in your book,
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.300]   a new kind of science,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.020]   explored the idea of complexity
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.580]   and how to do science in this world
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.660]   of reducible islands and irreducible,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.380]   generally irreducibility.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.300]   Okay, so how does the model of hypergraphs
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.860]   differ from cellular automata?
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.960]   And how does the idea of multi-computation differ?
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.100]   Like maybe that's a way to describe it.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.900]   - Right, we're, yeah, right.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.260]   This is a, you know, my life is,
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.300]   like all of our lives,
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.180]   something of a story of computational irreducibility.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.580]   And, you know, it's been going for a few years now.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.220]   So it's always a challenge
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.580]   to kind of find these appropriate pockets of reducibility.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.180]   But let me see what I can do.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.260]   So, I mean, first of all,
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.100]   let's talk about physics, first of all.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.540]   And, you know, a key observation,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.860]   the starting point of our physics project
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.140]   is things about what is space?
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.960]   What is the universe made of?
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.980]   And, you know, ever since Euclid,
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.100]   people just sort of say space is just this thing
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.740]   where you can put things at any position you want.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.860]   And they're just points,
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.540]   and they're just geometrical things
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.220]   that you can just arbitrarily put
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.660]   at different coordinate positions.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.100]   Sort of the first thing in our physics project
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.580]   is the idea that space is made of something.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.420]   Just like water is made of molecules,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.260]   space is made of kind of atoms of space.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.940]   And the only thing we can say about these atoms of space
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.260]   is they have some identity.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.220]   It's this atom as opposed to this atom.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.200]   And, you know, you could give them,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.180]   if you were a computer person,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.940]   you'd give them UUIDs or something.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.660]   (Luke laughs)
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.500]   - Yes.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.300]   - And that's all there is to say about them, so to speak.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.140]   And then all we know about these atoms of space
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.020]   is how they relate to each other.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.700]   So we say these three atoms of space
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.160]   are associated with each other in some relation.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.540]   So you can think about that as, you know,
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.220]   what atom of space is friends
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.100]   with what other atom of space?
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.140]   You can build this essentially friend network
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.860]   of the atoms of space.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.540]   And the sort of starting point of our physics project
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.380]   is that's what our universe is.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.420]   It's a giant friend network of the atoms of space.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.140]   And so how can that possibly represent our universe?
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.780]   Well, it's like in something like water,
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.540]   you know, there are molecules bouncing around,
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.500]   but on a large scale, that produces fluid flow
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.900]   and we have fluid vortices
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.560]   and we have all of these phenomena
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.820]   that are sort of the emergent phenomena
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.120]   from that underlying kind of collection of molecules
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.220]   bouncing around.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.300]   And by the way, it's important
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.440]   that that collection of molecules bouncing around
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.860]   have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.100]   That's actually what leads
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.660]   to the second law of thermodynamics among other things.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.300]   And that leads to the sort of randomness
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.860]   of the underlying behavior,
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.520]   which is what gives you something,
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.020]   which on a large scale
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.060]   seems like it's a smooth, continuous type of thing.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:11.060]   And so, okay, so first thing is space is made of something.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.380]   It's made of all these atoms of space
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.260]   connected together in this network.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.700]   And then everything that we experience
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.660]   is sort of features of that structure of space.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.460]   So, you know, when we have an electron or something
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.280]   or a photon, it's some kind of tangle
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.380]   in the structure of space,
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.540]   much like kind of a vortex in a fluid
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.780]   would be just this thing that is, you know,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.300]   it can actually, the vortex can move around,
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.020]   it can involve different molecules in the fluid,
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.900]   but the vortex still stays there.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.060]   - And if you zoom out enough,
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.300]   the vortex looks like an atom itself,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.300]   like a basic element.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.140]   - Yes.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.100]   - So there's the levels of abstraction.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.780]   If you squint and kind of blur things out,
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.460]   it looks like at every level of abstraction,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.820]   you can define what is a basic individual entity.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.780]   - Yes, but, you know, in this model,
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.020]   there's a bottom level.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.860]   - Yeah.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.680]   - You know, there's an elementary length,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.740]   maybe 10 to the minus 100 meters, let's say,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.780]   which is really small, you know,
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.140]   a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.580]   The smallest we've ever been able to sort of see
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.660]   with a particle accelerator
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.780]   is around 10 to the minus 21 meters.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.740]   So, you know, if we don't know precisely
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.860]   what the correct scale is,
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.380]   but it's perhaps over the order of 10 to the minus 100 meters
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.440]   so it's pretty small.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.020]   And, but that's the end, that's what things are made of.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.100]   - What's your intuition
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.180]   where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from?
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.300]   What's your intuition about this scale?
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.220]   - Well, okay, so there's a calculation
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.980]   which I consider to be somewhat rickety, okay?
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.460]   Which has to do with comparing,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.940]   so there are various fundamental constants.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.220]   There's the speed of light,
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.080]   the speed of light, once you know the elementary time,
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.660]   the speed of light tells you the conversion
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.360]   from the elementary time to the elementary length.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.140]   Then there's the question of how do you convert
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.940]   to the elementary energy?
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.700]   And how do you convert to, between other things?
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.220]   And the various constants we know,
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.140]   we know the speed of light,
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.460]   we know the gravitational constant,
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.860]   we know Planck's constant in quantum mechanics,
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.700]   those are the three important ones.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.620]   And we actually know some other things,
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.820]   we know things like the size of the universe,
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.080]   the Hubble constant, things like that.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.860]   And essentially this calculation of the elementary length
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.340]   comes from looking at the sort of combination of those,
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.080]   okay, so the most obvious thing,
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.540]   people have sort of assumed that quantum gravity
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.260]   happens at this thing, the Planck scale,
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.980]   10 to the minus 34 meters,
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.660]   which is the sort of the combination of Planck's constant
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.700]   and the gravitational constant, the speed of light,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.480]   that gives you that kind of length.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.520]   Turns out in our model, there is an additional parameter,
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.260]   which is essentially the number of simultaneous threads
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.140]   of execution of the universe,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.640]   which is essentially the number of sort of
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.220]   independent quantum processes that are going on.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.420]   And that number, let's see if I remember that number,
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.660]   that number is 10 to the 170, I think,
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.900]   and so it's a big number,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.960]   but that number then connects,
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.180]   sort of modifies what you might think
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.360]   from all these Planck units
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.540]   to give you the things we're giving.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.060]   And there's been sort of a mystery actually,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.720]   and there's a more technical physics thing,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.740]   that the Planck mass, the Planck energy,
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.100]   Planck energy is actually surprisingly big.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.540]   The Planck length is tiny, 10 to the minus 34 meters,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.500]   the Planck time, 10 to the minus 43 meters, I think,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.420]   that seconds, I think,
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.180]   but the Planck energy is like the energy
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.940]   of a lightning strike, okay, which is pretty weird.
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.760]   In our models, the actual elementary energy
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.940]   is that divided by the number of sort of
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.880]   simultaneous quantum threads,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.860]   and it ends up being really small too.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.680]   And that sort of explains that mystery
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.220]   that's been around for a while
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.000]   about how Planck units work.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.540]   But whether that precise estimate is right,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.380]   we don't know yet.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.780]   I mean, that's one of the things
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.660]   that's sort of been a thing we've been pretty interested in
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.740]   is how do you see through,
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.520]   how do you make a gravitational microscope
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.860]   that can kind of see through to the atoms of space?
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.580]   You know, how do you get, in fluid flow, for example,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.420]   if you go to hypersonic flow or something,
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.260]   you know, you've got a Mark 20,
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.980]   you know, space plane or something,
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.860]   it really matters that there are individual molecules
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.800]   hitting the space plane, not a continuous fluid.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.420]   The question is, what is the analogous kind of,
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.620]   what is the analog of hypersonic flow
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.780]   for things about the structure of space-time?
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.260]   And it looks like a rapidly rotating black hole, right,
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.840]   at the sort of critical rotation rate,
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.820]   it looks as if that's a case where essentially
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.900]   the structure of space-time is just about to fall apart.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.780]   And you may be able to kind of see the evidence
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.080]   of sort of discrete elements, you know,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.220]   you may be able to kind of see there
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.920]   the sort of gravitational microscope
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.840]   of actually seeing these discrete elements of space.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.380]   And there may be some effect in, for example,
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.620]   gravitational waves produced by rapidly rotating black hole
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.300]   that in which one could actually see some phenomenon
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.860]   where one can say, yes,
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.340]   these don't come out the way one would expect
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.900]   based on having a continuous structure of space-time,
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.140]   that is it something where you can kind of see through
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.020]   to the discrete structure?
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.980]   We don't know that yet.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.740]   - So can you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.740]   how a microscope that can see to 10 to the minus 100,
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.980]   how rotating black holes and presumably
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.980]   the detailed accurate detection of gravitational waves
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.900]   from such black holes can reveal the discreteness of space?
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.980]   - Okay, first thing is what is a black hole?
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.140]   Actually, we need to go a little bit further
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.700]   in the story of what space-time is
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.780]   'cause I explained a little bit about what space is,
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.700]   but I didn't talk about what time is.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.940]   And that's sort of important
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.580]   in understanding space-time, so to speak.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.620]   - And your sense is both space and time
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.020]   in the story are discrete.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.860]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.740]   But it's a complicated story.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.540]   And needless to say.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.260]   - Well, it's simple at the bottom.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.220]   - It's very simple at the bottom.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.860]   It's very, in the end, it's simple but deeply abstract.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:18.460]   And something that is simple in conception,
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.060]   but kind of wrapping one's head around what's going on
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.280]   is pretty hard.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.460]   But so first of all, we have this,
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.940]   so I've described these kind of atoms of space
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.180]   and their connections.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.660]   You can think about these things as a hypergraph,
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.140]   a graph is just, you connect nodes to nodes,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.980]   but a hypergraph, you can have sort of not just friends,
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.180]   individual friends to friends,
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.580]   but you can have these triplets of friends or whatever else.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.980]   And so we're just saying,
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.940]   and that's just the relations between atoms of space
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.940]   are the hyper edges of the hypergraph.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.000]   And so we got some big collection of these atoms of space,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.820]   maybe 10 to the 400 or something in our universe.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.180]   And that's the structure of space.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.740]   That's an every feature of what we experience in the world
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.100]   is a feature of that hypergraph, that spatial hypergraph.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.980]   So then the question is,
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.020]   well, what does that spatial hypergraph do?
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.780]   Well, the idea is that there are rules
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.540]   that update that spatial hypergraph.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.940]   And in a cellular automaton,
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.780]   you've just got this line of cells
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.460]   and you just say at every step, at every time step,
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.220]   you've got fixed time steps, fixed array of cells.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.940]   At every step, every cell gets updated
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.500]   according to a certain rule.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.360]   And that's kind of the, that's the way it works.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.780]   Now in this hypergraph,
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.660]   it's sort of vaguely the same kind of thing.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.140]   We say, every time you see a little piece of hypergraph
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.060]   that looks like this, update it to one that looks like this.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.460]   So it's just keep rewriting this hypergraph.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.320]   Every time you see something that looks like that,
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.020]   anywhere in the universe, it gets rewritten.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.880]   Now, one thing that's tricky about that,
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.700]   which we'll come to is this multi-computational idea,
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.220]   which has to do with, you're not saying
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.220]   in some kind of lockstep way,
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.380]   do this one, then this one, then this one.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.760]   It's just whenever you see one you can do,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.260]   you can go ahead and do it.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.020]   And that leads one not to have a single thread of time
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.260]   in the universe.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.760]   Because if you knew which one to do,
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.140]   you just say, okay, we do this one,
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.860]   then we do this one, then we do this one.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.260]   But if you say, just do whichever one you feel like,
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.180]   you end up with these multiple threads of time,
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.180]   these kind of multiple histories of the universe,
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.980]   depending on which order you happen to do
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.300]   the things you could do in.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.900]   - So it's fundamentally asynchronous and parallel.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.100]   - Yes, yes.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.520]   - Which is very uncomfortable for the human brain
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.740]   that seeks for things to be sequential and synchronous.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.500]   - Right, well, I think that this is part
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.620]   of the story of consciousness,
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.620]   is I think the key aspect of consciousness
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.620]   that is important for parsing the universe
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.380]   is this point that we have a single thread of experience.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.420]   We have a memory of what happened in the past,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.160]   we can say something, predict something about the future,
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.500]   but there's a single thread of experience.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.300]   And it's not obvious it should work that way.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.500]   I mean, we've got 100 billion neurons in our brains
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.660]   and they're all firing at all kinds of different ways,
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:09.140]   but yet our experience is that there is the single thread
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.740]   of time that goes along.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.380]   And I think that one of the things I've kind of realized
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.440]   with a lot more clarity in the last year
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.820]   is the fact that we conclude that the universe
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.940]   has the laws it has as a consequence of the fact
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.500]   that we have consciousness the way we have consciousness.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.100]   And so the fact, so I mean, just to go on
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.180]   with kind of the basic setup,
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.500]   it's so we've got this spatial hypergraph,
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.500]   it's got all these atoms of space,
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.220]   they're getting these little clumps of atoms of space
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.980]   are getting turned into other clumps of atoms of space,
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.620]   and that's happening everywhere in the universe all the time.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.060]   And so one thing that's a little bit weird
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.620]   is there's nothing permanent in the universe.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.260]   The universe is getting rewritten everywhere all the time.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.860]   And if it wasn't getting rewritten,
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.780]   space wouldn't be knitted together.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.540]   That is space would just fall apart.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.740]   There wouldn't be any way in which we could say
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.380]   this part of space is next to this part of space.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.720]   You know, one of the things that I was,
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.700]   people were confused about back in antiquity,
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.500]   the ancient Greek philosophers and so on,
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.660]   is how does motion work?
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.120]   You know, how can it be the case that you can take a thing
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.500]   that we can walk around and it's still us
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.620]   when we walked a foot forward, so to speak.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.380]   And in a sense with our models, that's again a question
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.800]   because it's a different set of atoms of space.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.180]   When I move my hand,
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.220]   it's moving into a different set of atoms of space.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.660]   It's having to be recreated.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.180]   It's not the thing itself is not there.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.020]   It's being continuously recreated all the time.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.020]   Now it's a little bit like waves in an ocean,
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.740]   you know, vortices in a fluid,
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.060]   which again, the actual molecules that exist in those
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.380]   are not what define the identity of the thing.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.980]   But it's a little bit, you know,
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.460]   this idea that there can be pure motion,
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.460]   that it is even possible for an object
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.940]   to just move around in the universe and not change.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.940]   It's not self-evident that such a thing should be possible.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.700]   And that is part of our perception of the universe
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.980]   is that we parse those aspects of the universe
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.220]   where things like pure motion are possible.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.500]   Now, pure motion, even in general relativity,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.620]   the theory of gravity,
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.820]   pure motion is a little bit of a complicated thing.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.620]   I mean, if you imagine your average, you know,
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.900]   teacup or something approaching a black hole,
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.180]   it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.700]   And to say, you know, is it really pure motion?
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.780]   Is it that same teacup that's the same shape?
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.020]   Well, it's a bit of a complicated story.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.820]   And this is a more extreme version of that.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.980]   So anyway, the thing that's happening is we've got space,
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.100]   we've got this notion of time.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.100]   So time is this kind of this rewriting of the hypergraph.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.780]   And one of the things that's important about that,
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.140]   time is this sort of computational irreducible process.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.300]   There's something, you know, time is not something where,
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.180]   in kind of the mathematical view of time,
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.980]   tends to be time is just a coordinate.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.620]   We can, you know, slide a slider, turn a knob,
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.740]   and we'll change the time that we've got in this equation.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.020]   But in this picture of time, that's not how it works at all.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.620]   Time is this inexorable, irreducible
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.740]   kind of set of computations that go on,
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.860]   that go from where we are now to the future.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.340]   But so the thing, and one of the things that is, again,
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.460]   something one sort of has to break out of
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.380]   is your average trained physicist like me says,
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.180]   you know, space and time are the same kind of thing.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.380]   They're related by, you know, the Poincaré group
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.820]   and Lorentz transformations and relativity
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.300]   and all these kinds of things.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.180]   And, you know, space and time, you know,
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.940]   there are all these kind of sort of folk stories
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.620]   you can tell about why space and time
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.100]   are the same kind of thing.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.500]   In this model, they're fundamentally
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.940]   not the same kind of thing.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.740]   Space is this kind of sort of connections
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.420]   between these atoms of space.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.620]   Time is this computational process.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.820]   So the thing that the first sort of surprising thing
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.460]   is, well, it turns out you get relativity anyway.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.900]   And the reason that happens,
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.820]   there are a few bits and pieces here,
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.980]   which one has to understand,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.700]   but the fundamental point is,
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.460]   if you are an observer embedded in the system
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.580]   that are part of this whole story
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.580]   of things getting updated in this way and that,
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.980]   there's sort of a limit to what you can tell
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.420]   about what's going on.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.340]   And really in the end, the only thing you can tell
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.020]   is what are the causal relationships between events.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.740]   So an event in this sort of,
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.060]   an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.100]   got rewritten.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.780]   And that means a few hyper edges of the hypergraph
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.860]   were consumed by the event
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   and you produce some other hyper edges.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.780]   And that's an elementary event.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.140]   And so then the question is what we can tell
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.300]   is kind of what the network of causal relationships
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.300]   between elementary events is.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.580]   That's the ultimate thing, the causal graph of the universe.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.500]   And it turns out that,
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.220]   well, there's this property of causal invariance
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.580]   that is true of a bunch of these models.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.420]   And I think is inevitably true for a variety of reasons
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.580]   that makes it be the case that it doesn't matter
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.980]   kind of if you are sort of saying,
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.300]   well, I've got this hypergraph
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.740]   and I can rewrite this piece here and this piece here
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.540]   and I do them all in different orders.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.100]   When you construct the causal graph
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.140]   for each of those orders that you choose to do things in,
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.420]   you'll end up with the same causal graph.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.460]   And so that's essentially why,
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.020]   well, that's in the end why relativity works.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.900]   It's why our perception of space and time
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.940]   is as having this kind of connection
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.060]   that relativity says they should have.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.940]   And that's kind of how that works.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.580]   - I think I'm missing a little piece.
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.020]   If we can go there again,
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.100]   you said the fact that the observer is embedded
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.300]   in this hypergraph, what's missing?
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.540]   What is the observer not able to state
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.780]   about this universe of space and time?
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.460]   - So if you look from the outside,
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:59.460]   you can say, oh, I see this particular place was updated
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:04.100]   and then this one was updated
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.100]   and I'm seeing which order things were updated in.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.940]   But the observer embedded in the universe
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.860]   doesn't know which order things were updated in
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.020]   because until they've been updated,
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.900]   they have no idea what else happened.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.380]   So the only thing they know
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.660]   is the set of causal relationships.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.340]   Let me give an extreme example.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.060]   Let's imagine that the universe is a Turing machine.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.380]   Turing machines have just this one update head,
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.700]   which does something
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.420]   and otherwise the Turing machine just does nothing.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.620]   And the Turing machine works by having this head
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.260]   move around and do its updating,
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.260]   just where the head happens to be.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.820]   The question is, could the universe be a Turing machine?
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.300]   Could the universe just have a single updating head
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.220]   that's just zipping around all over the place?
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.300]   You say, that's crazy because I'm talking to you,
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.460]   you seem to be updating, I'm updating, et cetera.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.460]   But the thing is, there's no way to know that
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.780]   because if there was just this head moving around,
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.820]   it's like, okay, it updates me,
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.100]   but you're completely frozen at that point.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.380]   Until the head has come over and updated you,
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.420]   you have no idea what happened to me.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.700]   And so if you sort of unravel that argument,
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.380]   you realize the only thing we actually can tell
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.540]   is what the network of causal relationships
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.460]   between the things that happened were.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.820]   We don't get to know from some sort of outside
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.940]   sort of God's eye view of the thing.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.580]   We don't get to know what sort of
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.660]   from the outside what happened.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.580]   We only get to know sort of what the set of relationships
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.780]   between the things that happened actually were.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.020]   - Yeah, but if I somehow record like a trace
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.020]   of this, I guess would be called multi-computation,
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.740]   can't I then look back in the-
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.820]   - Where do you record the trace?
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.020]   - Some, you place throughout the universe,
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.580]   like throughout like a log that records
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.060]   in my own pocket in this hypergraph,
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:57.060]   can't I like realizing that I'm getting an outdated picture,
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.700]   can't I record-
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.540]   - See, the problem is,
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.100]   and this is where things start getting very entangled
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.220]   in terms of what one understands.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.460]   The problem is that any such recording device
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.820]   is itself part of the universe.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.980]   So you don't get to say, you never get to say,
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.660]   let's go outside the universe and go do this.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.740]   And that's why, I mean, lots of the features of this model
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.740]   and the way things work end up being a result of that.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.940]   - So, but what, I guess from on a human level,
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.100]   what is the cost you're paying?
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.180]   What are you missing from not getting
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.300]   an updated picture all the time?
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.020]   Okay, I understand what you're just saying.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.860]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.700]   - But like what, like how does consciousness
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.020]   emerge from that?
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.420]   Like how, like what are the limitations of that observer?
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.220]   I understand you're getting a delayed picture.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.540]   - Well, there's a, okay,
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.540]   so there's a bunch of limitations of the observer, I think.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.620]   Maybe just explain something about quantum mechanics,
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.860]   'cause that maybe is an extreme version
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.060]   of some of these issues,
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.020]   which helps to kind of motivate
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.740]   why one should sort of think things through
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.220]   a little bit more carefully.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.340]   So one feature of this, okay,
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.260]   so in standard physics, like high school physics,
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.020]   you learn the equations of motion for a ball.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:16.940]   And it says, you throw the ball this angle, this velocity,
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.140]   things will move in this way,
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.380]   and there's a definite answer, right?
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.860]   The story, the key story of quantum mechanics
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.580]   is there aren't definite answers to where does the ball go?
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.140]   There's kind of this whole sort of bundle of possible paths.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.180]   And all we say we know from quantum mechanics
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.740]   is certain probabilities for where the ball will end up.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.420]   Okay, so that's kind of the core idea of quantum mechanics.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.260]   So in our models, you, quantum mechanics
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.500]   is not some kind of plugin add-on type thing.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.660]   You absolutely cannot get away from quantum mechanics,
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.580]   because as you think about updating this hypergraph,
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.900]   there isn't just one sequence of things,
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.980]   one definite sequence of things that can happen.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.300]   There are all these different possible update sequences
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.260]   that can occur.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.500]   You could do this piece of the hypergraph now,
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.420]   and then this one later, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.540]   All those different paths of history
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.460]   correspond to these quantum paths in quantum mechanics,
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.860]   these different possible quantum histories.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.860]   And one of the things that's kind of surprising about it
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.500]   is they branch, you know,
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.740]   there can be a certain state of the universe,
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.020]   and it could do this, or it could do that,
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.540]   but they can also merge.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.020]   There can be two states of the universe,
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.100]   which their next state,
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.980]   the next state they produce is the same for both of them.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.060]   And that process of branching and merging
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:30.900]   is kind of critical,
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.220]   and the idea that they can be merging is critical,
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.140]   and somewhat non-trivial for these hypergraphs,
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.740]   because there's a whole graph isomorphism story,
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.300]   and there's a whole very elaborate set of mathematics.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.180]   - And that's where the causal invariance comes in?
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.700]   - Yes, among other things, right, yes.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.700]   But so then what happens is that what one's seeing,
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.900]   okay, so we've got this thing,
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.180]   it's branching, it's merging, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.540]   Okay, so now the question is, how do we perceive that?
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.820]   Why don't we notice that the universe
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.420]   is branching and merging?
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.500]   Why is it the case that we just think
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.360]   a definite set of things happen?
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.660]   Well, the answer is we are embedded in that universe,
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.580]   and our brains are branching and merging too.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.300]   And so what quantum mechanics becomes a story of
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.460]   is how does a branching brain perceive a branching universe?
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.820]   And the key thing is, as soon as you say,
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.360]   "I think definite things happen in the universe,"
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.820]   that means you are essentially conflating
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.700]   lots of different parts of history.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.540]   You're saying, "Actually, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.040]   "because I'm convinced that definite things happen
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.040]   "in the universe, all these parts of history
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.380]   "must be equivalent."
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.940]   Now, it's not obvious that that would be
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.420]   a consistent thing to do.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.980]   It might be you say, "All these parts of history
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.320]   "are equivalent, but by golly, moments later,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.140]   "that would be a completely inconsistent point of view.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.500]   "Everything would have gone to hell in different ways."
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.700]   The fact that that doesn't happen is,
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.260]   well, that's a consequence of this causal invariance thing,
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.340]   but that's, and the fact that that does happen a little bit
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.700]   is what causes little quantum effects.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.220]   And that, if that didn't happen at all,
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.860]   there wouldn't be anything that sort of
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.460]   is like quantum mechanics.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.300]   It would be, quantum mechanics is kind of like in this,
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.840]   in this kind of this bundle of paths,
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.100]   it's a little bit like what happens
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.700]   in statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, whatever,
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.380]   that most of the time, you just see this continuous fluid.
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.540]   You just see the world just progressing
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.620]   in this kind of way that's like this continuous fluid.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.560]   But every so often, if you look at the exact right
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.500]   experiment, you can start seeing,
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.360]   well, actually, it's made of these molecules
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.700]   where they might go that way or they might go this way,
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.600]   and that's kind of quantum effects.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.980]   And so, that's, so this kind of idea of
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.060]   where we're sort of embedded in the universe,
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.700]   this branching brain is perceiving this branching universe,
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.420]   and that ends up being sort of a story of quantum mechanics.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.780]   That's part of the whole picture of what's going on.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.180]   But I think, I mean, to come back to sort of
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.020]   where does conscious, what is the story of consciousness?
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.260]   So, in the universe, we've got, you know,
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.360]   whatever it is, 10 to the 400 atoms of space,
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.420]   they're all doing these complicated things.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.500]   It's all a big, complicated, irreducible computation.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.800]   The question is, what do we perceive from all of that?
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   And the answer is that we are parsing the universe
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.460]   in a particular way.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.700]   Let me again go back to the gas molecules analogy.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.200]   You know, in the gas in this room,
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.400]   there are molecules bouncing around
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.440]   in all kinds of complicated patterns, but we don't care.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.120]   All we notice is there's, you know,
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   the gas laws are satisfied,
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.080]   maybe there's some fluid dynamics.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.500]   These are kind of features of that assembly of molecules
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.640]   that we notice, and there are lots of details
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.680]   we don't notice.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.840]   - When you say we, do you mean the tools of physics,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.880]   or do you mean literally the human brain
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.720]   and its perception system?
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.440]   - Well, okay, so the human brain is where it starts,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.760]   but we've built a bunch of instruments
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.520]   to do a bit better than the human brain,
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.800]   but they still have many of the same kinds of ideas.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.420]   You know, they're cameras, and they're pressure sensors,
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.060]   and they're these kinds of things.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.200]   They're not, you know, at this point,
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.760]   we don't know how to make fundamentally, qualitatively
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.440]   different sensory devices.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.640]   - Right, so it's always just an extension
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.720]   of the conscious experience.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.640]   - Or our sensory experience.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.440]   - Sensory experience, but sensory experience
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   is somehow intricately tied to consciousness.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.240]   - Right, well, so one question is,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.800]   when we are looking at all these molecules in the gas,
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.480]   and there might be 10th to 20th molecules
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.780]   in some little box or something,
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:32.160]   it's like, what do we notice about those molecules?
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.760]   So one thing that we can say is,
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.640]   we don't notice that much.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.980]   We are, you know, we are computationally bounded observers.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.520]   We can't go in and say, okay,
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.360]   I'm the 10th to 20th molecules,
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.200]   and I know that I can sort of decrypt their motions,
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.840]   and I can figure out this and that.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.960]   It's like, I'm just going to say,
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   what's the average density of molecules?
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.360]   And so one key feature of us
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.520]   is that we are computationally bounded,
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.080]   and that when you are looking at a universe,
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.920]   which is full of computation,
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.200]   and doing huge amounts of computation,
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.480]   but we are computationally bounded,
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.400]   there's only certain things about that universe
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.920]   that we're going to be sensitive to.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.220]   We're not going to be figuring out
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.200]   what all the atoms of space are doing,
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.960]   because we're just computationally bounded observers,
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   and we are only sampling these small set of features.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.800]   So I think the two defining features of consciousness,
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   and I would say that the sort of the preamble to this is,
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.760]   for years, as I've talked about sort of computation
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.480]   and fundamental features of physics and science,
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.040]   people ask me, so what about consciousness?
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.680]   And I, for years, I've said,
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.800]   I have nothing to say about consciousness.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.080]   And I've kind of told this story,
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.400]   you talk about intelligence, you talk about life.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.520]   These are both features where you say,
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.200]   what's the abstract definition of life?
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.760]   We don't really know the abstract definition.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.440]   We know the one for life on Earth,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.400]   it's got RNA, it's got cell membranes,
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.080]   it's got all this kind of stuff.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.200]   Similarly for intelligence,
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.760]   we know the human definition of intelligence,
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.640]   but what is intelligence abstractly?
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.840]   We don't really know.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.400]   And so what I've long believed is that
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.720]   sort of the abstract definition of intelligence
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.280]   is just computational sophistication.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.200]   That is, that as soon as you can be
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.940]   computationally sophisticated,
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.400]   that's kind of the abstract version,
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.840]   the generalized version of intelligence.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.040]   So then the question is, what about consciousness?
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.440]   And what I sort of realized is that consciousness
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.520]   is actually a step down from intelligence.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.880]   That is, that you might think,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.320]   oh, consciousness is the top of the pile,
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.740]   but actually I don't think it is.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.240]   I think that there's this notion
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.960]   of kind of computational sophistication,
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.440]   which is the generalized intelligence,
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.840]   but consciousness has two limitations, I think.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.160]   One of them is computational boundedness.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.020]   That is, that we're only perceiving
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.680]   a sort of computationally bounded view of the universe.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.560]   And the other is this idea of a single thread of time.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.240]   That is, that we, and in fact, we know,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   neurophysiologically, our brains go to some trouble
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.480]   to give us this one thread of attention, so to speak.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.720]   And it isn't the case that in all the neurons in our brains,
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   that at least in our conscious,
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.800]   note the correspondence of language,
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.680]   in our conscious experience,
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.660]   we just have this single thread of attention,
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.120]   single thread of perception.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.540]   And maybe there's something unconscious
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.840]   that's bubbling around that's the kind of
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.600]   almost the quantum version of what's happening
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.760]   in our brain, so to speak.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.080]   We've got the classical flow
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.200]   of what we are mostly thinking about, so to speak.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.960]   But there's this kind of bubbling around of other paths
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.280]   that is all those other neurons that didn't make it
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.780]   to be part of our sort of conscious stream of experience.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.940]   - So in that sense, intelligence
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.280]   as computational sophistication is much broader
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   than the computational constraints
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.760]   which consciousness operates under,
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.520]   and also the sequential thing.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.120]   - Yes, right. - Like the notion of time.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:51:59.960]   That's kind of interesting,
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.280]   but then the follow-up question is like,
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.200]   okay, starting to get a sense of what is intelligence,
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.240]   and how does that connect to our human brain?
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   'Cause you're saying intelligence is almost like a fabric,
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.000]   like what, we like plug into it or something?
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.320]   Like our consciousness plugs into it?
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.060]   - Yeah, I mean, the intelligence, I think, the core,
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.540]   I mean, intelligence at some level is just a word,
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:28.640]   but we are asking what is the notion of intelligence
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.920]   as we generalize it beyond the bounds of humans,
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.080]   beyond the bounds of even the AIs
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:38.000]   that we humans have built and so on, what is intelligence?
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.960]   Is the weather, people say the weather
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.920]   has a mind of its own, what does that mean?
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.920]   Can the weather be intelligent?
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.000]   - Yeah, what does agency have to do with intelligence here?
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.440]   So is intelligence just like your conception of computation?
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.260]   Is just intelligence, is the capacity
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.980]   to perform computation in a sea of?
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.820]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.900]   I mean, I think that's right,
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.900]   and I think that this question of is it for a purpose,
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.220]   that quickly degenerates into a horrible philosophical mess
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.540]   because whenever you say,
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.900]   did the weather do that for a purpose?
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:13.860]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.260]   Well, yes, it did, it was trying to move a bunch of hot air
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.580]   from the equator to the poles or something,
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.820]   that's its purpose.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:23.700]   But why, 'cause I seem to be equally as dumb today
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.620]   as I was yesterday, so there's some persistence,
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.840]   like a consistency over time
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.540]   that the intelligence I plugged into.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.620]   So it seems like there's a hard constraint
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.620]   between the amount of computation
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.980]   I can perform in my consciousness.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.380]   Like they seem to be really closely connected somehow.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.740]   - Well, I think the point is that the thing
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.840]   that gives you kind of the ability
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:52.840]   to have kind of conscious intelligence,
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.660]   you can have kind of this, okay,
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.180]   so one thing is we don't know intelligences
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.900]   other than the ones that are very much like us, right?
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.020]   And the ones that are very much like us,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.900]   I think have this feature of single thread of time,
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.400]   bounded, computationally bounded.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.460]   Now, that, but you also need computational sophistication.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.020]   Having a single thread of time
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.720]   and being computationally bounded,
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.920]   you could just be a clock going tick-tock, you know,
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.900]   that would satisfy those conditions.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:26.900]   But the fact that we have this sort of irreducible,
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.040]   you know, computational ability,
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.340]   that's an important feature.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.540]   That's the sort of the bedrock
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.860]   on which we can construct the things we construct.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:40.500]   Now, the fact that we have this experience of the world
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.960]   that has a single thread of time
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.680]   and computational boundedness,
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.020]   the thing that I sort of realized is
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.620]   it's that that causes us to deduce
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.060]   from this irreducible mess of what's going on
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.600]   in the physical world,
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.820]   the laws of physics that we think exist.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.180]   So in other words, if we say,
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:02.500]   why do we believe that there is, you know,
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.060]   continuous space, let's say,
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.440]   why do we believe that gravity works the way it does?
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.120]   Well, in principle,
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.740]   we could be kind of parsing details of the universe
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.740]   that were, you know, that,
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.300]   okay, the analogy is, again,
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.640]   with the statistical mechanics and molecules in a box,
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.500]   we could be sensitive to every little detail
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.020]   of the swirling around of those molecules.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:30.180]   And we could say, what really matters is the,
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.740]   you know, the wiggle effect.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.020]   - Yes. - That is, you know,
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.260]   that is something that we humans just never noticed
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.420]   because it's some weird thing that happens
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.400]   when there are 15 collisions of air molecules
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.860]   and this happens and that happens.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.260]   - We just see the pure motion of a ball moving about.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.180]   - Right. - Why do we see that?
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.780]   - Right, and the point is that what seems to be the case
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.700]   is that the things that,
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.860]   if we say, given this sort of hypergraph that's updating
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.700]   and all the details about all the sort of,
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.300]   sort of atoms of space and what they do,
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.180]   and we say, how do we slice that
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.200]   to what we can be sensitive to?
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.380]   What seems to be the case is that as soon as we assume,
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.540]   you know, computational boundedness,
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:13.100]   single thread of time, that leads us to general relativity.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.460]   In other words, we can't avoid that.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:18.060]   That's the way that we will parse the universe.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:20.700]   Given those constraints, we parse the universe
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.220]   according to those particular,
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:27.860]   in such a way that we say the aggregate reducible,
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.620]   sort of pocket of computational reducibility
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.380]   that we slice out of this kind of whole
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:37.580]   computationally irreducible ocean of behavior
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.900]   is just this one that corresponds to general relativity.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.860]   - Yeah, but we don't perceive general relativity.
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:45.180]   - Well, we do if we do fancy experiments.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.020]   - So you're saying, so perceive really does mean the full.
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.060]   - We drop something.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.700]   That's a great example of general relativity in action.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.740]   The gravity force. - No, but like,
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.380]   what's the difference in that and Newtonian mechanics?
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.580]   I mean, what? - Oh, it doesn't,
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.660]   this is, when I say general relativity,
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.140]   that's just the-- - You mean gravity.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.940]   - The Uber theory, so to speak.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.340]   I mean, Newtonian gravity is just the approximation
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.940]   that we can make, you know,
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.620]   on the earth and things like that.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:11.680]   So this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.020]   is one that is a consequence of, you know,
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.540]   we would perceive something very different from gravity.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:22.100]   So the way to understand that is when we think about,
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:26.300]   okay, so we make up reference frames
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.420]   with which we parse what's happening in space and time.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.660]   So in other words, one of the things that we do
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:36.880]   is we say as time progresses,
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.300]   everywhere in space, something happens at a particular time
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.900]   and then we go to the next time
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.980]   and we say this is what space is like at the next time,
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.140]   this is what space is like at the next time.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:51.380]   That's, it's, the reason we are used to doing that
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:53.800]   is because, you know, when we look around,
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.460]   we might see, you know, 10, 100 meters away.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.900]   The time it takes light to travel that distance
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.000]   is really short compared to the time it takes our brains
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.180]   to know what happened.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.340]   So as far as our brains are concerned,
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.160]   we are parsing the universe in this,
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.560]   there is a moment in time, it's all of space.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.560]   There's a moment in time, it's all of space.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.140]   You know, if we were the size of planets or something,
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.340]   we would have a different perception
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.180]   'cause the speed of light
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.760]   would be much more important to us.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.680]   We wouldn't have this perception
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.000]   that things happen progressively in time,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.680]   everywhere in space.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.160]   And so that's an important kind of constraint.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.840]   And the reason that we kind of parse the universe
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.600]   in the way that causes us to say gravity works
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.960]   the way it does is because we're doing things
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.040]   like deciding that we can say the universe exists,
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.560]   space has a definite structure.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.800]   There is a moment in time,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.520]   space has this definite structure.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.880]   We move to the next moment in time,
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.240]   space has another structure.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.620]   That kind of setup is what lets us kind of deduce,
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:57.740]   kind of parse the universe in such a way that we say
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.240]   gravity works the way it does.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.400]   - So that kind of reference frame,
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.000]   is that the illusion of that,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.740]   is that you're saying that's somehow useful
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.720]   for consciousness?
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.560]   - That's what consciousness does.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.620]   Because in a sense, what consciousness is doing is,
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:19.840]   it's insisting that the universe is kind of sequentialized.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.580]   And it is not allowing the possibility that,
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.680]   oh, there are these multiple threads of time
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.320]   and they're all flowing differently.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.560]   It's like saying, no, everything is happening
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.600]   in this one thread of experience that we have.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.280]   - And that illusion of that one thread of experience
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.440]   cannot happen at the planetary scale.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.360]   So are you saying typical human,
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.960]   are you saying we are at a human level is special
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.440]   here for consciousness?
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.560]   - Well, for our kind of consciousness,
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:51.360]   if we existed at a scale close to the elementary length,
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.720]   for example, then our perception of the universe
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.160]   will be absurdly different.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.520]   - Okay, so, but this makes consciousness seem like
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.680]   a weird side effect to this particular scale.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.880]   And so who cares?
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.760]   I mean, so consciousness is not that special.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.200]   - I think, look, I think that a very interesting question is
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.220]   which I've certainly thought a little bit about,
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.820]   is what can you imagine?
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.320]   What is the sort of factoring of something,
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.000]   what are some other possible ways
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   you could exist, so to speak?
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.080]   And if you were a photon, if you were sort of,
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:27.880]   some kind of thing that was some kind of intelligence
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.600]   represented in terms of photons.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.720]   For example, the photons we receive
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.400]   in the cosmic microwave background,
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   those photons, as far as they're concerned,
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.760]   the universe just started.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.520]   They were emitted 100,000 years
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.600]   after the beginning of the universe.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.280]   They've been traveling at the speed of light.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.760]   Time stayed still for them, and then they just arrived
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.140]   and we just detected them.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.960]   So for them, the universe just started.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.240]   And that's a different perception of,
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.320]   that has implications for a very different
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.160]   perception of time.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.920]   - They don't have that single thread
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.040]   that seems to be really important
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.000]   for being able to tell a heck of a good story.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.240]   So we humans-- - Yes.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.160]   - Tell a story. - We can tell a story.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.000]   Right, we can tell a story.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.320]   - What other kind of stories can you tell?
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.920]   So a photon is a really boring story.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.520]   - Yeah, I mean, so that's a,
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.720]   I don't know if they're a boring story,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.360]   but I think it's, you know,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.760]   I've been wondering about this
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.680]   and I've been asking friends of mine
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.000]   who are science fiction writers and things,
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.320]   have you written stuff about this?
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.720]   And I've got one example,
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.200]   the great collection of books from my friend,
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.280]   Rudy Rooker, which were, which I have to say,
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.520]   they're books about, that are very informed
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.320]   by a bunch of science that I've done.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.480]   And the thing that I really loved about them is,
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.920]   you know, in the first chapter of the book,
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.960]   the Earth is consumed by these things he called Nantes,
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.720]   which are nano, nanobot type things.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.560]   - Nice.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.440]   - And it's, so, you know, so the Earth is gone
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.720]   in the first, but then it comes back.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.120]   But then-- - Spoiler alert.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.200]   - Yeah, right, that was only a micro spoiler.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.240]   It's only chapter one.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.080]   - Okay, good.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   - It's, but the thing that is not a real spoiler alert
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.200]   because it's such a complicated concept,
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.840]   but in the end, the Earth is saved by this thing
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.520]   called the principle of computational equivalence,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.760]   which is a kind of a core scientific idea of mine.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.680]   And I was just like, like thrilled.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.080]   I don't read fiction books very often.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.840]   And I was just thrilled I get to the end of this.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.160]   And it's like, oh my gosh, you know,
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.760]   everything is saved by this sort of
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.200]   deep scientific principle.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.640]   - Can you maybe elaborate how the principle
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.640]   of computational equivalence can save a planet?
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.840]   - That would be a terrible spoiler for real.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.680]   - That would be a spoiler, okay.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.760]   - Yeah, yeah, but no, but let me say what
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.120]   the principle of computational equivalence is.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.920]   So the question is, you have a system, you have some rule.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.320]   You can think of its behavior
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.360]   as corresponding to a computation.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.580]   The question is, how sophisticated is that computation?
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.800]   The statement of the principle of computational equivalence
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.440]   is as soon as it's not obviously simple,
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.840]   it will be as sophisticated as anything.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.720]   And so that has the implication that, you know, rule 30,
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.920]   you know, our brains, other things in physics,
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.520]   they're all ultimately equivalent
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.240]   in the computations they can do.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.360]   And that's what leads to this
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.000]   computational irreducibility idea,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   because the reason we don't get to jump ahead,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.320]   you know, and out think rule 30,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.240]   is because we're just computationally equivalent to rule 30.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.520]   So we're kind of just both just running computations
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.880]   that are the same sort of raw,
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.000]   the same level of computation, so to speak.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.360]   So that's kind of the idea there.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.720]   And the question, I mean, it's like,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.240]   you know, in the science fiction version would be,
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.800]   okay, somebody says, we just need more servers,
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.960]   get us more servers.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.400]   The way to get even more servers is turn the whole planet
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.920]   into a bunch of micro servers.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.320]   And that's where it starts.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.160]   And so the question of, you know,
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.320]   computational equivalence,
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.720]   principle of computational equivalence is,
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.360]   well, actually, you don't need to build those custom servers.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.360]   Actually, you can just use natural computation
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.200]   to compute things, so to speak.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.120]   You can use nature to compute.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.040]   You don't need to have done all that engineering.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.840]   And it's kind of feels a little disappointing
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.880]   that you say, we're going to build all these servers.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.960]   We're going to do all these things.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.000]   We're going to make, you know,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.520]   maybe we're going to have human consciousness
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.160]   uploaded into, you know, some elaborate digital environment.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.920]   And then you look at that thing and you say,
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.040]   it's got electrons moving around, just like in a rock.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.240]   And then you say, well, what's the difference?
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.560]   And the principle of computational equivalence says,
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.720]   there isn't at some level a fundamental, you know,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.280]   you can't say mathematically,
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.560]   there's a fundamental difference between the rock
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.680]   that is the future of human consciousness
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.640]   and the rock that's just a rock.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.800]   Now, what I've sort of realized
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.760]   with this kind of consciousness thing is
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.720]   that isn't, and for example,
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.480]   something I haven't really teased apart properly
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.480]   is when it comes to something like the weather
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.640]   and the weather having a mind of its own or whatever,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.440]   or your average, you know, pulsar magnetosphere
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.680]   acting like a sort of intelligent thing,
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.000]   how does that relate to, you know,
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.320]   how is that entity related to the kind of consciousness
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.920]   that we have and sort of what would the world look like,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.160]   you know, to the weather?
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.600]   If we think about the weather as a mind,
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.680]   what will it perceive?
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.240]   What will its laws of physics be?
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.720]   I don't really know.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.440]   - 'Cause it's very parallel.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.160]   - It's very parallel among other things.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.400]   And it's not obvious.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.480]   I mean, this is a really kind of mind bending thing
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.840]   'cause we've got to try and imagine where, you know,
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.160]   we've got to try and imagine a parsing of the universe
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.800]   different from the one we have.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.480]   And by the way, when we think about
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.920]   extraterrestrial intelligence and so on,
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.880]   I think that's kind of the key thing is, you know,
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.120]   we have always assumed, I've always assumed,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.840]   okay, the extraterrestrials,
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.200]   at least they have the same physics.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.840]   We all live in the same universe.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.440]   They've got the same physics.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.040]   But actually that's not really right
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.320]   because the extraterrestrials
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.400]   could have a completely different way of parsing
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.280]   that the universe.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.400]   So it's as if, you know, there could be for all we know,
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.680]   right here in this room, you know,
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.760]   in the details of the motion of these gas molecules,
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:22.600]   there could be an amazing intelligence that we were like,
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.800]   but we have no way of,
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.640]   we're not parsing the universe in the same way.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.560]   If only we could parse the universe in the right way,
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.880]   you know, immediately this amazing thing that's going on
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.000]   and this, you know, huge culture that's developed
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   and all that kind of thing would be obvious to us.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.920]   But it's not because we have our particular way
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.760]   of parsing the universe.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.960]   - Would that thing also have an agency?
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.240]   I don't know the right word to use,
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.840]   but something like consciousness,
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.120]   but a different kind of consciousness?
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.280]   - I think it's a question of just what you mean by the word,
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.720]   because I think that the, you know,
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.560]   this notion of consciousness and the, okay,
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.520]   so some people think of consciousness
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:00.840]   as sort of a key aspect of it is that we feel that,
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.360]   the sort of a feeling of that we exist in some way,
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.120]   that we have this intrinsic feeling about ourselves.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.920]   You know, I suspect that any of these things
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.320]   would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.160]   I've been sort of trying to think recently
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.080]   about constructing an experiment
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.840]   about what if you were just a piece of a cellular automaton,
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.320]   let's say, you know,
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.200]   what would your feeling about yourself actually be?
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.640]   And, you know, can we put ourselves in the shoes,
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.520]   in the cells of the cellular automaton, so to speak?
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.600]   Can we get ourselves close enough to that,
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:38.200]   that we could have a sense of what the world would be like
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.720]   if you were operating in that way?
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.680]   And it's a little difficult because, you know,
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.080]   you have to not only think about what are you perceiving,
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.560]   but also what's actually going on in your brain,
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.000]   and our brains do what they actually do.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.720]   And they don't, it's, you know,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.000]   I think there might be some experiments that are possible
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   with, you know, neural nets and so on,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.520]   where you can have something where you can at least see
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.040]   in detail what's happening inside the system.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.560]   And I've been sort of one of my projects to think about is,
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.440]   is there a way of kind of getting a sense
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.960]   kind of from inside the system
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.680]   about what its view of the world is and how it, you know,
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.320]   can we make a bridge?
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.320]   See, the main issue is this, where, you know,
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.480]   it's a sort of philosophically difficult thing,
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.920]   because it's like, we do what we do.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.440]   We understand ourselves, at least to some extent.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.880]   - We humans understand ourselves.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.760]   - That's correct.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.720]   And, but yet, okay, so what are we trying to do,
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.280]   for example, when we are trying to make a model of physics,
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.000]   what are we actually trying to do?
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.320]   Because, you know, you say, well,
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.440]   can we work out what the universe does?
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.360]   Well, of course we can, we just watch the universe.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.080]   The universe does what it does.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.720]   But what we're trying to do when we make a model of physics
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.120]   is we're trying to get to the point
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.680]   where we can tell a story to ourselves
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.840]   that we understand that is also a representation
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.480]   of what the universe does.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.680]   So it's this kind of, you know,
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.960]   can we make a bridge between what we humans
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.480]   can understand in our minds and what the universe does?
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.240]   And in a sense, you know, a large part of my kind of life
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.160]   efforts have been devoted to making computational language,
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.120]   which kind of is a bridge between what is possible
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.840]   in the computational universe
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.120]   and what we humans can conceptualize and think about.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.760]   In a sense, what, you know, when I built Wolfram Language
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.520]   and our whole sort of computational language story,
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.400]   it's all about how do you take sort of raw computation
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.720]   and this ocean of computational possibility
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.880]   and how do we sort of represent pieces of it
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.080]   in a way that we humans can understand
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.720]   and that map onto things that we care about doing.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.080]   And in a sense, when you add physics,
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.360]   you're adding this other piece where we can,
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.360]   you know, mediated by a computer,
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.560]   can we get physics to the point where we humans
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.360]   can understand something about what's happening in it?
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.800]   And when we talk about an alien intelligence,
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.040]   it's kind of the same story.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.280]   It's like, is there a way of mapping what's happening there
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.760]   onto something that we humans can understand?
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.760]   And, you know, physics in some sense is like our exhibit one
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.600]   of the story of alien intelligence.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.240]   It's a, you know, it's an alien intelligence in some sense.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.000]   And what we're doing in making a model of physics
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.080]   is mapping that onto something that we understand.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.160]   And I think, you know, a lot of these other things
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.080]   that I've recently been kind of studying,
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:28.240]   whether it's molecular biology, other kinds of things,
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.800]   which we can talk about a bit,
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.920]   those are other cases where we're in a sense
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.600]   trying to again, make that bridge
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.840]   between what we humans understand
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840]   and sort of the natural language
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.280]   of that sort of alien intelligence in some sense.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.240]   - When you're talking about,
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   just to backtrack a little bit,
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.280]   about cellular automata being able to,
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.960]   what's it like to be a cellular automata
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.880]   in the way that's equivalent
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.860]   to what is it like to be a conscious human being?
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.320]   How do you approach that?
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.040]   So is it looking at some subset of the cellular automata,
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.520]   asking questions of that subset,
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.680]   like how the world is perceived,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.200]   how you as that subset,
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.640]   like for that local pocket of computation,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   what are you able to say about the broader cellular automata?
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.720]   And that somehow then can give you a sense
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.480]   of how to step outside of that cellular automata.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   - Right, but the tricky part is that that little subset,
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.520]   it's what it's doing is it has a view of itself.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.280]   And the question is, how do you get inside it?
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.840]   It's like, when we with humans, right?
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.840]   It's like, we can't get inside each other's consciousness.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.780]   That doesn't really even make sense.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.480]   It's like, there is an experience
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.800]   that somebody is having,
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.440]   but you can perceive things from the outside,
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.560]   but sort of getting inside it,
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.400]   it doesn't quite make sense.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.840]   And for me, these sort of philosophical issues
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.200]   and this one I have not untangled.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.080]   So let's be, for me,
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.600]   the thing that has been really interesting
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.760]   in thinking through some of these things is,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.120]   when it comes to questions about consciousness
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.360]   or whatever else, it's like, when I can run a program
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.360]   and actually see pictures and make things concrete,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.840]   I have a much better chance to understand what's going on
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.720]   than when I'm just trying to reason about things
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.760]   in a very abstract way.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.760]   - Yeah, but there may be a way to map the program
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.280]   to your conscious experience.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.060]   So for example, when you play a video game,
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.640]   you do a first person shooter,
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.880]   you walk around inside this entity,
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.020]   it's a very different thing than watching this entity.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:45.560]   So if you can somehow connect more and more,
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.960]   connect this full conscious experience
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.280]   to the subset of the cellular automata.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.440]   - Yeah, it's something like that.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.280]   But the difference in the first person shooter thing
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.580]   is there's still your brain and your memory
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:02.420]   is still remembering, you still have, it's hard to,
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.960]   I mean, again, what one's gonna get,
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.480]   one is not going to actually be able
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.200]   to be the cellular automaton.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.280]   One's gonna be able to watch
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.000]   what the cellular automaton does.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.280]   But this is the frustrating thing
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.780]   that I'm trying to understand,
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:18.240]   you know, how to think about being it, so to speak.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.800]   - Okay, so like in virtual reality,
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.320]   there's a concept of immersion,
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.440]   like with anything, with video game, with books,
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.940]   there's a concept of immersion.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.720]   It feels like over time,
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.000]   if the virtual reality experience is well done,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.880]   and maybe in the future it'll be extremely well done,
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.680]   the immersion leads you to feel like,
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.000]   you mentioned memories,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.960]   you forget that you even ever existed
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.720]   outside that experience.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.500]   - Yeah. - It's so immersive.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.400]   I mean, you could argue sort of mathematically
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.960]   that you can never truly become immersed,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.560]   but maybe you can.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.760]   I mean, why can't you merge with the cellular automaton?
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.600]   - Yeah, right.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.920]   - I mean, aren't you just part of the same fabric?
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.520]   Why can't you just like--
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.640]   - Well, that's a good question.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.920]   I mean, so let's imagine the following scenario.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.280]   Let's imagine-- - Then can you return?
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.120]   (laughing)
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:05.940]   - What's that?
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.240]   - But then can you return back?
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.080]   - Well, yeah, right.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.000]   I mean, it's like, let's imagine you've uploaded,
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.520]   you know, your brain is scanned,
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.560]   you've got every synapse, you know, mapped out.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.760]   You upload everything about you,
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.080]   the brain simulator, you upload the brain simulator,
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.900]   and the brain simulator is basically, you know,
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.200]   some glorified cellular automaton.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.400]   And then you say, well, now we've got an answer
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.720]   to what does it feel like to be a cellular automaton?
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.320]   It feels just like it felt to be ordinary you,
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.680]   because they're both computational systems,
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.720]   and they're both, you know, operating in the same way.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.880]   So in a sense, but I think there's somehow more to it,
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.200]   because in that sense,
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.280]   when you're just making a brain simulator,
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.980]   it's just, you know, we're just saying
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:47.680]   there's another version of our consciousness.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.400]   The question that we're asking is,
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.160]   if we tease away from our consciousness
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.100]   and get to something that is different,
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.340]   how do we make a bridge
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.240]   to understanding what's going on there?
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.560]   And, you know, there's a way of thinking about this.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.020]   Okay, so this is coming on to sort of questions
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.040]   about the existence of the universe and so on.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.600]   But one of the things is there's this notion
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.220]   that we have of ruleal space.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.760]   So we have this idea of this physical space,
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.160]   which is, you know, something you can move around in
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.660]   that's associated with the actual,
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.820]   the extent of the spatial hypergraph.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.080]   Then there's what we call branchial space,
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.640]   the space of quantum branches.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.600]   So in this thing we call the multi-way graph
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.980]   of all of this sort of branching histories,
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.340]   there's this idea of a kind of space
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.760]   where instead of moving around in physical space,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.280]   you're moving from history to history, so to speak,
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.700]   from one possible history to another possible history.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.300]   And that's kind of a different kind of space
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.660]   that is the space in which quantum mechanics plays out.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.060]   Quantum mechanics, like for example,
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:49.060]   or something like, I think we're slowly understanding
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.780]   things like destructive interference in quantum mechanics.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.340]   That what's happening is branchial space
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.960]   is associated with phase in quantum mechanics.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.700]   And what's happening is the two photons
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.780]   that are supposed to be interfering
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:01.940]   and destructively interfering
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.420]   are winding up at different ends of branchial space.
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.700]   And so us, as these poor observers that are trying to,
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.380]   that have branching brains,
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.100]   that are trying to conflate together
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.040]   these different threads of history,
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.040]   and say, we've really got a consistent story
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.120]   that we're telling here.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.460]   We're really knitting together these threads of history.
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.300]   By the time the two photons
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.820]   wound up at opposite ends of branchial space,
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.860]   we just can't knit them together to tell a consistent story.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.180]   So for us, that's sort of the analog
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.060]   of destructive interference.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.040]   - Got it, and then there's rule-ial space too,
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.900]   which is the space of rules.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.060]   - Yes, well, that's another level up.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.980]   So there's the question,
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.140]   actually, I do want to mention one thing,
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:43.080]   'cause it's something I've realized in recent times,
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.560]   and I think it's really, really kind of cool,
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.280]   which is about time dilation in relativity.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.240]   And it kind of helps to understand,
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.080]   it's something that kind of helps
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.300]   in understanding what's going on.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:55.060]   So according to relativity,
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.000]   if you have a clock, it's ticking at a certain rate,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.480]   you send it in a spacecraft
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.520]   that's going at some significant fraction
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.800]   of the speed of light,
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.440]   to you as an observer at rest,
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.720]   that clock that's in the spacecraft
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.240]   will seem to be ticking much more slowly.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.480]   And so in other words, it's kind of like
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.760]   the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.260]   and goes very fast will age much less
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.360]   than the twin who's on Earth
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.800]   that is just hanging out where they're hanging out.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.440]   Okay, why does that happen?
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.800]   Okay, so it has to do with what motion is.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.660]   So in our models of physics, what is motion?
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.980]   Well, when you move from somewhere to somewhere,
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:38.440]   it's you having to sort of recreate yourself
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.640]   at a different place in space.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.720]   When you exist at a particular place
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.440]   and you just evolve with time,
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.240]   you're again, you're updating yourself,
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.360]   you're following these rules to update what happens.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.000]   Well, so the question is,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.560]   when you have a certain amount of computation in you,
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.600]   so to speak, when there's a certain amount,
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.760]   you know, you're computing,
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.920]   the universe is computing at a certain rate,
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.120]   you can either use that computation
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.960]   to work out sitting still where you are,
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.440]   what's going to happen successively in time,
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.180]   or you can use that computation
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.200]   to recreate yourself as you move around the universe.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.560]   And so time dilation ends up being,
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.680]   it's really cool actually that this is explainable
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.480]   in a way that isn't just,
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.600]   imagine the mathematics of relativity.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.200]   But that time dilation is a story of the fact that
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.980]   as you kind of are recreating yourself as you move,
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.240]   you are using up some of your computation.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.100]   And so you don't have as much computation left over
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.120]   to actually work out what happens progressively with time.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:38.300]   So that means that time is running more slowly for you
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:41.900]   because it is, you're using up your computation,
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.560]   your clock can't tick as quickly
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.180]   because every tick of the clock
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.420]   is using up some computation,
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:49.380]   but you already use that computation up
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:52.420]   on moving at half the speed of light or something.
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.660]   And so that's why time dilation happens.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.620]   And so you can start,
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:58.900]   so it's kind of interesting
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.380]   that one can sort of get an intuition
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:01.660]   about something like that,
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.320]   because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.300]   about the mathematics of special relativity and so on.
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.220]   - Well, for me, it's a little bit confusing
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.420]   what the U in that picture is,
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:15.020]   'cause you're using up computation.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.940]   - Okay, so we're simply saying the entity
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.740]   is updating itself according to
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:24.220]   the way that the universe updates itself.
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:27.580]   And the question is, those updates,
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.300]   let's imagine the U is a clock, okay?
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.820]   And the clock is, there's all these little updates,
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:35.560]   the hypergraph and a sequence of updates
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.900]   cause the pendulum to swing back the other way
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:41.280]   and then swing back and forth, okay?
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.200]   And all of those updates are contributing
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.800]   to the motion of the pendulum going back and forth
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.280]   or the little oscillator moving, whatever it is, okay?
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.640]   But then the alternative is that sort of situation one,
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.200]   where the thing is at rest,
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.400]   situation two, where it's kind of moving,
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.440]   what's happening is it is having to recreate itself
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.320]   at every moment.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.640]   The thing is going to have to do the computations
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.240]   to be able to sort of recreate itself
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.000]   at a different position in space.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.040]   And that's kind of the intuition behind,
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.780]   so it's either going to spend its computation
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:19.400]   recreating itself at a different position in space,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.160]   or it's gonna spend its computation
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:27.940]   sort of doing the updating of the ticking of the clock,
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:28.780]   so to speak.
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.360]   - So the more updating it's doing,
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.480]   the less the ticking of the clock update is doing.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.320]   - That's right.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.480]   The more it's having to update because of motion,
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.980]   the less it can update the clock.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:42.160]   So that's, I mean, obviously there's a sort
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.880]   of mathematical version of it that relates
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.800]   to how it actually works in relativity,
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.840]   but that's kind of, to me, that was sort of exciting to me
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.640]   that it's possible to have a really mechanically
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.560]   explainable story there that isn't,
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.120]   and similarly in quantum mechanics,
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.680]   this notion of branching brains,
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.360]   perceiving branching universes,
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.920]   to me, that's getting towards a sort
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.880]   of mechanically explainable version
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.200]   of what happens in quantum mechanics,
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.600]   even though it's a little bit mind bending
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.960]   to see these things about under what circumstances
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.240]   can you successfully knit together
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.000]   those different threads of history,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.800]   and when do things sort of escape,
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.400]   and those kinds of things.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:21.200]   But the thing about this physical space,
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:25.040]   in physical space, the main sort of big theory
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.140]   is general relativity, the theory of gravity,
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.400]   and that tells you how things move in physical space.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.180]   In branchial space, the big theory
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:35.480]   is the Feynman path integral, which it turns out,
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.320]   tells you essentially how things move
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.040]   in the space of quantum phases.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.900]   So it's kind of like motion in branchial space.
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.620]   And it's kind of a fun thing to start thinking about
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:48.340]   what, oh, you know, all these things
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.960]   that we know in physical space,
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.480]   like event horizons and black holes and so on,
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.860]   what are the analogous things in branchial space?
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:55.940]   For example, the speed of light,
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.700]   what's the analog of the speed of light in branchial space?
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.540]   It's the maximum speed of quantum entanglement.
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:05.580]   So the speed of light is a flashbulb goes off here,
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:08.180]   what's the maximum rate at which the effect
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:12.700]   of that flashbulb is detectable moving away in space?
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.840]   So similarly, in branchial space, something happens,
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.500]   and the question is, how far in this branchial space,
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.420]   in the space of quantum states,
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.920]   how far away can that get within a certain period of time?
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:27.100]   And so there's this notion of a maximum entanglement speed,
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.900]   and that might be observable.
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:31.200]   That's the thing we've been sort of poking at,
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.880]   is might there be a way to observe it
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.660]   even in some atomic physics kind of situation?
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:39.260]   'Cause one of the things that's weird in quantum mechanics
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.000]   is when we study quantum mechanics,
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.140]   we mostly study it in terms of small numbers of particles.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.580]   You know, this electron does this,
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.420]   this thing on an ion trap does that, and so on.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:51.460]   But when we deal with large numbers of particles,
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:52.440]   kind of all bets are off.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.140]   It's kind of too complicated to deal with quantum mechanics.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:57.300]   And so what ends up happening is,
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.320]   so this question about maximum entanglement speed
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.300]   and things like that may actually play in one of these,
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.180]   in the sort of story of many-body quantum mechanics,
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:08.860]   and even have some suspicions about things
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.860]   that might happen even in,
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.620]   one of the things I realized I'd never understood,
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:14.740]   and it's kind of embarrassing,
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.180]   but I think I now understand a little better,
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:20.660]   is when you have chemistry and you have quantum mechanics,
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.260]   it's like, well, there's two carbon atoms.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.560]   There's this molecule, and we do a reaction,
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.920]   and we draw a diagram, and we say,
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.160]   this carbon atom ends up in this place.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.480]   And it's like, but wait a minute.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.920]   In quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite place.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.380]   There's always just some wave function for this to happen.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:37.400]   How can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable,
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.080]   it just ended up in this place?
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.000]   And you have to kind of say,
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.120]   well, the environment of the molecule
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.960]   effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.800]   to keep it kind of classical.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   And that's a story that has to do with this whole thing
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:54.600]   about measurements have to do with this idea of,
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.080]   can we conclude that something definite happened?
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.520]   Because in quantum mechanics,
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.380]   the intrinsic quantum mechanics,
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.640]   the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about,
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640]   they're just these amplitudes
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.160]   for different things to happen.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:08.200]   Then there's this thing of, and then we make a measurement,
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.680]   and we conclude that something definite happened.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.960]   And that has to do with this thing, I think,
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.560]   about sort of moving, about knitting together
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.200]   these different threads of history and saying,
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.220]   this is now something where we can definitively say
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.360]   something definite happened.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.620]   In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics,
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.440]   it's just like,
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.680]   after you've done all this amplitude computation,
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.720]   then this big hammer comes down and you do a measurement,
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:31.800]   and it's all over.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.080]   And that's been very confusing,
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.800]   for example, in quantum computing,
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.160]   it's been a very confusing thing because when you say,
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.360]   in quantum computing, the basic idea is you're gonna use
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.360]   all these separate threads of computation, so to speak,
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.180]   to do all the different parts of,
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.880]   try these different factors for an integer
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.100]   or something like this.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.080]   And it looks like you can do a lot
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.880]   because you've got all these different threads going on.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.180]   But then you have to say, well, at the end of it,
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.240]   you've got all these threads,
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.640]   and every thread came up with a definite answer,
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.600]   but we got to conflate those together
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.120]   to figure out a definite thing that we humans
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.880]   can take away from it, a definite,
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.340]   so the computer actually produced this output.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.660]   - So having this branchial space
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.520]   and this hypergraph model of physics,
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:16.660]   do you think it's possible to then make predictions
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:19.640]   that are definite about many body
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.400]   quantum mechanical systems?
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.240]   Is that the hope?
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.740]   - I think it's likely, yes.
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.580]   But I don't, you know, this is,
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:26.680]   every one of these things,
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.980]   when you go from the underlying theory,
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.760]   which is complicated enough, and it's,
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.600]   I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully simple,
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.280]   but as soon as you start actually trying to,
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.640]   it's this whole question about how do you bridge it
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.160]   to things that we humans can talk about,
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.700]   it gets really complicated.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:44.200]   And this thing about actually getting it
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.300]   to a definite prediction about, you know,
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.100]   definite thing you can say about chemistry
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.900]   or something like this, you know,
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:52.740]   that's just a lot of work.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.020]   So I'll give you an example.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.280]   There's a thing called the quantum Zeno effect.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.120]   So the idea is, you know, quantum stuff happens,
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.860]   but then if you make a measurement,
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.820]   you're kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:07.780]   And so it looks like there's a possibility
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.460]   that with sort of the relationship
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.180]   between the quantum Zeno effect
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.140]   and the way that many body quantum mechanics works
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:16.200]   and so on, maybe just conceivably,
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.360]   it may be possible to actually figure out a way
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.720]   to measure the maximum entanglement speed.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.060]   And the reason we can potentially do that
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.520]   is because the systems we deal with
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.720]   in terms of atoms and things, they're pretty big.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.760]   You know, a mole of atoms is, you know,
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.640]   it's a lot of atoms and, you know,
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.880]   but it isn't a very, you know,
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.160]   it's something where to get, you know,
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.880]   when we're dealing with how can you see 10
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.760]   to the minus 100, so to speak?
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.700]   Well, by the time you've got, you know,
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.380]   10 to the 30th atoms, you're not, you know,
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:47.900]   you're within a little bit closer striking distance of that.
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.620]   It's not like, oh, we've just got, you know,
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:52.980]   two atoms and we're trying to see down
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.400]   to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.180]   So I don't know how it will work,
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:00.020]   but this is a potential direction.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.020]   And if you can tell, by the way,
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.540]   if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed,
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.300]   we would know the elementary length.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.740]   These are all related.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.440]   So if we got that one number, we just need one number.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.640]   If we can get that one number, we can, you know,
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.120]   the theory has no parameters anymore.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.640]   And, you know, there are other places.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.920]   Well, there's another hope for doing that is in cosmology.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.760]   In this model, one of the features is
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.400]   the universe is not fixed dimensional.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.640]   I mean, we think we live in three-dimensional space,
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:31.480]   but this hypergraph doesn't have any particular dimension.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.080]   It can emerge as something which on an approximation,
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.440]   it's as if, you know, you say,
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.780]   what's the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:42.180]   where a sphere is defined as how many nodes do you get to
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:45.200]   when you go a distance R away from a given point?
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.380]   And you can say, well, if I get to about R cubed nodes,
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:51.900]   when I go a distance R away in the hypergraph,
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.500]   then I'm living roughly in three-dimensional space.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:59.080]   But you might also get to R to the point, you know, 2.92,
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.180]   you know, for some value of R in, you know,
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.080]   as R increases, that might be the sort of fit
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.300]   to what happens.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.200]   And so one of the things we suspect is that
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.180]   the very early universe was essentially
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:14.360]   infinite dimensional, and that as the universe expanded,
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.600]   it became lower dimensional.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.880]   And so one of the things that is another little sort of point
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.460]   where we think there might be a way
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:24.400]   to actually measure some things is dimension fluctuations
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.640]   in the early universe.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.760]   That is, is there a leftover dimension fluctuation of,
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.960]   at the time of the cosmic microwave background,
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.440]   100,000 years or something after the beginning
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:37.060]   of the universe, is it still the case that there were pieces
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.700]   of the universe that didn't have dimension three,
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.180]   that had dimension 3.01 or something?
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:43.500]   And can we tell that?
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.940]   - Is that possible to observe the fluctuations
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.200]   in dimensions?
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.180]   I don't even know what that entails.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.820]   - Okay, so the question, which should be an elementary
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:57.860]   exercise in electrodynamics, except it isn't,
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:00.440]   is understanding what happens to a photon
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.660]   when it propagates through 3.01 dimensional space.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.780]   So for example, the inverse square law is a consequence
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.300]   of the surface area of a sphere is proportional
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.580]   to R squared.
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.680]   But if you're not in three dimensional space,
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.260]   the surface area of a sphere is not proportional
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:22.460]   to R squared, it's R to the whatever, 2.01 or something.
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:27.460]   And so that means that I think when you try and do optics,
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:31.380]   a common principle in optics is Huygens principle,
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:34.280]   which basically says that every piece of a wave front
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:39.280]   of light is a source of new spherical waves.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.780]   And those spherical waves, if they're different dimensional
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:45.320]   spherical waves, will have other characteristics.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.360]   And so there will be bizarre optical phenomena,
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.000]   which we haven't figured out yet.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.880]   - So you're looking for some weird photon trajectories
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:59.860]   that designate that it's 3.01 dimensional space?
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:02.620]   - Yeah, yeah, that would be an example of, I mean,
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.540]   you know, there are only a certain number of things
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.180]   we can measure about photons.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.900]   You know, we can measure their polarization,
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.540]   we can measure their frequency,
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:12.660]   we can measure their direction, those kinds of things.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:15.540]   And you know, how that all works out,
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:19.300]   and you know, in the current models of physics,
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.800]   you know, it's been hard to explain how the universe
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.980]   manages to be as uniform as it is.
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:27.040]   And that's led to this inflation idea that,
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.680]   to the great annoyance of my then collaborator,
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:33.360]   we figured out in like 1979, we had this realization
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.320]   that you could get something like this,
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.180]   but it seemed implausible that that's the way
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:39.460]   the universe worked, so we put in a footnote.
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:42.480]   And that was, so that's a, but in any case,
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.740]   I've never really completely believed it,
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:48.520]   but that's an idea for how to sort of puff out the universe
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.000]   faster than the speed of light,
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.600]   early moments of the universe,
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.760]   that that's the sort of the inflation idea.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.820]   And that you can somehow explain how the universe manages
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:59.640]   to be as uniform as it is.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:03.320]   In our model, this turns out to be much more natural,
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.520]   because the universe just starts very connected.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.300]   The hypergraph is not such that the ball that you grow
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.960]   starting from a single point has volume R cubed,
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.700]   it might have volume R to the 500 or R to the infinity.
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.540]   And so that means that you sort of naturally get
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.700]   this much higher degree of connectivity and uniformity
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:22.760]   in the universe.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.560]   And then the question is,
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.400]   this is sort of the mathematical physics challenge,
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.200]   is in the standard theory of the universe,
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.640]   there's the Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe,
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.840]   which is the kind of standard model where the universe
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.980]   is isotropic and homogeneous,
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:38.720]   and you can then work out the equations of general relativity
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.260]   and you can figure out how the universe expands.
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:42.700]   We would like to do the same kind of thing,
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.720]   including dimension change.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.140]   This is just difficult mathematical physics.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.880]   I mean, the reason it's difficult
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.880]   is the sort of fundamental reason it's difficult.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.960]   When people invented calculus 300 years ago,
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:57.560]   calculus was a story of understanding change
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.040]   and change as a function of a variable.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.220]   And so people study univariate calculus,
[01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.760]   they study multivariate calculus,
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.440]   it's one variable, it's two variables, three variables,
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:10.880]   but whoever studied 2.5 variable calculus,
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.360]   turns out nobody.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.060]   Turns out that, but what we need to have
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:18.360]   to understand these fractional dimensional spaces,
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.960]   which don't work like,
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.080]   well, they're spaces where the effective dimension
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.840]   is not an integer.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.160]   - So you can't apply the tools of calculus
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.440]   and naturally and easily to fractional dimensions.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.280]   - No.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.040]   - So somebody has to figure out how to do that.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.720]   - Yeah, yeah, we're trying to figure this out.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.560]   I mean, it's very interesting.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.280]   I mean, it's very connected to very frontier issues
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.120]   in mathematics.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.240]   It's very beautiful, but-
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.720]   - So is it possible, is it possible,
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:48.200]   we're dealing with a scale that's so, so much smaller
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.480]   than our human scale.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.720]   Is it possible to make predictions versus explanations?
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:57.440]   Do you have a hope that with this hypergraph model,
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.080]   you'd be able to make predictions?
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:32:59.920]   - Yeah.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:04.360]   - That then could be validated with a physics experiment,
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.360]   predictions that couldn't have been done
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.680]   or weren't done otherwise?
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:08.520]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.360]   I mean, you know, I think-
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.000]   - In which domain do you think that prediction will-
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.960]   - Okay, so there are gonna be cosmology ones
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.800]   to do with dimension fluctuations in the universe.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.240]   That's a very bizarre effect.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.760]   Nobody, you know, dimension fluctuation is just something,
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.640]   nobody ever looked for that.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.240]   If anybody sees dimension fluctuation, that's a huge flag,
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.120]   that's something like our model is going on.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.880]   If, and how one detects that, you know,
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.720]   that's a problem of kind of, you know,
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.760]   that's a problem of traditional physics in a sense
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.840]   of what's the best way to actually figure that out.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.760]   And for example, that's one,
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.360]   there are all kinds of things one can imagine.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.560]   I mean, there are things that in black hole mergers,
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.240]   it's possible that there will be effects
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:50.840]   of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole mergers.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:53.080]   That's another possible thing.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.440]   - And all of that is detected through like what?
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.840]   Do you have a hope for LIGO type of situation?
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.520]   Like that's gravitational waves?
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.480]   - Yeah, or alternatively, I mean, I think it's, you know,
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.840]   look, figuring out experiments
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.760]   is like figuring out technology inventions.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.160]   That is, you know, you've got a set of raw materials,
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.800]   you've got an underlying model,
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.500]   and now you've got to be very clever
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.960]   to figure out, you know, what is that thing I can measure
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.800]   that just somehow, you know,
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.040]   leverages into the right place.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.700]   And we've spent less effort on that than I would have liked,
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.280]   because one of the reasons is that I think that the,
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:32.360]   you know, the physicists who've been working on our models,
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.480]   and we've now, lots of physicists actually,
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.320]   it's very, very nice.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.640]   It's kind of, you know, it's one of these cases
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.500]   where I'm almost, I'm really kind of pleasantly surprised
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.720]   that the sort of absorption of the things we've done
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.640]   has been quite rapid and quite sort of,
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.880]   you know, very positive.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.000]   - So it's a Cambrian explosion of physicists too,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.400]   not just ideas.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.340]   - Yes, I mean, you know, a lot of what's happened
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.960]   that's really interesting, and again,
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.680]   not what I expected is, there are a lot of areas
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.240]   of sort of very elaborate,
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.320]   sophisticated mathematical physics,
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.920]   whether that's causal set theory,
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.520]   whether it's higher category theory,
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.820]   whether it's categorical quantum mechanics,
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:12.080]   all sorts of elaborate names for these things,
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.760]   spin networks, perhaps, you know,
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.340]   causal dynamical triangulations,
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.600]   all kinds of names of these fields.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.320]   And these fields have a bunch
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.120]   of good mathematical physicists in them
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.240]   who've been working for decades in these particular areas.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.880]   And the question is,
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.840]   but they've been building these mathematical structures,
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.600]   and the mathematical structures are interesting,
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.100]   but they don't typically sit on anything.
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.040]   They're just mathematical structures.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.440]   And I think what's happened is our models provide
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.400]   kind of a machine code that lives underneath those models.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.720]   So a typical example, this is due to Jonathan Gorod,
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.080]   who's one of the key people
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.400]   who's been working on our project.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.680]   This is in, okay, so I'll give you an example,
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.320]   just to give a sense of how these things connect.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.040]   This is in causal set theory.
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:02.080]   So the idea of causal set theory is there are,
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.080]   in space-time, we imagine that there's space and time,
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.360]   it's a three plus one dimensional, you know, setup.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.320]   We imagine that there are just events that happen
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.440]   at different times and places in space and time.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.800]   And the idea of causal set theory is the only thing
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.520]   you say about the universe is there are a bunch of events
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.400]   that happen sort of randomly
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.360]   at different places in space and time.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.480]   And then the whole sort of theory of physics
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:30.680]   has to be to do with this graph of causal relationships
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.040]   between these randomly thrown down events.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.080]   So they've always been confused by the fact that
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.500]   to get even Lorentz invariance,
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.080]   even relativistic invariance,
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.040]   you need a very special way to throw down those events.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.560]   And they've had no natural way
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.400]   to understand how that would happen.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.800]   So what Jonathan figured out is that,
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:50.480]   in fact, from our models,
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:55.200]   they, instead of just generating events at random,
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.880]   our models necessarily generate events in some pattern
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.080]   in space-time effectively,
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.880]   that then leads to Lorentz invariance
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:05.200]   and relativistic invariance and all those kinds of things.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.200]   So it's a place where all the mathematics
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.040]   that's been done on,
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.400]   well, we just have a random collection of events.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.800]   Now, what consequences does that have
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.300]   in terms of causal set theory and so on?
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.360]   That can all be kind of wheeled in
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.760]   now that we have some different underlying foundational idea
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:23.880]   for what the particular distribution of events is
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.560]   as opposed to just where we throw down random events.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.920]   And so that's a typical sort of example
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.640]   of what we're seeing in all these different areas
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.880]   of kind of how you can take really interesting things
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.640]   that have been done in mathematical physics
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.480]   and connect them.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.160]   And it's really kind of beautiful
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.600]   because the sort of the abstract models we have
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.920]   just seem to plug into all these different,
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.760]   very interesting, very elegant, abstract ideas,
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.120]   but we're now giving sort of a reason
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.160]   for that to be the way,
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.820]   for a reason for one to care.
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.920]   I mean, it's like saying,
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.720]   you can think about computation abstractly.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:01.800]   You can think about, I don't know,
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.760]   combinators or something as abstract computational things.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:07.480]   And you can sort of do all kinds of study of them,
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.260]   but it's like, why do we care?
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:11.080]   Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:11.920]   'cause you can kind of see
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.620]   they're sort of mechanically doing things.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:16.160]   But when we actually start thinking about computers
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.360]   computing things, we have a really good reason to care.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.920]   And this is sort of what we're providing, I think,
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.360]   is a reason to care about a lot of these areas
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.200]   of mathematical physics.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.200]   So that's been very nice.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.440]   - So I'm not sure we've ever got to the question
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.480]   of why does the universe exist at all.
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.240]   Let's talk about that.
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.200]   So it's not the simplest question in the world.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.640]   So it takes a few steps to get to it.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.920]   - And it's nevertheless even surprising
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.040]   that you can even begin to answer this question,
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.220]   as you were saying.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.680]   - I'm very surprised.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.880]   So the next thing to perhaps understand
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.180]   is this idea of ruleal space.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:57.540]   So we've got kind of physical space,
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:58.920]   we've got branchial space,
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.360]   the space of possible quantum histories.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.560]   And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction,
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.880]   which is ruleal space.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.180]   And here's where that comes from.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.400]   So you say, okay, you say,
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.480]   we've got this model for the universe,
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.080]   we've got a particular rule,
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.420]   and we run this rule and we get the universe.
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:19.640]   Okay, so that's interesting.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:20.520]   Why that rule?
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.160]   Why not another rule?
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.600]   And so that confused me for a long time.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.600]   And I realized, well, actually,
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.000]   what if the thing could be using all possible rules?
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.660]   What if at every step,
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:34.800]   in addition to saying apply a particular rule
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.720]   at all places in this hypergraph,
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.320]   one could say, just take all possible rules
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.640]   and apply all possible rules
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:43.160]   at all possible places in this hypergraph.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.380]   Okay, and then you make this ruleal multi-way graph,
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.840]   which both is all possible histories
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.480]   for a particular rule and all possible rules.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.860]   So the next thing you'd say is,
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.560]   how can you get anything reasonable out of it?
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.360]   How can anything real come out of
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.560]   the set of all possible rules applied
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.980]   in all possible ways?
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:02.760]   Okay, this is a subtle thing,
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.060]   so which I haven't fully untangled.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:07.320]   There is this object,
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:10.220]   which is the result of running all possible rules
[01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:11.640]   in all possible ways.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.340]   And you might say, if you're running all possible rules,
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.840]   why can't everything possible happen?
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.520]   Well, the answer is because when you,
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.940]   there's sort of this entanglement that occurs.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.560]   So let's say that you have
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.840]   a lot of different possible initial conditions,
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.760]   a lot of different possible states.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.800]   Then you're applying these different rules.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.600]   Well, some of those rules can end up with the same state.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.100]   So it isn't the case that you can just get
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:37.360]   from anywhere to anywhere.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.580]   There's this whole entangled structure
[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:41.120]   of what can lead to what,
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.560]   and there's a definite structure that's produced.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.200]   I think I'm gonna call that definite structure
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.400]   the Rulliad,
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.680]   the limit of kind of all possible rules
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:52.280]   being applied in all possible ways.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.580]   - And you're saying that structure is finite,
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:57.580]   so that somehow connects to maybe a similar kind of thing
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:59.560]   as like causal invariance.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.960]   - Well, it happens that the Rulliad
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:02.760]   necessarily has causal invariance.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.820]   That's a feature of,
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:05.560]   that's just a mathematical consequence
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.240]   of essentially using all possible rules
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:11.300]   plus universal computation gives you the fact
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.180]   that for many diverging paths,
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:15.440]   you can always, the paths will always converge.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.760]   - But does that say that the Rulli,
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.760]   does that necessarily infer that the Rulliad is a finite?
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.960]   - In the end, it's not necessarily finite.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.320]   I mean, it's a,
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.940]   just like the history of the universe may not be finite.
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:31.520]   The history of the universe, time may keep going forever.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:34.120]   You can keep running the computations of the Rulliad
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.320]   and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.720]   It's like time doesn't have to end.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:44.440]   It's that, but the issue is there are three limits
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.520]   that happen in this Rulliad object.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.280]   One is how long you run the computation for.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.240]   Another is how many different rules you're applying.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.440]   And another is how many different states you start from.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.400]   And the mixture of those three limits,
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.160]   I mean, this is just mathematically a horrendous object.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:04.080]   And what's interesting about this object is
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.740]   the one thing that does seem to be the case
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.960]   about this object is it connects with ideas
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.520]   in higher category theory.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.600]   And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th century's
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:17.000]   most abstract mathematics done by this chap Grothendieck.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.560]   Grothendieck had a thing called the infinity groupoid,
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:23.060]   which is closely related to this Rulliad object.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:25.320]   Although the details of the relationship,
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.320]   I don't fully understand yet.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.120]   But I think that what's interesting is this thing
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.840]   that is sort of this very limiting object.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.520]   So, okay, so a way to think about this,
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:40.080]   that again, will take us into another direction,
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.400]   which is the equivalence between physics and mathematics.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:48.400]   The way that, well, let's see, maybe this is,
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.240]   just to give a sense of this kind of groupoid
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.080]   and things like that.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.780]   You can think about, in mathematics,
[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:55.700]   you can think you have certain axioms,
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:58.860]   they're kind of like atoms, and you,
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:00.860]   well, actually, let's say,
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:02.340]   let's talk about mathematics for a second.
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.500]   So what is mathematics?
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.340]   What is it made of, so to speak?
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:08.280]   Mathematics, there's a bunch of statements,
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:12.220]   like for addition, X plus Y is equal to Y plus X.
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.260]   That's a statement of mathematics.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:15.740]   Another statement would be, you know,
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:18.900]   X squared minus one is equal to X plus one X minus one.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:21.260]   There are infinite number of these possible statements
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.100]   of mathematics.
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.500]   - So it's not, I mean, it's not just, I guess, a statement,
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:28.020]   but with X plus Y, it's a rule that you can,
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.980]   it's a, I mean, you think of it as a rule.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:32.480]   - It's a, it is a rule.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.860]   It's also just a thing that is true in mathematics.
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.740]   - Right, it's a statement of truth, okay.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.940]   - Right, and what you can imagine is,
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.140]   you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:47.460]   of all statements, well, actually, you first start,
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:48.820]   okay, this is where,
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:50.480]   this, we're segueing into a different thing.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.340]   Let me not go in this direction for a second.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.420]   - Let's not go to meta-mathematics just yet.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:56.500]   - Yeah, we'll maybe get to meta-mathematics,
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:59.500]   but it's, so let me not,
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.380]   let me explain the groupoid and things later.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.220]   - Yes.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:05.440]   - But, so let's come back to the universe,
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:07.540]   always a good place to be in, so to speak.
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:09.420]   - Yeah, so what does the universe have to do
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:11.340]   with the Rulliad, the Rullio space,
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:15.180]   and how that's possibly connected
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:17.060]   to why the thing exists at all,
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:18.800]   and why there's just one of them?
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.940]   - Yes, okay, so here's the point.
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:24.260]   So the thing that had confused me for a long time was,
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.780]   let's say we get the rule for the universe.
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:27.660]   We hold it in our hand.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.420]   We say, "This is our universe."
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:30.580]   Then the immediate question is,
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:32.420]   "Well, why isn't it another one?"
[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.180]   And that's kind of the,
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:37.100]   the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is,
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.300]   we're not very special.
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:42.440]   So how come we got universe number 312
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:46.060]   and not universe quadrillion, quadrillion, quadrillion?
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:48.640]   And I think the resolution of that is the realization
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.640]   that the universe is running all possible rules.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.040]   So then you say, "Well, how on earth do we perceive
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.560]   "the universe to be running according to a particular rule?
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.260]   "How do we perceive definite things
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:03.140]   "happening in the universe?"
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:05.620]   Well, it's the same story.
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:07.100]   It's the observer.
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.480]   There is a reference frame that we are picking
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.280]   in this Rullio space,
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.340]   and that that is what determines
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.000]   our perception of the universe.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.120]   With our particular sensory information and so on,
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.520]   we are parsing the universe in this particular way.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.080]   So here's the way to think about it.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.880]   In physical space,
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:27.300]   we live in a particular place in the universe.
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:29.240]   And we could live on Alpha Centauri,
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:30.600]   but we don't, we live here.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:34.480]   And similarly, in Rullio space,
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:37.520]   we could live in many different places in Rullio space,
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.240]   but we happen to live here.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.360]   And what does it mean to live here?
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:43.160]   It means we have certain sensory input.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.760]   We have certain ways to parse the universe.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.840]   Those are our interpretation of the universe.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.560]   What would it mean to travel in Rullio space?
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.920]   What it basically means is that we are successively
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:56.240]   interpreting the universe in different ways.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.160]   So in other words,
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.680]   to be at a different point in Rullio space
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:01.680]   is to have a different, in a sense,
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.520]   a different interpretation of what's going on
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.680]   in the universe.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.280]   And we can imagine even things like an analog
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:09.800]   of the speed of light as the maximum speed
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.560]   of translation in Rullio space and so on.
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:15.840]   - So wait, what's the interpretation?
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:19.680]   So Rullio space, and we, I'm confused by the we
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.400]   and the interpretation and the universe.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.040]   I thought moving about in Rullio space
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:29.040]   changes the way the universe is.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.280]   - The way we would perceive it.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.120]   The way that--
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.400]   - So it ultimately has to do with the perception.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:40.400]   So it doesn't, Rullio space is not somehow changing,
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:45.720]   like branching into another universe or something like that.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:48.560]   - No, I mean, the point is, the whole point of this
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:53.280]   is the Rulliard is sort of the encapsulated version
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.400]   of everything that is the universe
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.880]   running according to all possible rules.
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:59.240]   - We think of our universe,
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:03.320]   the observable universe as its thing.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:05.960]   So we're a little bit loose with the word universe then
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.760]   because wouldn't the Rulliard potentially encapsulate
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:14.040]   a very large number, like combinatorially large,
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.440]   maybe infinite set of what we human physicists
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.280]   think of as universes?
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.880]   - That's an interesting parsing of the word universe, right?
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.800]   Because what we're saying is,
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.960]   just as we're at a particular place in physical space,
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:30.640]   we're at a particular place in Rullio space,
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.760]   at that particular place in Rullio space,
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.960]   our experience of the universe is this.
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.960]   Just as if we lived at the center of the galaxy,
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.520]   our universe, our experience of the universe
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.320]   will be different from the one it is
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.000]   given where we actually live.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.280]   And so what we're saying is,
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.160]   what you might say,
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.000]   I mean, in a sense,
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.880]   this Rulliard is sort of a super universe, so to speak,
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:53.560]   but it's all entangled together.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.120]   It's not like you can separate out.
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:57.080]   You can say, let me,
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.480]   it's like when we take a reference, okay.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.000]   It's like our experience of the universe
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.400]   is based on where we are in the universe.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.800]   We could imagine moving to somewhere else in the universe,
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.120]   but it's still the same universe.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.960]   - So there's not like universes
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.280]   existing in parallel.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:14.200]   - No, no, because,
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.320]   because, and the whole point is that
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.240]   if we were able to change our interpretation
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:20.620]   of what's going on,
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:24.280]   we could perceive a different reference frame
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.280]   in this Rulliard.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.600]   - Yeah, but that's not,
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.680]   that's not, that's just, yeah,
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.600]   that's the same Rulliard,
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.480]   that's the same universe.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:34.000]   You're just moving about.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.840]   These are just coordinates in the universe.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:36.920]   - So the way that's,
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.840]   the reason that's interesting is,
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.920]   imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence,
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.460]   so the alien intelligence, we should say.
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:47.400]   The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri,
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:50.240]   but it might also live at a different place in Rullio space.
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:51.680]   - It can live right here on earth.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.400]   It just has a different reference frame
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.680]   that includes a very different perception of the universe.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.100]   And then because that Rullio space is very large,
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:02.940]   I mean,
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.620]   - Do we get to communicate with them?
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.460]   Right, that's.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:07.880]   - Yeah, but it's also,
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.840]   well, one thing is how different
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.840]   the perception of the universe could be.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.560]   - I think it could be bizarrely,
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.920]   unimaginably, completely different.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.880]   And I mean, one thing to realize is,
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:25.280]   even in kind of things I don't understand well,
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:28.280]   you know, I know about the kind of Western tradition
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.080]   of understanding, you know, science
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.320]   and all that kind of thing.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.040]   And, you know, you talk to people who say,
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:37.160]   well, I, you know, I'm really into some, you know,
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.560]   Eastern tradition of this, that, and the other.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.440]   And it's really obvious to me how things work.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.120]   I don't understand it at all, but, you know,
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.280]   it is not obvious, I think, with this kind of realization
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:50.440]   that there's these very different ways
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.760]   to interpret what's going on in the universe.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:54.160]   That kind of gives me at least,
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.600]   it doesn't help me to understand
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.120]   that different interpretation,
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:00.120]   but it gives me at least more respect for the possibility
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.520]   that there will be other interpretations.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:04.840]   - Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that like,
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.120]   what is it, reincarnation,
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.320]   or all these like eternal recurrence,
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:12.800]   when you share like just these ideas, yeah.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.160]   - Well, you know, the thing that I've realized
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.960]   about a bunch of those things is that, you know,
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.840]   I've been sort of doing my little survey
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:20.360]   of the history of philosophy, just trying to understand,
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.200]   you know, what can I actually say now
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.600]   about some of these things?
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.440]   And you realize that some of these concepts,
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:28.720]   like the immortal soul concept, which, you know,
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:31.080]   I remember when I was a kid and, you know,
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:34.240]   it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.240]   of people saying, you know, well, we know about physics,
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.920]   tell us how much does a soul weigh?
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:42.920]   And people are like, well, how can it be a thing
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.800]   if it doesn't weigh anything?
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.560]   Well, now we understand, you know,
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.600]   there is this notion of what's in brains
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.240]   that isn't the matter of brains
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.040]   and it's something computational.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.840]   And there is a sense, and in fact, it is correct,
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:56.400]   that it is in some sense immortal
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.600]   because this pattern of computation is something abstract
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:03.680]   that is not specific to the particular material of a brain.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.960]   Now, we don't know how to extract it, you know,
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:08.400]   in our traditional scientific approach,
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:11.840]   but it's still something where it isn't a crazy thing
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:14.520]   to say there is something, it doesn't weigh anything.
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:16.240]   That's a kind of a silly question.
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:18.160]   How much does it weigh?
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.360]   Well, actually, maybe it isn't such a silly question
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:21.360]   in our model of physics
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:24.240]   because the actual computational activity
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.520]   has a consequence for gravity and things,
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.880]   but that's a very subtle--
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:30.600]   - You can start talking about mass and energy and so on.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:34.080]   There could be a, what would you call it, a solitron.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.360]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.680]   - A particle that somehow contains soleness.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.520]   - Yeah, right.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:43.280]   Well, that's what, by the way, that's what Leibniz said.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.680]   And, you know, one thing, I've never understood this.
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:48.480]   You know, Leibniz had this idea of monads and monodology
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.200]   and he had this idea that what exists in the universe
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:53.200]   is this big collection of monads
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:56.560]   and that the only thing that one knows about the monads
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.320]   is sort of how they relate to each other,
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.640]   which sounds awfully like hypergraphs, right?
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:04.120]   But Leibniz had really lost me at the following thing.
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.880]   He said, "Each of these monads has a soul
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.240]   "and each of them has a consciousness."
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.640]   And it's like, okay, I'm out of here.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.160]   I don't understand this at all.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.000]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.240]   But I realized recently that in his day,
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.520]   the concept that a thing could do something,
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.640]   could spontaneously do something,
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:23.920]   that was his only way of describing that.
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.600]   And so what I would now say is,
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.160]   well, there's this abstract rule that runs
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:30.680]   to Leibniz that would have been, you know,
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:33.600]   in 1690 or whatever, that would have been kind of,
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.440]   well, it has a soul, it has a consciousness.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:39.100]   And so, you know, in a sense, it's like one of these,
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.440]   there's no new idea under the sun, so to speak.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:44.580]   That's a sort of a version of the same kinds of ideas,
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:48.480]   but couched in terms that are sort of bizarrely different
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.380]   from the ones that we would use today.
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:52.900]   - Would you be able to maybe play devil's advocate
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:55.120]   on your conception of consciousness,
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:58.040]   that like the two characteristics of it,
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.640]   that it's constrained and there's a single thread of time,
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:04.200]   is it possible that Leibniz was onto something
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:09.200]   that the basic atom, the screwed atom of space
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.760]   has a consciousness?
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:14.240]   So these are just words, right?
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:18.160]   But like, is there some sense where consciousness
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:21.760]   is much more fundamental than you're making it seem?
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.600]   - I don't know.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.200]   I mean, you know, I think--
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.360]   - Can you construct a world
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.440]   in which it is much more fundamental?
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.000]   - I think that, okay, so the question would be,
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.640]   is there a way to think about kind of,
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:36.240]   if we sort of parse the universe down
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:38.720]   at the level of atoms of space or something,
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.340]   could we say, well, so that's really a question
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.240]   of a different point of view,
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.560]   a different place in real space.
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:45.560]   We're asking, you're asking the question,
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.520]   could there be a civilization that exists?
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.600]   Could there be sort of conscious entities
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:54.920]   that exist at the level of atoms of space?
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.240]   And what would that be like?
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:58.000]   And I think that comes back to this question of,
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.080]   can we, you know, what's it like
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:01.160]   to be a cellular automaton type thing?
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:04.880]   I mean, it's, you know, I'm not yet there.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:06.160]   I don't know.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.460]   I mean, I think that this is a,
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:12.960]   and I don't even know yet quite how to think about this
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.720]   in the sense that I was considering, you know,
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.680]   I never write fiction, but I haven't written it
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.800]   since I was like 10 years old.
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.840]   And my fiction, I made one attempt,
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.320]   which I sent to some science fiction writer friends of mine,
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.240]   and they told me it was terrible.
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.720]   So, but--
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:26.880]   - This is a long time ago?
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.000]   - No, it was recently.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.480]   - Recently, and they said it was terrible.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:32.000]   That'd be interesting to see you write a short story
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.760]   based on what sounds like it's already inspiring
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.080]   short stories by, or stories--
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.800]   - Yeah, right. - By science fiction writers.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.400]   - But I think the interesting thing for me is,
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.520]   you know, in the what does it,
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:45.480]   what is it like to be a whatever?
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:46.920]   - Yeah. - How do you describe that?
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.240]   I mean, it's like, that's not a thing
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.640]   that you describe in mathematics,
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:51.920]   that what is it like to be such and such?
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:53.760]   - Well, see, to me, when you say,
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:56.360]   what is it like to be something,
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:01.160]   presumes that you're talking about a singular entity.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.760]   So-- - Yeah.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.760]   - Like, there's some kind of feeling of the entity,
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:10.840]   the stuff that's inside of it,
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.800]   and the stuff that's outside of it.
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:17.000]   And then that's when consciousness starts making sense.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.440]   But then, it seems like that could be generalizable.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.960]   If you take some subset of a cellular automata,
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:29.640]   you could start talking about what does that subset--
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:30.800]   - Maybe. - Feel.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.720]   But then you can, I think you could just take
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:35.280]   arbitrary numbers of subsets.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:38.840]   Like, to me, like, you and I,
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.880]   individually are consciousnesses,
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.600]   but you could also say the two of us together
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:45.720]   is a singular consciousness.
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.040]   - Maybe, maybe.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.120]   I'm not so sure about that.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.000]   I think that the single thread of time thing
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.480]   may be pretty important.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:53.480]   And that as soon as you start saying,
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.440]   there are two different threads of time,
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.800]   there are two different experiences,
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.400]   and then we have to say, how do they relate?
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.600]   How are they sort of entangled with each other?
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.200]   I mean, that may be a different story
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:06.360]   of a thing that isn't much like, you know,
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:07.480]   what are the ants?
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:08.960]   You know, what's it like to be an ant?
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:11.360]   You know, where there's a sort of more collective view
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.040]   of the world, so to speak.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:13.960]   I don't know.
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:18.960]   I think that, I mean, this is, you know,
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.000]   I don't really have a good, I mean,
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.360]   you know, my best thought is, you know,
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.000]   can we turn it into a human story?
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.440]   It's like the question of, you know,
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.920]   when we try and understand physics,
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.080]   can we turn that into something
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.360]   which is sort of a human understandable narrative?
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:35.320]   And now what's it like to be a such and such?
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.920]   You know, maybe the only medium in which we can describe
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:39.920]   that is something like fiction,
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.280]   where it's kind of like you're telling, you know,
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.440]   the life story in that setting.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:49.640]   But this is beyond what I've yet understood how to do.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.160]   - Yeah, but it does seem so, like with human consciousness,
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.000]   you know, we're made up of cells,
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.600]   and like there's a bunch of systems that are networked
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.520]   that work together that at the human level
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:06.760]   feel like a singular consciousness when you take.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:07.600]   - Yes.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.400]   - And so maybe like an ant colony is just too low level.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.960]   Sorry, an ant is too low level.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:16.000]   Maybe you have to look at the ant colony.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:16.840]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:20.160]   - There's some level at which it's a conscious being.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.600]   And then if you go to the planetary scale,
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.960]   then maybe that's going too far.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:26.840]   So there's a nice sweet spot for consciousness.
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.160]   - No, I agree.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:32.360]   I think the difficulty is that, you know, okay,
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.600]   so in sort of people who talk about consciousness,
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.560]   one of the terrible things I've realized,
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:40.120]   'cause I've now interacted with some of this community,
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:42.280]   so to speak, some interesting people
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.360]   who do that kind of thinking,
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:46.120]   but one of the things I was saying
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:48.160]   to one of the leading people in that area,
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:53.160]   I was saying that it must be kind of frustrating
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.640]   because it's kind of like a poetry story.
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:57.320]   That is, many people are writing poems,
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.800]   but few people are reading them.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:57:59.640]   - Yes.
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.000]   - So there are always these different,
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.360]   everybody has their own theory of consciousness,
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:08.200]   and they are very non-interdiscussable.
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.440]   And by the way, I mean, my own approach
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:13.720]   to sort of the question of consciousness,
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.600]   as far as I'm concerned,
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.200]   I'm an applied consciousness operative, so to speak,
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:19.640]   because I don't really, in a sense,
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:21.360]   the thing I'm trying to get out of it
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:23.400]   is how does it help me to understand
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:25.520]   what's a possible theory of physics?
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:27.720]   And how does it help me to say,
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:30.880]   how do I go from this incoherent collection
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.720]   of things happening in the universe
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:35.760]   to our definite perception and definite laws and so on,
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.320]   and sort of an applied version of consciousness?
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.840]   And I think the reason it sort of segues
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:41.840]   to a different kind of topic,
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:44.360]   but the reason that one of the things
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:45.480]   I'm particularly interested in
[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:48.040]   is kind of what's the analog of consciousness
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.600]   in systems very different from brains?
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.600]   And so why does that matter?
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:55.720]   Well, this whole description of this kind of,
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:57.640]   well, actually, you know what?
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:59.440]   We haven't talked about why the universe exists,
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:01.360]   so let's get to why the universe exists,
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:05.440]   and then we can talk about, perhaps a little bit about
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:09.040]   what these models of physics kind of show you
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.320]   about other kinds of things
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.120]   like molecular computing and so on.
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:13.280]   - Yes, that's good. - Okay,
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:14.840]   why does the universe exist?
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:17.240]   Okay, so we finally sort of more or less set the stage.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:19.400]   We've got this idea of this Rouliad,
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.040]   of this object that is made
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.960]   from following all possible rules,
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.400]   the fact that it's sort of not just this incoherent mess,
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:29.520]   it's got all this entangled structure in it, and so on.
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:32.600]   Okay, so what is this Rouliad?
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:37.520]   Well, it is the working out of all possible formal systems.
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:41.080]   So the sort of the question of why does the universe exist,
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:43.360]   its core question, which we kind of started with,
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:45.680]   is you've got two plus two equals four,
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:48.760]   you've got some other abstract result,
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:52.680]   but that's not actualized, it's just an abstract thing.
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:54.400]   And when we say we've got a model for the universe,
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.280]   okay, it's this rule, you run it,
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:58.200]   and it'll make the universe, but it's like,
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:01.400]   but where's it actually running?
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:04.560]   What is it actually doing, right?
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.720]   What, is it actual,
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:09.720]   or is it merely a formal description of something?
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:13.240]   Okay, so the thing to realize with this,
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:16.520]   the thing about the Rouliad is it's an inevitable,
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:21.240]   it is the entangled running of all possible rules.
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:24.280]   So you don't get to say, it's not like you're saying,
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.160]   which Rouliad are you picking?
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.640]   Because it's all possible formal rules.
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:31.520]   It's not like it's just, you know,
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:33.760]   well, actually it's only footnote,
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.560]   the only footnote, it's an important footnote,
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.960]   is it's all possible computational rules,
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.160]   not hyper computational rules.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:44.640]   That is, it's running all the rules
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:48.600]   that would be accessible to a Turing machine,
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.640]   but it is not running all the rules
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:52.160]   that will be accessible to a thing
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:54.720]   that can solve problems in finite time
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.280]   that would take a Turing machine infinite time to solve.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.280]   So you can, even Alan Turing knew this,
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.640]   that you could make oracles for Turing machines,
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:03.640]   where you say a Turing machine can't solve
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:05.200]   a halting problem for Turing machines.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:07.680]   It can't know what will happen in any Turing machine
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:10.120]   after an infinite time, in any finite time,
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.240]   but you could invent a box, just make a black box.
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.760]   You say, I'm gonna sell you an oracle
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:18.120]   that will just tell you, you know, press this button,
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:19.400]   it'll tell you what the Turing machine
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.800]   will do after an infinite time.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:22.880]   You can imagine such a box.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:24.860]   You can't necessarily build one in the physical universe,
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:26.800]   but you can imagine such a box.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:29.160]   And so we could say, well, in addition to,
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:32.080]   so in this Rouliad, we're imagining
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:35.600]   that there is a computational, that at the end,
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:37.920]   it's running rules that are computational.
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.240]   It doesn't have a bunch of oracle black boxes in it.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.020]   You say, well, why not?
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:47.240]   Well, it turns out if there are oracle black boxes,
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.680]   the Rouliad that is, you can make a sort of super Rouliad
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:53.220]   that contains those oracle black boxes,
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:55.440]   but it has a cosmological event horizon
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:58.160]   relative to the first one, they can't communicate.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.720]   In other words, you can end up with,
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:03.320]   what you end up happening, what ends up happening
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.000]   is it's like in the physical universe,
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.960]   we in this causal graph that represents
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:10.080]   the causal relationships of different things,
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.720]   you can have an event horizon,
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:14.760]   where the causal graph is disconnected,
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:17.640]   where the effect here, an event happening here
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.800]   does not affect an event happening here
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:22.000]   because there's a disconnection in the causal graph.
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.200]   And that's what happens in an event horizon.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:27.120]   And so what will happen between this kind of
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:30.320]   the ordinary Rouliad and the hyper Rouliad
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:35.320]   is there is an event horizon and we in our Rouliad
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:39.480]   will just never know that there is,
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.080]   that they're just separate things, they're not connected.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:44.400]   - Maybe I'm not understanding,
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.300]   but just because we can't observe it,
[02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:49.620]   why does that mean it doesn't exist?
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:54.400]   - It might exist, but it's not clear what it,
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.160]   so what, so to speak, whether it exists.
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.280]   What we're trying to understand
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:00.760]   is why does our universe exist?
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.600]   We're not trying to ask the question,
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:06.480]   what, you know, it's, let me say another thing,
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.960]   let me make a meta comment, okay?
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:11.280]   Which is that I have not thought through
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.200]   this hyper Rouliad business properly.
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.440]   So I can't, the--
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:20.720]   - The hyper Rouliad is referring to a Rouliad
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:22.760]   in which hyper computation is possible.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:24.320]   - That's correct, yes.
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.120]   - So like what, that footnote,
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:29.640]   the footnote to the footnote is,
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:33.340]   we're not sure why this is important.
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:34.260]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:36.660]   So let's ignore that, okay?
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:38.960]   It's already abstract enough, okay?
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.120]   So, okay, so the one question is,
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.080]   we have to say, if we're saying,
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.880]   why does the universe exist?
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.800]   One question is, why is it this universe
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:51.000]   and not another universe, okay?
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.240]   So the important point about this Rouliad idea
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:59.160]   is that it's, in the Rouliad are all possible formal systems.
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:01.120]   So there's no choice being made.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:04.240]   There's no like, oh, we pick this particular universe
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:05.280]   and not that one.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.280]   That's the first thing.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.000]   The second thing is that we have to ask the question.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.000]   So you say, why does two plus two equals four exist?
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.200]   That's not really a, that is a thing
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.840]   that necessarily is that way,
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:21.880]   just on the basis of the meaning of the terms,
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:24.980]   two and plus and equals and so on, right?
[02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:28.340]   So the thing is that this Rouliad object
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:30.920]   is in a sense a necessary object.
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.400]   It is just a thing that is the consequence
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.900]   of working out the consequence
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:38.120]   of the formal definition of things.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.560]   You don't, it is not a thing where you're saying,
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:43.680]   and this is picked as the particular thing.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:47.840]   This is just something which necessarily is that thing
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:49.160]   because of the definition
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.920]   of what it means to have computation.
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:54.560]   - So the Rouliad, it's a formal system.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:55.400]   - Yes.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:58.800]   - But does it exist?
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:03.480]   - Ah, well, where are we in this whole thing?
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.680]   We are part of this Rouliad.
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:09.960]   And so our, so there is no sense to say,
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:13.240]   does two plus two equals four exist?
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:18.120]   Well, that's, in some sense, it necessarily exists.
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.520]   It's a necessary object.
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.840]   It's not a thing that where you can ask.
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:26.080]   Usually in philosophy, there's a sort of distinction made
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:29.920]   between necessary truths, contingent truths,
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:32.160]   analytic propositions, synthetic propositions,
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.320]   there are a variety of different versions of this.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.960]   There are things which are necessarily true
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:39.600]   just based on the definition of terms.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:42.880]   And there are things which happen to be true in our universe.
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.800]   - But we don't exist in Roulial space.
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:50.280]   That's one of the coordinates that define our existence.
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:53.440]   - Well, okay, so yes, yes.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:56.120]   But this Rouliad is the set
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:58.400]   of all possible Roulial coordinates.
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:01.120]   So what we're saying is it contains that.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.520]   So what we're saying is we exist as, okay,
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:06.760]   so our perception of what's going on
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:09.400]   is we're at a particular place in this Rouliad,
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:11.060]   and we are concluding certain things
[02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:13.700]   about how the universe works based on that.
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:17.760]   But the question is, do we understand,
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.640]   is there something where we say,
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:23.520]   so why does it work that way?
[02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:27.480]   Well, the answer is, I think it has to work that way
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:32.480]   because this Rouliad is a necessary object
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:35.520]   in the sense that it is a purely formal object,
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.500]   just like two plus two equals four.
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:40.740]   It's not an object that was made of something.
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:43.040]   It's an object that is just an expression
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:47.280]   of the necessary collection of formal relations that exist.
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:52.280]   And so then the issue is, can we, in our experience of that,
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:56.200]   is it, can we have tables and chairs, so to speak,
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:59.540]   in that just by virtue of our experience
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:01.560]   of that necessary thing?
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.640]   And what people have generally thought,
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.800]   and honestly, I don't know of a lot of discussion of this
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:09.720]   why does the universe exist question.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:12.920]   It's been a very, I've been surprised, actually,
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:15.520]   at how little, I mean, I think it's one of these things
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:18.440]   that's really kind of far out there.
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:22.800]   But the thing that is, the surprise here
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:26.080]   is that all possible formal rules,
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:29.120]   when you run them together, and that's the critical thing,
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:30.080]   when you run them together,
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.880]   they produce this kind of entangled structure
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.920]   that has a definite structure.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:38.040]   It's not just a random arbitrary thing.
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:40.040]   It's a thing with definite structure.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.360]   And that structure is the thing,
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:44.440]   when we are embedded in that structure,
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:48.800]   when an entity embedded in that structure
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.400]   perceives something which is,
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:54.600]   then we can interpret as physics and things like this.
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:57.200]   So in other words, we don't have to ask the question,
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.740]   why does it exist?
[02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:01.320]   It necessarily exists.
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:02.320]   - I'm missing this part.
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:04.240]   Why does it necessarily exist?
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:05.080]   - Okay, let me try.
[02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:09.220]   - So like you need to have it if you want to formalize
[02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:11.540]   the relation between entities,
[02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:15.880]   but why do you need to have relations?
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:16.720]   - Okay, okay.
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:20.960]   So let's say you say, well-
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:25.800]   - It's like, why does math have to exist?
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.520]   - Okay, fair question.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:29.000]   Yeah, okay, fair question.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.180]   Let's see.
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:33.680]   I think the thing to think about is
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.880]   the existence of mathematics is something where,
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:39.080]   given a definition of terms,
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:44.480]   what follows from that definition inevitably follows.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:48.480]   So now you can say, why define any terms?
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:53.120]   But in a sense, the, well, that's okay.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.880]   So the definition of terms, I mean,
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:58.960]   I think the way to think about this, let me see.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:02.320]   - So like concrete terms.
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.400]   - Well, not very concrete.
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.600]   I mean, they're just things like, you know,
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:10.480]   logical or.
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:12.800]   - Right, but that's a thing.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.080]   That's a powerful thing.
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.720]   - Well, it's a, yes, okay.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:19.200]   But it's a, the point is that it is not a thing of a,
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:22.760]   you know, people imagine there is, I don't know,
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:25.800]   the, you know, an elephant or something,
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:29.100]   or the, you know, elephants are presumably
[02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:31.280]   not necessary objects.
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.240]   They are, they happen to exist as a result of
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:37.080]   kind of biological evolution and whatever else.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:41.360]   But the thing is that in some sense,
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:44.320]   that there is, it is a different kind of thing
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.760]   to say does plus exist.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:49.640]   It is not like an elephant.
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:51.880]   - So a plus is, seems more fundamental,
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:54.200]   more basic than an elephant, yes.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.800]   But you can imagine a world without plus
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.880]   or anything like it.
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.800]   Like why do formal things that are discrete,
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:09.480]   that can be used to reason have to exist?
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:12.880]   - Well, okay, so why, okay, so then the question is,
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:15.560]   but the whole point is computation,
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:18.500]   we can certainly imagine computation.
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:21.560]   That is, we can certainly say there is a formal system
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:24.880]   that we can construct abstractly in our minds
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:26.820]   that is computation.
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:31.820]   And that's the, you know, we can imagine it, right?
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.120]   Now the question is, is it is that formal system,
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:41.720]   once we exist as observers embedded in that formal system,
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:45.560]   that's enough to have something which is like our universe.
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:49.720]   And so then what you're kind of asking is perhaps,
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.360]   is why, I mean, the point is we definitely can imagine it.
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:56.120]   There's nothing that says that,
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:59.000]   we're not saying that there's,
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.400]   it's sort of inevitable that that is a thing
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:04.240]   that we can imagine.
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:06.600]   We don't have to ask, does it exist?
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.400]   We're just, it is definitely something we can imagine.
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:12.520]   Now that's, then we have this thing
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:16.940]   that is a formally constructible thing that we can imagine.
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:18.840]   And now we have to ask the question,
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:22.880]   what, you know, given that formally constructible thing,
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:25.920]   what is, what consequences does that,
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:28.640]   if we were to perceive that formally,
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:31.840]   if we were embedded in that formally constructible thing,
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:33.840]   what would we perceive about the world?
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:38.480]   And we would say, we perceive that the world exists
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.080]   because we are seeing all of this mechanism
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:42.600]   of all these things happening.
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:46.080]   And, but that's something that is just a feature of,
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.600]   it's something where we are--
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.800]   - See another way of asking this,
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.800]   that I'm trying to get at,
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.280]   I understand why it feels like this Rouliad
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.480]   is necessary,
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:03.740]   but maybe it's just me being human,
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:07.560]   but it feels like then you should be able to,
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:11.640]   not us, but somehow step outside of the Rouliad.
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:14.200]   Like what's outside the Rouliad?
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.920]   - Well, the Rouliad is all formal systems.
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:18.600]   So there's nothing because--
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:20.480]   - But that's what a human would say.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:21.760]   - I know that's what a human would say
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:24.660]   'cause we're used to the idea that there's,
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:26.040]   but the whole point is that
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:28.860]   by the time it's all possible formal systems,
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:34.520]   it's like, it is all things you can imagine, but--
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:37.160]   - Not all computations you can imagine,
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.140]   but like we don't--
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:41.480]   - Well, so the issue is can we encode?
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:44.240]   Okay, so that's a fair question.
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:47.960]   Is it possible to encode all,
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:50.000]   I mean, once we,
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.760]   is there something that isn't
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:53.480]   what we can represent formally?
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:54.320]   - Right.
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.320]   - That is, is there something that,
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:59.520]   and that's I think related to the hyper-Rouliad footnote,
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.360]   so to speak, of which I'm afraid that the,
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:07.440]   one of the things sort of interesting about this is,
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.880]   there has been some discussion of this in theology
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:11.680]   and things like that,
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.480]   but which I don't necessarily understand all of,
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:20.480]   but the key sort of new input is this idea
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.080]   that all possible formal systems,
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:25.920]   it's like, if you make a world,
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:27.880]   people say, well, you make a world
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:30.040]   with a particular, in a particular way,
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:32.560]   with particular rules, but no, you don't do that.
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:35.840]   You can make a world that deals with all possible rules
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:40.760]   and then merely by virtue of living in a particular place
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.440]   in that world, so to speak,
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:45.620]   we have the perception we have of what the world is like.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:46.880]   Now, I have to say,
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:50.520]   it's sort of interesting 'cause I've,
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:51.840]   I wrote this piece about this
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:56.120]   and I, this philosophy stuff is not super easy
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:59.720]   and I've, as I'm talking to you about it
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:01.280]   and I actually haven't,
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:02.840]   people have been interested in lots of different things
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:05.240]   we've been doing, but this, why does the universe exist,
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:08.080]   has been, I would say, one of the ones
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:11.040]   that you would think people would be most interested in,
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.400]   but actually, I think they're just like,
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:16.560]   oh, that's just something complicated that,
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:19.880]   so I haven't explained it as much
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:21.240]   as I've explained a bunch of other things
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.640]   and I have to say, I think I may be missing
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.800]   a couple of pieces of that argument that would be,
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:29.520]   so it's kind of like--
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.840]   - Well, you're conscious being is computationally bounded,
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:34.960]   so you're missing-- - Indeed.
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:38.160]   - Having written quite a few articles yourself,
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:40.520]   you're now missing some of the pieces.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:41.840]   - Yes, well, it's always-- - That's the limitation
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:42.680]   of being human.
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:44.900]   - Right, one of the consequences of this,
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:48.520]   why the universe exists thing and this kind of concept
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:53.320]   of Rouillades and places in there representing
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.360]   our perception of the universe and so on,
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:57.760]   one of the weird consequences is,
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:01.380]   if the universe exists, mathematics must also exist.
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:05.140]   And that's a weird thing because mathematics,
[02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:07.360]   people have been very confused, including me,
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.640]   have been very confused about the question
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:15.480]   of kind of what is the foundation of mathematics?
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:17.600]   What is, what kind of a thing is mathematics?
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:21.680]   Is mathematics something where we just write down axioms
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:24.920]   like Euclid did for geometry and we just build the structure
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:26.520]   and we could have written down different axioms
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:28.200]   and we'd have a different structure?
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:30.600]   Or is it something that has a more fundamental
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:32.000]   sort of truth to it?
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.040]   And I have to say, it's one of these cases where
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:37.000]   I've long believed that mathematics has a great deal
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.840]   of arbitrariness to it, that there are particular axioms
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:42.420]   that kind of got written down by the Babylonians
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:45.080]   and that's what we've ended up with the mathematics
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.000]   that we have.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.400]   And I have to say, actually, my wife has been telling me
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:50.480]   for 25 years, she's a mathematician,
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:52.680]   she's been telling me, "You're wrong about the foundations
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:53.520]   "of mathematics."
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.740]   And I'm like, "No, no, no, I know what I'm talking about."
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:02.120]   And finally, she's much more right than I've been.
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.880]   So it's one of the--
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:08.560]   - So I mean, her sense and your sense, are we just,
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.280]   so this is to the question of mathematics,
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.920]   are we just kind of on a trajectory through
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:17.000]   ruleal space except in mathematics,
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.320]   is there a trajectory, a certain kind of--
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:21.080]   - I think that's partly the idea.
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:22.800]   So I think that the notion is this.
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.200]   So 100 years ago, a little bit more than 100 years ago,
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.200]   well, people have been doing mathematics for ages,
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:31.160]   but then in the late 1800s, people decided to try
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:33.800]   and formalize mathematics and say,
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.320]   mathematics is, we're gonna break it down,
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:39.200]   we're gonna make it like logic, we're gonna make it
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:42.020]   out of sort of fundamental primitives.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:44.120]   And that was people like Frege and Piano and Hilbert
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:47.680]   and so on, and they kind of got this idea of,
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:50.280]   let's do kind of Euclid, but even better,
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:52.600]   let's just make everything just in terms of this sort of
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.300]   symbolic axioms, and then build up mathematics from that.
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:59.420]   And that, they thought at the time,
[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:02.320]   as soon as they get these symbolic axioms,
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:03.800]   that they made the same mistake,
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:06.240]   the kind of computational irreducibility mistake.
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:09.440]   They thought as soon as we've written down the axioms,
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:11.640]   then it'll just, we'll just have a machine,
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:13.960]   kind of a super Mathematica, so to speak,
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:17.760]   that can just grind out all true theorems of mathematics.
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:20.000]   That got exploded by Godel's theorem,
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.280]   which is basically the story
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:23.120]   of computational irreducibility.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.880]   It's that even though you know those underlying rules,
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:29.680]   you can't deduce all the consequences in any finite way.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.040]   And so that was, but now the question is,
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.600]   okay, so they broke mathematics down into these axioms,
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:37.800]   and they say, now you build up from that.
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:41.460]   So what I'm increasingly coming to realize is,
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:44.260]   that's similar to saying, let's take a gas
[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:46.340]   and break it down into molecules.
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:49.500]   There's gas laws that are the large scale structure
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:52.060]   and so on that we humans are familiar with,
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:54.740]   and then there's the underlying molecular dynamics.
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:57.640]   And I think that the axiomatic level of mathematics,
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:00.180]   which we can access with automated theorem proving
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:02.820]   and proof assistance and these kinds of things,
[02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:05.340]   that's the molecular dynamics of mathematics.
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:08.700]   And occasionally we see through to that molecular dynamics.
[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:11.300]   We see undecidability, we see other things like this.
[02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:13.820]   One of the things I've always found very mysterious
[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:18.220]   is that Godel's theorem shows that there are sort of things
[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:20.420]   which cannot be finitely proved in mathematics.
[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:22.200]   There are proofs of arbitrary length,
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:24.500]   infinite length proofs that you might need.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:26.060]   But in practical mathematics,
[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:28.300]   mathematicians don't typically run into this.
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:31.420]   They just happily go along doing their mathematics.
[02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:33.580]   And I think what's actually happening is that
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:36.600]   what they're doing is they're looking at this,
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:41.600]   they are essentially observers in meta-mathematical space,
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:43.900]   and they are picking a reference frame
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:45.600]   in meta-mathematical space,
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:47.720]   and they are computationally bounded observers
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:49.340]   of meta-mathematical space,
[02:18:49.340 --> 02:18:52.000]   which is causing them to deduce
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.120]   that the laws of meta-mathematics
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:55.680]   and the laws of mathematics,
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:57.380]   like the laws of fluid mechanics,
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:59.240]   are much more understandable
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.840]   than this underlying molecular dynamics.
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:05.240]   And so what gets really bizarre is thinking about
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:08.660]   kind of the analogy between meta-mathematics,
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:11.780]   this idea of you exist in this kind of,
[02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:16.040]   in this sort of space of possible,
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:17.920]   in this kind of mathematical space
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:20.960]   where the individual kind of points
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:24.160]   in the mathematical space are statements in mathematics,
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.200]   and they're connected by proofs,
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:27.440]   where one statement, you know,
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:29.040]   you take a couple of different statements,
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:31.160]   you can use those to prove some other statement,
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:33.600]   and you've got this whole network of proofs.
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:35.920]   That's the kind of causal network of mathematics,
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:38.120]   of what can prove what, and so on.
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:40.320]   And you can say at any moment
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:42.940]   in the history of a mathematician,
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:45.280]   of a single mathematical consciousness,
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:48.520]   you are in a single kind of slice
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:51.280]   of this kind of meta-mathematical space.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:54.160]   You know a certain set of mathematical statements.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.920]   You can then deduce with proofs,
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:57.820]   you can deduce other ones, and so on.
[02:19:57.820 --> 02:19:59.180]   You're kind of gradually moving
[02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:01.160]   through meta-mathematical space.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:03.520]   And so it's kind of the view is
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:07.000]   that the reason that mathematicians perceive mathematics
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.680]   to have the sort of integrity
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:11.580]   and lack of kind of undecidability and so on that they do,
[02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:14.200]   is because they, like we as observers
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:15.520]   of the physical universe,
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.320]   we have these limitations associated
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:20.040]   with computational boundedness, single thread of time,
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:22.240]   consciousness limitations, basically,
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:24.600]   that the same thing is true of mathematicians
[02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:26.440]   perceiving sort of meta-mathematical space.
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:29.160]   And so what's happening is that when you look at,
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:32.080]   if you look at one of these formalized mathematics systems,
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:34.400]   something like Pythagoras' theorem,
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:38.320]   it'll be, it'll take, oh, I don't know, what is it?
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:41.400]   Maybe 10,000 individual little steps
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:43.240]   to prove Pythagoras' theorem.
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:45.200]   And one of the bizarre things,
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:46.920]   that's sort of an empirical fact
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:48.640]   that I'm trying to understand a little bit better,
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:50.240]   if you look at different proof,
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:52.800]   if you look at different formalized mathematics systems,
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:55.120]   they actually have different axioms underneath,
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:57.360]   but they can all prove Pythagoras' theorem.
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:58.680]   And so, in other words,
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:01.080]   it's a little bit like what happens with gases.
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:03.440]   We can have air molecules, we can have water molecules,
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:05.080]   but they still have fluid dynamics.
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.800]   Both of them have fluid dynamics.
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:09.440]   And so similarly, at the level that mathematics,
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:11.760]   that mathematicians care about mathematics,
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:14.680]   it's way above the molecular dynamics, so to speak.
[02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:16.280]   And there are all kinds of weird things,
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:18.280]   like for example, one thing I was realizing recently
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:20.480]   is that the quantum theory of mathematics,
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:22.200]   that's a very bizarre idea.
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:25.720]   But basically, when you prove what is, you know,
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:29.120]   a proof is you've got one statement in mathematics,
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:30.200]   you go through other statements,
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:31.560]   you eventually get to a statement
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:33.080]   you're trying to prove, for example,
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:36.620]   that's a path in metamathematical space.
[02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:39.900]   And that's a single path, a single proof is a single path.
[02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:41.960]   But you can imagine there are other proofs
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:43.520]   of the same result.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:45.160]   There are a bundle of proofs.
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:47.480]   There's this whole set of possible proofs.
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:48.720]   - You could think of it as branching,
[02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:50.320]   similar to the quantum mechanics model
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:51.160]   that you were talking about.
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:52.000]   - Exactly, and so-
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.600]   - And then there's some invariance that you can formalize
[02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:56.880]   in the same way that you can for the quantum mechanical.
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:59.240]   - Right, so the question is in proof space,
[02:21:59.240 --> 02:22:01.720]   you know, as you start thinking about multiple proofs,
[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:03.000]   are there analogs of, for example,
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.440]   destructive interference of multiple proofs?
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:08.360]   So here's a bizarre idea, it's just a couple of days old,
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:10.640]   so not yet fully formed.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:12.640]   But as you try and do that,
[02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:14.480]   when you have two different proofs,
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:16.360]   it's like two photons going in different directions.
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:19.040]   You have two proofs which at an intermediate stage
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:20.400]   are incompatible.
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.160]   And that's kind of like destructive interference.
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:25.720]   - Is it possible for this to instruct the engineering
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:28.080]   of automated proof systems?
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:29.840]   - Absolutely, I mean, as a practical matter,
[02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:32.040]   I mean, you know, this whole question,
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:34.440]   in fact, Jonathan Gorad has a nice heuristic
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:35.960]   for automated theorem provers
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:37.880]   that's based on our physics project
[02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:42.280]   that is looking for essentially using kind of,
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:44.920]   using energy, in our models,
[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:49.400]   energy is kind of level of activity in this hypergraph.
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:51.200]   And so there's sort of a heuristic
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.800]   for automated theorem proving
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.120]   about how do you pick which path to go down
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:59.800]   that is based on essentially physics.
[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:02.440]   And I mean, the thing that gets interesting about this
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.920]   is the way that one can sort of have the interplay
[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:06.720]   between like, for example, a black hole.
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:09.160]   What is a black hole in mathematics?
[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:11.800]   So the answer is, what is a black hole in physics?
[02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:14.160]   A black hole in physics is where,
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:16.960]   in the simplest form of black hole, time ends.
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:20.000]   That is all, you know, everything is crunched down
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.720]   to the space-time singularity
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:24.600]   and everything just ends up at that singularity.
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:27.440]   So in our models, and that's a little hard to understand
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.640]   in general relativity with continuous mathematics
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:31.400]   and what does singularity look like.
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:33.280]   In our models, it's something very pragmatic.
[02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:35.080]   It's just, you're applying these rules,
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:36.520]   time is moving forward,
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:38.320]   and then there comes a moment where the rules,
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:41.000]   no rules apply, so time stops.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.800]   It's kind of like the universe dies.
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:45.880]   There's, you know, nothing happens in the universe anymore.
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:49.360]   Well, in mathematics, that's a decidable theory.
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:52.800]   That's a theory, so theories which have undecidability,
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:54.720]   which are things like arithmetic, set theory,
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:57.560]   all the serious models, theories in mathematics,
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:59.360]   they all have the feature that there are proofs
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.440]   of arbitrary long length.
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:03.200]   In something like Boolean algebra,
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:04.880]   which is a decidable theory,
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:07.320]   there are, you know, any question in Boolean algebra,
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:08.880]   you can just go crunch, crunch, crunch,
[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:11.880]   and in a known number of steps, you can answer it.
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:14.800]   You know, satisfiability, you know, might be hard,
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:16.560]   but it's still a bounded number of steps
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:18.600]   to answer any satisfiability problem.
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:22.320]   And so that's the notion of a black hole in physics
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.000]   where time stops.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.400]   That's analogous to in mathematics
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:29.720]   where there aren't infinite length proofs.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:32.240]   Where when in physics, you know,
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:34.280]   you can wander around the universe forever
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:35.440]   if you don't run into a black hole.
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:38.680]   If you run into a black hole and time stops, you're done.
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:40.360]   And it's the same thing in mathematics
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:43.120]   between decidable theories and undecidable theories.
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:46.520]   So it's an example, and I think we're sort of,
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:49.600]   the attempt to understand, so another question is kind of,
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.560]   what is the generativity of metamathematics?
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.400]   What is the bulk theory of metamathematics?
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:59.240]   So in the literature of mathematics,
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:00.480]   there are about 3 million theorems
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:02.520]   that people have published.
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:04.960]   And those represent, it's kind of on this,
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.240]   it's like on the earth, we would be, you know,
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:11.960]   we've put cities in particular places on the earth,
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:13.480]   but yet there is ultimately, you know,
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:15.640]   we know the earth is roughly spherical
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.160]   and there's an underlying space.
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.440]   And we could just talk about, you know,
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:21.880]   the world of space in terms of where our cities
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:24.480]   happen to be, but there's actually an underlying space.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:27.000]   And so the question is, what's that for metamathematics?
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.520]   And as we kind of explore what is, for example,
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:32.040]   for mathematics, which is always likes taking
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:33.680]   sort of abstract limits.
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:36.360]   So an obvious abstract limit for mathematics to take
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.960]   is the limit of the future of mathematics.
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:40.920]   That is, what will be, you know,
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:43.280]   the ultimate structure of mathematics?
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:45.200]   And one of the things that's an empirical observation
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:47.640]   about mathematics that's quite interesting
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:50.600]   is that a lot of theories in one area of mathematics,
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.200]   algebraic geometry or something, might have,
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.840]   they play into another area of mathematics.
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.160]   That same kind of a fundamental construct
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:02.320]   seem to occur in very different areas of mathematics.
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:03.880]   And that's structurally captured a bit
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:05.900]   with category theory and things like that.
[02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:08.240]   But I think that there's probably an understanding
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:11.080]   of this metamathematical space that will explain
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:12.600]   why different areas of mathematics
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:15.360]   ultimately sort of map into the same thing.
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:17.840]   And I mean, you know, my little challenge to myself
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:22.120]   is what's time dilation in metamathematics?
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:24.320]   In other words, as you basically,
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:26.560]   as you move around in this mathematical space
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:29.360]   of possible statements, you know,
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.480]   what's, how does that moving around?
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:34.040]   It's basically what's happening is that
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:36.400]   as you move around in the space of mathematical statements,
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.400]   it's like you're changing from algebra to geometry
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:39.640]   to whatever else.
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:42.220]   And you're trying to prove the same theorem.
[02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:44.440]   But as you try, if you keep on moving
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:45.960]   to these different places,
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:47.400]   it's slower to prove that theorem
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:49.660]   'cause you keep on having to translate what you're doing
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:50.640]   back to where you started from.
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:52.320]   And that's kind of the beginnings of the analog
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:54.800]   of time dilation in metamathematics.
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:56.680]   - Plus there's probably fractional dimensions
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:58.160]   in this space as well.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:00.600]   - Oh, this space is a very messy space.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:02.840]   This space is much messier than physical space.
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:05.640]   I mean, even in the models of physics,
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:08.000]   physical space is very tame
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.920]   compared to branchial space and ruleal space.
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:13.000]   I mean, the mathematical structure, you know,
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.040]   branchial space is probably more like Hilbert space,
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:17.320]   but it's a rather complicated Hilbert space.
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:21.880]   And ruleal space is more like this weird
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:24.240]   infinity groupoid story of growth and decay.
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:25.600]   And I can explain that a little bit
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.840]   because in metamathematical space,
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.600]   a path in metamathematical space
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:35.120]   is a path between two statements
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:37.280]   is a way to get by proofs,
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:38.900]   is a way to find a proof
[02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:41.000]   that goes from one statement to another.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.760]   And so one of the things you can do,
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:44.160]   you can think about is you've got,
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:46.400]   between statements, you've got proofs.
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.280]   They are paths between statements.
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:50.440]   Okay, so now you can go to the next level
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:51.480]   and you can ask,
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:54.400]   what about a mapping from one proof to another?
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.560]   And so that's in category theory,
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.560]   that's kind of a higher category,
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:00.080]   a notion of higher categories
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:04.240]   where you're mapping not just between objects,
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:05.680]   but you're mapping between the mappings
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:07.480]   between objects and so on.
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:09.160]   And so you can keep doing that.
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:10.960]   You can keep saying higher order proofs.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:14.160]   I want mappings between proofs between proofs and so on.
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.400]   And that limiting structure,
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:16.280]   oh, by the way,
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:18.640]   one thing that's very interesting is
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:19.720]   imagine in proof space,
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:21.360]   you've got these two proofs.
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:22.320]   And the question is,
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:24.600]   what is the topology of proof space?
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:26.640]   In other words, if you take these two paths,
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.220]   can you continuously deform them into each other?
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:31.000]   Or is there some big hole in the middle
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.300]   that prevents you from continuously deforming them
[02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:34.280]   one into the other?
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:35.120]   It's kind of like,
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:36.760]   when you think about some,
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:38.440]   I don't know, some puzzle, for example,
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:40.960]   you're moving pieces around on some puzzle,
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:42.320]   and you can think about the space
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.160]   of possible states of the puzzle,
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.040]   and you can make this graph that shows
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:47.180]   from one state of the puzzle
[02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:49.040]   to another state of the puzzle and so on.
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:51.160]   And sometimes you can easily get
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:52.520]   from one state to any other state,
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:55.480]   but sometimes there'll be a hole in that space.
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:56.320]   And there'll be,
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:58.920]   you always have to go around the circuitous route
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:00.000]   to get from here to there.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.840]   There won't be any direct way.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:03.360]   That's kind of a question
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.760]   of whether there's sort of an obstruction in the space.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:09.180]   And so the question is, in proof space,
[02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:11.920]   what is the, what are,
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:14.760]   what does it mean if there's an obstruction in proof space?
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:17.360]   - Yeah, I don't even know what an obstruction means
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:18.200]   in proof space,
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:20.240]   'cause for it to be an obstruction,
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.040]   it should be reachable some other way
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:24.320]   from some other place, right?
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:27.720]   So this is like an unreachable part of the graph.
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:29.320]   - No, it's not just an unreachable part.
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:32.080]   It's a part where there are paths that go one way,
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:33.720]   there are paths that go the other way.
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:35.600]   And this question of homotopy and mathematics
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:38.400]   is this question, can you continuously deform,
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:40.400]   from one path to another path,
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.600]   or do you have to go in a jump, so to speak?
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:45.120]   So if you're going around a sphere, for example,
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:47.200]   if you're going around, I don't know,
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:50.200]   a cylinder or something, you can wind around one way
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:51.840]   and you can, there's no,
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:55.080]   there are paths where you can easily deform one path
[02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:56.560]   into another, because it's just sort of sitting
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:58.120]   on the same side of the cylinder.
[02:29:58.120 --> 02:29:59.120]   But when you've got something
[02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:00.560]   that winds all the way around a cylinder,
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:03.400]   you can't continuously deform that down to a point
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:05.520]   because it's stuck, wrapped around a cylinder.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.080]   - My intuition about proof spaces,
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:08.320]   you should be able to deform it.
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:09.840]   I mean that, 'cause then otherwise
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:10.840]   it doesn't even make sense.
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:13.560]   'Cause if the topology matters
[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:15.760]   of the way you move about the space,
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:17.360]   then I don't even know what that means.
[02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:19.760]   - Well, what it would mean is that you would have
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:23.560]   one way of doing a proof of something over here in algebra
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:25.120]   and another way of doing a proof of something
[02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:26.720]   over here in geometry,
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:29.440]   and there would not be an intermediate way
[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:30.960]   to map between those proofs.
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:32.240]   - But how would that be possible
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:35.280]   if they start at the same place and end at the same place?
[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:39.040]   - Well, it's the same thing as we've got points on a,
[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:41.000]   if we've got paths on a cylinder.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.240]   - Now I understand how it works in physical space,
[02:30:43.240 --> 02:30:44.440]   but it just doesn't,
[02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:47.160]   it feels like proof space shouldn't have that.
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:48.000]   Okay, I mean--
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.560]   - I'm not sure, I don't know.
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:50.760]   We'll know very soon,
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:52.080]   'cause we get to do some experiments.
[02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:53.840]   This is the great thing about this stuff,
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:57.120]   is that in fact, in the next few days,
[02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:58.760]   I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this.
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:02.040]   - So you're playing with like proofs in this kind of space?
[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:03.040]   - Yes, yes.
[02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:06.640]   I mean, so this is toy theories,
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:08.320]   and we've got good,
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:10.560]   so this kind of segues to perhaps another thing,
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:13.320]   which is this whole idea of multi-computation.
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:18.320]   So this is another kind of bigger idea that,
[02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:20.800]   so, okay, this has to do with
[02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:22.760]   how do you make models of things?
[02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:25.040]   And it's going to, it's some,
[02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:28.960]   so I've sort of claimed that there've been sort of four epochs
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:31.720]   in the history of making models of things.
[02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:35.600]   And this multi-computation thing is the fourth,
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:36.520]   is a new epoch.
[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:38.080]   - What are the first three?
[02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:40.680]   - The first one is back in antiquity,
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:42.600]   ancient Greek times,
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:44.560]   people were like, what's the universe made of?
[02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:47.800]   Oh, it's made of, you know, everything is water, Thales,
[02:31:47.800 --> 02:31:50.880]   you know, or everything is made of atoms.
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:53.000]   It's sort of what are things made of?
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.400]   Or, you know, there are these crystal spheres
[02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:58.240]   that represent where the planets are, and so on.
[02:31:58.240 --> 02:31:59.680]   It's like a structural idea
[02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:01.560]   of how the universe is constructed.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:03.280]   There's no real notion of dynamics,
[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:06.520]   it's just what is the universe, how is the universe made?
[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:08.640]   Then we get to the 1600s,
[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:11.080]   and we get to the sort of revolution of mathematics
[02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:12.920]   being introduced into physics.
[02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:15.920]   And then we have this kind of idea
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:18.680]   of you write down some equation,
[02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:20.560]   the what happens in the universe
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:22.360]   is the solving of that equation,
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:25.120]   time enters, but it's usually just a parameter.
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:28.080]   We just can, you know, sort of slide it back and forth
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:30.320]   and say, here's where it is.
[02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:33.480]   Okay, then we come to this kind of computational idea
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:38.160]   that I kind of started really pushing in the early 1980s.
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:40.200]   As a result, you know, the things we were talking about
[02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:43.280]   before about complexity, that was my motivation,
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:45.200]   but the bigger story was the story
[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:47.760]   of kind of computational models of things.
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:50.480]   And the big difference there from the mathematical models
[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:52.880]   is in mathematical models, there's an equation,
[02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:55.360]   you solve it, you got kind of slide time
[02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:57.000]   to the place where you want it.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.320]   In computational models, you give the rule
[02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:02.680]   and then you just say, go run the rule.
[02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:05.720]   And time is not something you get to slide,
[02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:07.960]   time is something where it just, you run the rule,
[02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:12.160]   time goes in steps, and that's how you work out
[02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:13.240]   how the system behaves.
[02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:15.560]   You don't, time is not just a parameter,
[02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:19.240]   time is something that is about the running of these rules.
[02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:21.360]   And so there's this computational irreducibility,
[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:23.160]   you can't jump ahead in time,
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:25.000]   but there's still, important thing is
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.040]   there's still one thread of time.
[02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:29.760]   It's still the case, you know, the cellular automaton state,
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:32.160]   then it has the next state and the next state and so on.
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:35.040]   The thing that is kind of, we've sort of tipped off
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:36.480]   by quantum mechanics in a sense,
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:39.720]   although it actually feeds back even into relativity
[02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:41.000]   and things like that,
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.840]   that there are these multiple threads of time.
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:46.360]   And so in this multi-computation paradigm,
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:48.800]   the kind of idea is, instead of there being
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:50.280]   this single thread of time,
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:52.720]   there are these kind of distributed asynchronous threads
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:54.640]   of time that are happening.
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:56.960]   And the thing that's sort of different there
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:58.800]   is if you want to know what happened,
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:01.240]   if you say what happened in the system,
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:03.480]   in the case of the computational paradigm,
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:06.640]   you just say, well, after a thousand steps,
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:08.600]   we got this result, right?
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:10.840]   But in the multi-computational paradigm,
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:11.840]   after a thousand steps,
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:13.400]   not even clear what a thousand steps means,
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:15.400]   because you've got all these different threads of time,
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:17.160]   but there is no state.
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:19.040]   There's all these different possible,
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:21.000]   you know, there's all these different parts.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:22.960]   And so the only way you can know what happened
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:25.360]   is to have some kind of observer who is saying,
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:28.800]   here's how to parse the results of what was going on.
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:30.240]   - Right, but that observer is embedded
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:32.360]   and they don't have a complete picture, so.
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:34.560]   - In the case of physics, that's right, yes.
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:37.320]   And then, but that's, but so the idea is
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:39.560]   that in this multi-computation setup,
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:42.440]   that it's this idea of these multiple threads of time
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:44.520]   and models that are based on that.
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:47.880]   And this is similar to what people think about
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:49.840]   in non-deterministic computation.
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:50.960]   So you have a Turing machine,
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:52.480]   usually it has a definite state,
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:54.560]   it follows another state, it follows another state.
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:55.960]   But typically what people have done
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:57.920]   when they've thought about these kinds of things
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:00.000]   is they've said, well, there are all these possible paths,
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.600]   a non-deterministic Turing machine
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:03.400]   can follow all these possible paths,
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:04.480]   but we just want one of them.
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:06.400]   We just want the one that's the winner,
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:08.600]   that factors the number or whatever else.
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:10.280]   And similarly, you know, it's the same story
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:11.920]   in logic programming and so on,
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:13.640]   where we say, we've got this goal,
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:15.360]   find us a path to that goal.
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:17.600]   I just want one path, then I'm happy.
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:19.280]   Or theorem proving, same story.
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:21.480]   I just want one proof and then I'm happy.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:24.480]   What's happening in multi-computation in physics
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:27.040]   is we actually care about many paths.
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:29.000]   And well, there is a case, for example,
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.880]   probabilistic programming is a version of multi-computation
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:33.760]   in which you're looking at all the paths,
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:36.560]   you're just asking for probabilities of things.
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:38.080]   But in a sense in physics,
[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:40.480]   we're taking different kinds of samplings.
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:41.680]   For example, in quantum mechanics,
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:43.880]   we're taking a different kind of sampling
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:46.080]   of all these multiple paths.
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:48.560]   But the thing that is notable
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:51.920]   is that when you're an observer embedded in this thing,
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:53.760]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:56.280]   with various other sort of footnotes and so on,
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:59.880]   it is inevitable that the thing that you parse
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:02.560]   out of the system looks like general relativity
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:04.320]   and quantum mechanics.
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:06.760]   In other words, that just by the very structure
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:08.920]   of this multi-computational setup,
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:11.280]   it inevitably is the case
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:14.800]   that you have certain emergent laws.
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:18.280]   Now, why is this perhaps not surprising?
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:20.400]   In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics,
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:22.840]   there are sort of inevitable emergent laws
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:25.720]   of sort of gas dynamics that are independent
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:28.440]   of the details of the molecular dynamics,
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:30.120]   sort of the same kind of thing.
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:31.520]   But I think what happens is,
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:32.920]   what's a sort of a funny thing
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:35.760]   that I've just been understanding very recently
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.160]   is when I kind of introduced this whole
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:42.480]   sort of computational paradigm complexity-ish thing
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:45.000]   back in the '80s, it was kind of like a big downer
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.120]   because it's like there's a lot of stuff you can't say
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:49.040]   about what systems will do.
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:50.080]   And then what I realized is,
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:52.520]   and then you might say, now we've got multi-computation,
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:53.760]   it's even worse.
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:55.400]   You know, it isn't just one thread of time
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:57.280]   that we can't explain, it's all these threads of time
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:58.840]   we can't explain anything.
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:01.160]   But the following thing happens.
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:04.240]   Because there is all this irreducibility
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:06.760]   and any detailed thing you might want to answer,
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:08.240]   it's very hard to answer.
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:10.360]   But when you have an observer
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:12.040]   who has certain characteristics
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:13.800]   like computational boundedness,
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:15.960]   sequentiality of time and so on,
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.280]   that observer only samples certain aspects
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:21.000]   of this incredible complexity going on
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.960]   in this multi-computational system.
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:26.360]   And that observer is sensitive only to
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:28.240]   some underlying core structure
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:30.040]   of this multi-computational system.
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:32.480]   There is all this irreducible computation going on,
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:35.760]   all these details, but to that kind of observer,
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:38.760]   what's important is only the core structure
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:41.600]   of multi-computation, which means that observer
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:44.720]   observes comparatively simple laws.
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:47.360]   And I think it is inevitable that that observer
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:50.580]   observes laws which are mathematically structured
[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:52.660]   like general relativity and quantum mechanics,
[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:56.000]   which by the way are the same law in our model of physics.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.920]   - So that's an explanation why there's simple laws
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:01.740]   that explain a lot for this observer.
[02:38:01.740 --> 02:38:02.580]   - Potentially, yes.
[02:38:02.580 --> 02:38:06.160]   But the place where this gets really interesting
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:09.120]   is there are all these fields of science
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:10.800]   where people have kind of gotten stuck,
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:12.520]   where they say we'd really love to have
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:14.680]   a physics-like theory of economics.
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:18.040]   We'd really love to have a physics-like law in linguistics.
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:20.600]   - We gotta talk about molecular biology here.
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:21.440]   - Okay.
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:24.480]   - So where does multi-computation come in for biology?
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:26.680]   Economics is super interesting too, but biology--
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:27.600]   - Okay, let's talk about that.
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:30.260]   So let's talk about chemistry for a second, okay?
[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:32.280]   So I mean, I have to say, you know,
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:34.000]   this is, it's such a weird business for me
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.840]   because, you know, there are these kind of
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.920]   paradigmatic ideas and then the actual applications.
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:39.920]   And it's like I've always said,
[02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:41.240]   I know nothing about chemistry.
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:42.920]   I learned all the chemistry I know, you know,
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:45.080]   the night before some exam when I was 14 years old.
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:47.360]   But I've actually learned a bunch more chemistry.
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:49.120]   And in Wolfram language these days,
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:50.640]   we have really pretty nice symbolic
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:52.200]   representation of chemistry.
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:54.180]   And in understanding the design of that,
[02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:56.660]   I've actually, I think, learned a certain amount of chemistry
[02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:58.680]   that if you quizzed me on sort of basic high school
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:01.120]   chemistry, I would probably totally fail.
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.520]   But, okay, so what is chemistry?
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:07.320]   I mean, chemistry is sort of a story of, you know,
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:09.840]   chemical reactions are like you've got
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:11.600]   this particular chemical, it's represented
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:14.000]   as some graph of, you know, these are,
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.760]   these are this configuration of molecules
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:17.440]   with these bonds and so on.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:19.620]   And a chemical reaction happens,
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:21.580]   you've got these sort of two graphs,
[02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:23.520]   they interact in some way, you've got another graph
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:24.840]   or multiple other graphs out.
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:28.840]   So that's kind of the, the sort of the abstract view
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:30.480]   of what's happening in chemistry.
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:33.640]   And so when you do a chemical synthesis, for example,
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:36.940]   you are given certain sort of these are possible reactions
[02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:40.220]   that can happen, and you're asked, can you piece together
[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:43.400]   this sequence of such reactions, a sequence of such sort of
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.720]   axiomatic reactions, usually called name reactions
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:48.060]   in chemistry, can you piece together a sequence
[02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:51.620]   of these reactions so that you get out at the end
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:53.980]   this great molecule you were trying to synthesize?
[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:56.340]   And so that's a story very much like theorem proving.
[02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:59.680]   And people have done, actually, they started in the 1960s,
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:02.600]   looking at kind of the theorem proving approach to that,
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:05.100]   although it didn't really, it didn't, it didn't,
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:07.480]   was sort of done too early, I think.
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:10.060]   But anyway, so that's kind of the view is that chemistry,
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:12.940]   chemical reactions are the story of all these different
[02:40:12.940 --> 02:40:16.180]   sort of paths of possible things that go on.
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:18.420]   Okay, let's go to an even lower level.
[02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:22.820]   Let's say, instead of asking about which species
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:24.220]   of molecules we're talking about,
[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:26.180]   let's look at individual molecules.
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:28.500]   And let's say we're looking at individual molecules,
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:30.420]   and they are having chemical reactions,
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:32.000]   and we're building up this big graph
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.540]   of all these reactions that are happening, okay?
[02:40:34.540 --> 02:40:37.100]   So then we've got this big graph, and by the way,
[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:40.260]   that big graph is incredibly similar
[02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:42.540]   to these hypergraph rewriting things.
[02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:45.860]   In fact, in the underlying theory of multi-computation,
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:48.240]   there are these things we call token event graphs,
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:52.160]   which are basically, you've broken your state into tokens,
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:53.300]   like in the case of a hypergraph,
[02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:55.100]   you've broken it into hyperedges,
[02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:58.380]   and each event is just consuming some number of tokens
[02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:00.100]   and producing some number of tokens.
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:01.260]   - Yeah, but then you have to,
[02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:04.420]   there's a lot of work to be done on update rules.
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:06.700]   - In terms of what they actually are for chemistry?
[02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:09.740]   - Yeah, what they are for our observed chemistry.
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:11.180]   - Yes, indeed, yes, indeed.
[02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:12.660]   We've been working on that, actually,
[02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:15.580]   because we have this beautiful system in Wolfram language
[02:41:15.580 --> 02:41:17.220]   for representing chemistry symbolically.
[02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:20.180]   So we actually have, this is an ongoing thing
[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:21.420]   to actually figure out what they are
[02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:22.780]   for some practical cases.
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:24.720]   - Does that require human injection,
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:28.600]   or can it be automatically discovered, these update rules?
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:30.300]   - Well, if we could do quantum chemistry better,
[02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:31.620]   we could probably discover them automatically,
[02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:34.460]   but I think in reality right now,
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:36.380]   it's like there are these particular reactions.
[02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:38.560]   And really, to understand what's going on,
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:41.860]   we're probably gonna pick a particular subtype of chemistry,
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:44.700]   and just, because let me explain where this is going.
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:47.480]   The place that, here's where this is going.
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:51.060]   So, you've got this whole network of all these molecules
[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:53.180]   having all these reactions and so on.
[02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:55.780]   And this is some whole multi-computational story,
[02:41:55.780 --> 02:42:00.780]   because each sort of chemical reaction event
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:02.300]   is its own separate event.
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:03.980]   We're saying they all happen asynchronously.
[02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:06.820]   We're not describing in what order they happen.
[02:42:06.820 --> 02:42:08.020]   Maybe that order is governed
[02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:10.740]   by some quantum mechanics thing, doesn't really matter.
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:12.840]   We're just saying they happen in some order.
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:14.980]   And then we ask, what is the,
[02:42:14.980 --> 02:42:17.540]   how do we think about the system?
[02:42:17.540 --> 02:42:20.020]   Well, this thing is some kind
[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:21.600]   of big multi-computational system.
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:24.140]   The question is, what is the chemical observer?
[02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:26.420]   And one possible chemical observer is,
[02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:27.300]   all you care about is,
[02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:29.520]   did you make that particular drug molecule?
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.880]   You're just asking for the one path.
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:33.500]   Another thing you might care about is,
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:36.760]   I want to know the concentration of each species.
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:39.400]   I want to know, at every stage,
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:40.980]   I'm going to solve the differential equations
[02:42:40.980 --> 02:42:42.500]   that represent the concentrations,
[02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:44.200]   and I want to know what those all are.
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:46.320]   But there's more, because when,
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:47.520]   and it's kind of like,
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:50.380]   you're going below in statistical mechanics,
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:52.920]   there's kind of all these molecules bouncing around,
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:56.100]   and you might say, we're just going to ignore,
[02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:59.000]   we're just going to look at the aggregate densities
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.160]   of certain kinds of molecules,
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:01.560]   but you can look at a lower level.
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:04.960]   You can look at this whole graph of possible interactions.
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:07.400]   And so, the kind of the idea would be,
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:10.640]   what, is the only chemical observer,
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:13.320]   one who just cares about overall concentrations,
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:15.280]   or can there be a chemical observer
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:17.840]   who cares about this network of what happened?
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:20.760]   And so, that, the question then is,
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:22.240]   so let me give an analogy.
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:23.960]   So this is where I think this is potentially
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:27.920]   very relevant to molecular biology and molecular computing.
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:29.720]   When we think about a computation,
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:32.480]   usually we say it's input, it's output.
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:35.440]   We, you know, or chemistry, we say, there's this input,
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:38.000]   we're going to make this molecule as the output.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.120]   But what if what we actually encode,
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:42.600]   what if our computation,
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:44.240]   what if the thing we care about
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:46.600]   is some part of this dynamic network?
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:48.560]   What if it isn't just the input and the output
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:49.400]   that we care about?
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:51.200]   What if there's some dynamics of the network
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:52.040]   that we care about?
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:54.540]   Now, imagine you're a chemical observer.
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:56.020]   What is a chemical observer?
[02:43:56.020 --> 02:43:57.860]   Well, in molecular biology,
[02:43:57.860 --> 02:44:00.880]   there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers.
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:02.760]   There are membranes that exist
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:04.720]   that have, you know, different kinds of molecules
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:06.880]   that can bind to them, things like this.
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:10.320]   It's not obvious that the, from a human scale,
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:12.480]   we just measure the concentration of something,
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:13.880]   is the relevant story.
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:15.960]   We can imagine that, for example,
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:18.600]   when we look at this whole network of possible reactions,
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:20.480]   we can imagine, you know, at a physical level,
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:22.200]   we can imagine, well, what was the actual
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:24.800]   momentum direction of that molecule?
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:26.740]   What was it, which we don't pay any attention to
[02:44:26.740 --> 02:44:29.020]   when we're just talking about chemical concentrations.
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:31.180]   What was the orientation of that molecule?
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:32.540]   These kinds of things.
[02:44:32.540 --> 02:44:36.180]   And so here's the place where I have a little suspicion.
[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:37.020]   Okay?
[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:38.540]   So one of the questions in biology
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:40.660]   is what matters in biology?
[02:44:40.660 --> 02:44:42.780]   And that is, you know, we have all these chemical reactions.
[02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:45.860]   We have all these molecular processes going on
[02:44:45.860 --> 02:44:48.220]   in biological systems.
[02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:49.740]   What matters?
[02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:51.920]   And, you know, one of the things is
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:53.540]   to be able to tell what matters,
[02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:56.480]   well, so a big story of the what matters question
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:58.640]   was what happened in genetics in 1953,
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:01.820]   when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked.
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:03.160]   Because before that time, you know,
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:04.960]   genetics had been all these different effects
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:06.360]   and complicated things.
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:09.120]   And then it was realized, ah, there's something new.
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:11.240]   A molecule can store information,
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:13.160]   which wasn't obvious before that time.
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:14.880]   A single molecule can store information.
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:18.080]   So there's a place where there can be something important
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:19.600]   that's happening in molecular biology,
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:21.400]   and it's just in the sequence
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:23.420]   that's storing information in a molecule.
[02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:27.760]   So the possibility now is, imagine this dynamic network,
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:31.200]   this, you know, causal graphs and multi-way causal graphs
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:34.080]   and so on, that represent all of these different reactions
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:35.160]   between molecules.
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:37.400]   What if there is some aspect of that
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:39.000]   that is storing information
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.120]   that's relevant for molecular biology?
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:42.920]   - And the dynamic aspect of that.
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:43.760]   - Yes, that's right.
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:46.120]   - So it's similar to how the structure
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:49.280]   of a DNA molecule stores information.
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:51.160]   It could be the dynamics of the system
[02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:52.680]   somehow stores information.
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:55.180]   And this kind of process might allow you
[02:45:55.180 --> 02:45:58.540]   to give predictions of what that would be.
[02:45:58.540 --> 02:46:02.180]   - Well, yes, but also imagine that you're trying to do,
[02:46:02.180 --> 02:46:03.860]   for example, imagine you're trying
[02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:06.340]   to do molecular computation, okay?
[02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:07.940]   You might think the way we're gonna do
[02:46:07.940 --> 02:46:10.460]   molecular computation is, we're just gonna run the thing,
[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:11.460]   we're gonna see what came out,
[02:46:11.460 --> 02:46:13.500]   we're gonna see what molecule came out.
[02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:16.260]   This is saying, that's not the only thing you can do.
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:18.300]   There is a different kind of chemical observer
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:20.120]   that you can imagine constructing,
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:23.680]   which is somehow sensitive to this dynamic network.
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:25.620]   Exactly how that works, how we make that measurement,
[02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:27.960]   I don't know, but I have a few ideas,
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:31.580]   but that's what's important, so to speak.
[02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:32.940]   And that means, and by the way,
[02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:35.200]   you can do the same thing even for Turing machines.
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:38.260]   You can say, if you have a multi-way Turing machine,
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:40.100]   you can say, how do you compute
[02:46:40.100 --> 02:46:41.640]   with a multi-way Turing machine?
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:44.500]   You can't say, well, we've got this input and this output,
[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:46.620]   because the thing has all these threads of time,
[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:48.220]   and it's got lots of outputs.
[02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:50.160]   And so then you say, well, what does it even mean
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:52.400]   to be a universal multi-way Turing machine?
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:54.360]   I don't fully know the answer to that.
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:57.040]   - That's an interesting idea, it would freak Turing out,
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:00.040]   for sure, 'cause then the dynamics,
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:02.920]   the trajectory of the computation matters.
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:06.480]   - Yes, yes, but the thing is,
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:08.960]   so this is, again, a story of what's the observer,
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:11.760]   so to speak, in chemistry, what's the observer there?
[02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:14.760]   Now, to give an example of where that might matter,
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:18.720]   a very sort of present-day example is in immunology,
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:22.860]   where we have whatever it is,
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:25.060]   10 billion different kinds of antibodies
[02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:27.660]   that are all these different shapes and so on.
[02:47:27.660 --> 02:47:31.080]   We have a trillion different kinds of T-cell receptors
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:36.080]   that we produce, and the traditional theory of immunology
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:38.060]   is this clonal selection theory
[02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:39.980]   where we are constantly producing,
[02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:42.540]   randomly producing all these different antibodies,
[02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:45.000]   and as soon as one of them binds to an antigen,
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.360]   then that one gets amplified,
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:49.440]   and we produce more of that antibody and so on.
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:53.640]   Back in the 1960s, an immunologist called Nils Joerner,
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:56.120]   who was the guy who invented monoclonal antibodies,
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:59.440]   various other things, kind of had this network theory
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:01.000]   of the immune system, where it would be like,
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.520]   well, we produce antibodies,
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:05.120]   but then we produce antibodies to the antibodies,
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:07.960]   anti-antibodies, and we produce anti-anti-antibodies,
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:10.800]   and we get this whole dynamic network of interactions
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:13.180]   between different immune system cells,
[02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:18.080]   and that was kind of a qualitative theory at that time,
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:20.260]   and I've been a little disappointed
[02:48:20.260 --> 02:48:22.540]   'cause I've been studying immunology a bit recently,
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:25.440]   and I knew something about this 35 years ago or something,
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:27.460]   and I knew, I'd read a bunch of the books,
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:29.420]   and I'd talked to a bunch of the people and so on,
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:33.660]   and it was like an emerging theoretical immunology world,
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:35.420]   and then I look at the books now,
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:37.540]   and they're very thick because they've got,
[02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.900]   there's just a ton known about immunology,
[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:41.640]   and all these different pathways,
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:43.800]   all these different details and so on,
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:46.240]   but the theoretical sections seem to have shrunk,
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:51.600]   and so it's, so the question is, what,
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:53.200]   for example, immune memory,
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:55.040]   where does the immune memory reside?
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:57.800]   Is it actually some cell sitting in our bone marrow
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:48:59.840]   that is living for the whole of our lives
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:01.560]   that's gonna spring into action
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:04.000]   as soon as we're shown the same antigen,
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:05.560]   or is it something different from that?
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:07.260]   Is it something more dynamic?
[02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:09.640]   Is it something more like some network of interactions
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:12.420]   between these different kinds of immune system cells
[02:49:12.420 --> 02:49:13.660]   and so on, and it's known
[02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:15.880]   that there are plenty of interactions between T cells,
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:18.280]   and there's plenty of dynamics,
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:21.740]   but what the consequence of that dynamics is is not clear,
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:24.640]   and to have a qualitative theory for that
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:26.480]   doesn't seem to exist.
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:28.520]   In fact, I was just been trying to study this,
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:30.840]   so I'm quite incomplete in my study of these things,
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:32.520]   but I was a little bit taken aback
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:34.460]   'cause I've been looking at these things,
[02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:35.920]   and it's like, and then they get to the end
[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:38.360]   where they have the most advanced theory that they've got,
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:41.560]   and it turns out it's the cellular automaton theory.
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:44.720]   It's like, okay, well, at least I understand that theory,
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:49.280]   but I think that the possibility is that
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:53.600]   this is a place where if you want to know,
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:56.140]   explain roughly how the immune system works,
[02:49:56.140 --> 02:49:58.440]   it ends up being this dynamic network,
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:02.360]   and then the immune consciousness, so to speak,
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:06.120]   the observer, ends up being something that in the end,
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:08.720]   it's kind of like does the human get sick or whatever,
[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:12.040]   but it's something which is a complicated story
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:14.560]   that relates to this whole sort of dynamic network
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:16.560]   and so on, and I think that's another place
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:18.440]   where this kind of notion of,
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:21.700]   where I think multi-computation has the possibility.
[02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:23.240]   See, one of the things, okay,
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:24.440]   you can end up with something where,
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:27.000]   yes, there is a general relativity in there,
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:28.560]   but it turns out, but it may turn out
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:31.860]   that the observer who sees general relativity
[02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:34.640]   in the immune system is an observer that's irrelevant
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:36.880]   to what we care about about the immune system.
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:38.640]   I mean, it could be, yes, there is some effect
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:42.840]   where there's some time dilation of T cells
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:44.780]   interacting with whatever, but it's like,
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:46.800]   that's an effect that's just irrelevant,
[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:49.880]   and the thing we actually care about is things about
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:51.920]   what happens when you have a vaccine
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:53.840]   that goes into some place in shape space,
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:56.560]   and how does that affect other places in shape space,
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:50:58.160]   and how does that spread?
[02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:01.080]   What's the analog of the speed of light in shape space,
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:02.000]   for example?
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:03.280]   That's an important issue
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:04.800]   if you have one of these dynamic theories.
[02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:08.480]   It's like you poke into shape space by having,
[02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:10.160]   let's say, a vaccine or something
[02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:13.160]   that has a particular configuration in shape space.
[02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:16.880]   How quickly, as this dynamic network spreads out,
[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:20.360]   how quickly do you get sort of other antibodies
[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:22.360]   in different places in shape space, things like that.
[02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:23.320]   - When you say shape space,
[02:51:23.320 --> 02:51:25.240]   you mean the shape of the molecules?
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:27.680]   And then, so this is like,
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:29.480]   could be deeply connected to the protein
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:32.240]   and multi-protein folding, all of that kind of stuff.
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:33.960]   - To be able to say something interesting
[02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:36.400]   about the dance of proteins.
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:37.240]   - Right, exactly.
[02:51:37.240 --> 02:51:39.440]   - That actually has an impact on
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:42.920]   helping develop drugs, for example,
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:46.600]   or has an impact on virology, immunology,
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:47.440]   helping to deal with viruses.
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:49.880]   - Well, I think the big thing is,
[02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:52.060]   when we think about molecular biology,
[02:51:52.060 --> 02:51:57.320]   what is the qualitative way to think about it?
[02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:00.280]   In other words, is it chemical reaction networks?
[02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:05.280]   Is it genetics, DNA, big news,
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:08.640]   it's kind of, there's a digital aspect to the whole thing.
[02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:10.940]   What is the qualitative way to think about
[02:52:10.940 --> 02:52:13.240]   how things work in biology?
[02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:14.460]   When we think about, I don't know,
[02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:16.440]   some phenomenon like aging or something,
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:17.960]   which is a big, complicated phenomenon,
[02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:20.360]   which just seems to have all these different tentacles,
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:22.920]   is it really the case that that can be thought about
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:25.240]   in some, without DNA,
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:28.480]   when people were describing genetic phenomena,
[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:31.080]   there were dominant, recessive, this, that, and the other,
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:32.840]   it got very, very complicated,
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:35.200]   and then people realized, oh, it's just,
[02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:37.880]   and what is a gene, and so on, and so on, and so on,
[02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:39.800]   then people realize it's just base pairs,
[02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:41.440]   and there's this digital representation.
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:42.280]   And so the question is,
[02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:44.640]   what is the overarching representation
[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:47.360]   that we can now start to think about using in microbiology?
[02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:48.560]   I don't know how this will work out,
[02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:51.000]   and this is, again, one of these things where,
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:54.280]   and the place where that gets important is,
[02:52:54.280 --> 02:52:58.100]   maybe molecular biology is doing molecular computing
[02:52:58.100 --> 02:53:00.520]   by using some dynamic process
[02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:03.360]   that is something where it is very happily saying,
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:04.720]   oh, I just got a result.
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:06.440]   It's in the dynamic structure of this network.
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:08.400]   Now I'm gonna go and do some other thing
[02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:10.320]   based on that result, for example,
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:12.440]   but we're like, oh, I don't know what's going on.
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:15.780]   It's just, we just measured the levels of these chemicals,
[02:53:15.780 --> 02:53:17.640]   and we couldn't conclude anything,
[02:53:17.640 --> 02:53:19.760]   but it just, we're looking at the wrong thing.
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:23.600]   And so that's kind of the potential there,
[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:26.000]   and it's, I mean, these things are,
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.740]   I don't know, it's, for me, it's like,
[02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:31.500]   I've not really, that was not a view.
[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:33.060]   I mean, I've thought about molecular computing
[02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:34.540]   for ages and ages and ages,
[02:53:34.540 --> 02:53:37.100]   and I've always imagined that the big story
[02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:40.540]   is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology
[02:53:40.540 --> 02:53:43.020]   of like, can we make a molecular scale constructor
[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:45.940]   that will just build a molecule in any shape?
[02:53:45.940 --> 02:53:48.780]   But I don't think, I'm now increasingly concluding
[02:53:48.780 --> 02:53:50.240]   that's not the big point.
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:52.360]   The big point is something more dynamic.
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:54.180]   That will be an interesting end point
[02:53:54.180 --> 02:53:55.220]   for any of these things,
[02:53:55.220 --> 02:53:57.940]   but that's perhaps not the thing,
[02:53:57.940 --> 02:54:00.340]   'cause the one example we have in molecular computing
[02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:03.380]   that's really working is us biological organisms.
[02:54:03.380 --> 02:54:06.340]   And maybe the thing that's important there
[02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:10.060]   is not this, what chemicals do you make, so to speak,
[02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:11.980]   but more this kind of dynamic process.
[02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:14.100]   - Dynamic process, and then you can have a good model
[02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:16.360]   like the hypergraph to then explore,
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:20.660]   what, like simulate, again, make predictions,
[02:54:20.660 --> 02:54:22.220]   and if they-- - I think just have a way
[02:54:22.220 --> 02:54:24.020]   to reason about biology.
[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.740]   I mean, it's hard.
[02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:29.420]   First of all, biology doesn't have theories like physics.
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:31.540]   Physics is a much more successful
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:34.500]   sort of global theory kind of area.
[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:37.340]   Biology, what are the global theories of biology?
[02:54:37.340 --> 02:54:39.040]   Pretty much Darwinian evolution.
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:41.700]   That's the only global theory of biology.
[02:54:41.700 --> 02:54:44.820]   Any other theory is just a, well, the kidneys work this way,
[02:54:44.820 --> 02:54:46.760]   this thing works this way, and so on.
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:48.860]   There isn't, I suppose another global theory
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:50.980]   is digital information in DNA.
[02:54:50.980 --> 02:54:53.260]   That's another sort of global fact about biology.
[02:54:53.260 --> 02:54:56.340]   - But the difficult thing to do is to match
[02:54:56.340 --> 02:55:00.540]   something you have a model of in the hypergraph
[02:55:00.540 --> 02:55:03.460]   to the actual, like how do you discover the theory?
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:04.980]   How do you discover the theory?
[02:55:04.980 --> 02:55:07.220]   Okay, you have something that looks nice and makes sense,
[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:10.420]   but like you have to match it to validation.
[02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:12.340]   - Oh, sure, right. - And that's tricky
[02:55:12.340 --> 02:55:15.220]   because you're walking around in the dark.
[02:55:15.220 --> 02:55:16.140]   - Not entirely.
[02:55:16.140 --> 02:55:18.180]   I mean, so, you know, for example,
[02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:19.980]   in what we've been trying to think about
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:23.060]   is take actual chemical reactions, okay?
[02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:25.900]   So, you know, one of my goals is
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:28.340]   can I compute the primes with molecules?
[02:55:28.340 --> 02:55:30.020]   Okay, that's, if I can do that,
[02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:32.860]   then I kind of, maybe I can compute things.
[02:55:32.860 --> 02:55:34.900]   And, you know, there's this nice automated lab,
[02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:37.220]   these guys, these Emerald Cloud Lab people
[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:38.980]   have built with Wolfram Language and so on.
[02:55:38.980 --> 02:55:40.860]   That's an actual physical lab,
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:42.700]   and you send it a piece of Wolfram Language code,
[02:55:42.700 --> 02:55:44.140]   and it goes and, you know,
[02:55:44.140 --> 02:55:45.980]   actually does physical experiments.
[02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:47.900]   And so one of my goals,
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:50.020]   because I'm not a test tube kind of guy,
[02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:52.060]   I'm more of a software kind of person,
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:54.380]   is can I make something where, you know,
[02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:56.900]   in this automated lab, we can actually get it
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:55:58.820]   so that there's some gel that we made,
[02:55:58.820 --> 02:56:00.900]   and, you know, the positions of the stripes are the primes.
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:02.900]   - Is the primes, I love it, yeah.
[02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:06.020]   - I mean, that would be an example of where,
[02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:08.740]   and that would be with a particular, you know,
[02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:12.100]   framework for actually doing the molecular computing,
[02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:13.900]   you know, with particular kinds of molecules.
[02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:17.580]   And there's a lot of kind of ambient technological mess,
[02:56:17.580 --> 02:56:19.700]   so to speak, associated with, oh, is it carbon?
[02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:21.180]   Is it this, is it that?
[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:24.020]   You know, is it important that there's a bromine atom here?
[02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:24.940]   Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:27.940]   This is all chemistry that I don't know much about.
[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:30.300]   And, you know, that's a sort of, you know,
[02:56:30.300 --> 02:56:32.500]   unfortunately, that's down at the level, you know,
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:34.700]   I would like to be at the software level,
[02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:37.180]   not at the level of the transistors, so to speak.
[02:56:37.180 --> 02:56:39.700]   But in chemistry, you know, there's a certain amount
[02:56:39.700 --> 02:56:41.680]   we have to do, I think, at the level of transistors
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:44.100]   before we get up to being able to do it,
[02:56:44.100 --> 02:56:45.740]   although, you know, automated labs
[02:56:45.740 --> 02:56:48.620]   certainly help in setting that up.
[02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:53.100]   - I talked to a guy named Charles Hoskinson.
[02:56:53.100 --> 02:56:55.820]   He mentioned that he's collaborating with you.
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:56.940]   He's an interesting guy.
[02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:00.500]   He sends me papers on, speaking of automated theorem
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:01.420]   proving a lot.
[02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:04.180]   He's exceptionally well read on that area as well.
[02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:06.780]   So what's the nature of your collaboration with him?
[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:08.420]   He's the creator of Cardano.
[02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:12.300]   What's the nature of the collaboration between Cardano
[02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:14.340]   and the whole space of blockchain and Wolfram,
[02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:17.420]   Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Blockchain, all that kind of stuff?
[02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:21.220]   - Well, okay, we're segueing to a slightly different world.
[02:57:21.220 --> 02:57:25.300]   But so, although not completely unconnected.
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:27.860]   - Right, the whole thing is somehow connected.
[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:31.060]   - I know, I mean, you know, the strange thing in my life
[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:33.580]   is I've sort of alternated between doing basic science
[02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:37.140]   and doing technology about five times in my life so far.
[02:57:37.140 --> 02:57:40.140]   And the thing that's just crazy about it is, you know,
[02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:42.300]   every time I do one of these alternations,
[02:57:42.300 --> 02:57:45.420]   I think there's not gonna be a way back to the other thing.
[02:57:45.420 --> 02:57:47.060]   And like I thought for this physics project,
[02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:48.020]   I thought, you know,
[02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:50.300]   we're doing fundamental theory of physics,
[02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:53.300]   maybe it'll have an application in 200 years.
[02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:55.460]   But now I've realized,
[02:57:55.460 --> 02:57:57.500]   actually this multi-computation idea
[02:57:57.500 --> 02:57:59.580]   is applicable here and now.
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:02.380]   It's, and in fact, it's also giving us this way.
[02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:03.780]   I'll just mention one other thing
[02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:05.740]   and then we can talk about blockchain.
[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:09.620]   The question of,
[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:11.780]   actually that relates to several different things,
[02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:15.060]   but one of the things about, okay,
[02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:17.900]   so our Wolfram Language,
[02:58:17.900 --> 02:58:20.740]   which is our attempt to kind of represent everything
[02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:22.460]   in the world computationally.
[02:58:22.460 --> 02:58:25.300]   And it's the thing I kind of started building 40 years ago
[02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:29.500]   in the form of actual Wolfram Language 35 years ago.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:30.900]   It's kind of this idea of,
[02:58:30.900 --> 02:58:35.140]   can we express things about the world
[02:58:35.140 --> 02:58:36.860]   in computational terms?
[02:58:36.860 --> 02:58:38.500]   And, you know, we've come a long way
[02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:39.940]   in being able to do that.
[02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:42.300]   Wolfram Alpha is kind of the consumer version of that
[02:58:42.300 --> 02:58:44.580]   where you're just using natural languages as input.
[02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:47.900]   And it turns it into our symbolic language.
[02:58:47.900 --> 02:58:49.860]   And that's, you know, the symbolic language,
[02:58:49.860 --> 02:58:51.660]   Wolfram Language is what people use
[02:58:51.660 --> 02:58:54.020]   and have been using for the last 33 years.
[02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:57.500]   Actually, Mathematica, which is its first instantiation,
[02:58:57.500 --> 02:59:01.860]   will be one third of a century old in October.
[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:06.140]   And that, it's kind of interesting.
[02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:07.500]   - What do you mean one third of a century?
[02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:08.860]   Does that mean 33 or 30?
[02:59:08.860 --> 02:59:09.700]   What are we--
[02:59:09.700 --> 02:59:10.900]   - 33 and a third.
[02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:12.700]   - 33 and a third.
[02:59:12.860 --> 02:59:14.860]   (laughing)
[02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:17.060]   - I've never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary,
[02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:17.900]   but I like it.
[02:59:17.900 --> 02:59:19.220]   - I know, a third of a century though.
[02:59:19.220 --> 02:59:22.180]   It's like, you don't get many slices of a century
[02:59:22.180 --> 02:59:23.260]   that are interesting.
[02:59:23.260 --> 02:59:25.260]   But, you know, I think that the thing
[02:59:25.260 --> 02:59:28.100]   that's really striking about that is that means,
[02:59:28.100 --> 02:59:29.980]   you know, including the whole sort of technology stack
[02:59:29.980 --> 02:59:32.060]   I built around that's about 40 years old,
[02:59:32.060 --> 02:59:33.820]   and that means it's a significant fraction
[02:59:33.820 --> 02:59:36.340]   of the total age of the computer industry.
[02:59:36.340 --> 02:59:38.140]   And it's, I mean, I think it's cool
[02:59:38.140 --> 02:59:39.500]   that we can still run, you know,
[02:59:39.500 --> 02:59:42.700]   Mathematica version one programs today and so on,
[02:59:42.700 --> 02:59:45.100]   and we've sort of maintained compatibility.
[02:59:45.100 --> 02:59:47.300]   And we've been just building this big tower
[02:59:47.300 --> 02:59:49.620]   all those years of just more and more
[02:59:49.620 --> 02:59:51.060]   and more computational capabilities.
[02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:51.900]   It's sort of interesting.
[02:59:51.900 --> 02:59:55.260]   We just made this picture of kind of the different
[02:59:55.260 --> 02:59:59.020]   kind of threads of computational content,
[02:59:59.020 --> 03:00:00.660]   of, you know, mathematical content,
[03:00:00.660 --> 03:00:04.220]   and, you know, all sorts of things with, you know,
[03:00:04.220 --> 03:00:06.580]   data and graphs and whatever else.
[03:00:06.580 --> 03:00:07.780]   And what you see in this picture
[03:00:07.780 --> 03:00:09.620]   is about the first 10 years,
[03:00:09.620 --> 03:00:11.980]   it's kind of like it's just a few threads.
[03:00:11.980 --> 03:00:15.260]   And then about maybe 15, 20 years ago,
[03:00:15.260 --> 03:00:17.180]   it kind of explodes in this whole collection
[03:00:17.180 --> 03:00:19.980]   of different threads of all these different capabilities
[03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:21.460]   that are now part of Wolfram Language
[03:00:21.460 --> 03:00:23.500]   and representing different things in the world.
[03:00:23.500 --> 03:00:27.260]   But the thing that was super lucky in some sense
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:29.340]   is it's all based on one idea.
[03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:31.980]   It's all based on the idea of symbolic expressions
[03:00:31.980 --> 03:00:34.580]   and transformation rules for symbolic expressions,
[03:00:34.580 --> 03:00:36.300]   which was kind of what I originally
[03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:39.940]   put into this SMP system back in 1979
[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:42.980]   that was a predecessor of the whole Wolfram Language stack.
[03:00:42.980 --> 03:00:46.220]   So that idea was an idea that I got
[03:00:46.220 --> 03:00:47.500]   from sort of trying to understand
[03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:48.980]   mathematical logic and so on.
[03:00:48.980 --> 03:00:52.180]   It was my attempt to kind of make a general
[03:00:52.180 --> 03:00:54.980]   human comprehensible model of computation
[03:00:54.980 --> 03:00:57.260]   of just everything is a symbolic expression
[03:00:57.260 --> 03:01:00.100]   and all you do is transform symbolic expressions.
[03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:02.860]   And, you know, in retrospect,
[03:01:02.860 --> 03:01:05.180]   I was very lucky that I understood
[03:01:05.180 --> 03:01:07.020]   as little as I understood then,
[03:01:07.020 --> 03:01:08.700]   because had I understood more,
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:10.700]   I would have been completely freaked out
[03:01:10.700 --> 03:01:11.940]   about all the different ways
[03:01:11.940 --> 03:01:14.660]   that that kind of model can fail.
[03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:18.180]   Because what do you do when you have a symbolic expression,
[03:01:18.180 --> 03:01:20.620]   you make transformations for symbolic expressions?
[03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:22.780]   Well, for example, one question is there may be
[03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:24.620]   many transformations that could be made
[03:01:24.620 --> 03:01:26.940]   in a very multi-computational kind of way.
[03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:28.700]   But what we're doing is picking,
[03:01:28.700 --> 03:01:31.860]   we're using the first transformation that applies.
[03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:34.420]   And we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point.
[03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:35.820]   And that's the result.
[03:01:35.820 --> 03:01:37.300]   And that's kind of a very,
[03:01:37.300 --> 03:01:40.380]   it's kind of a way of sort of sliding around
[03:01:40.380 --> 03:01:42.220]   the edge of multi-computation.
[03:01:42.220 --> 03:01:44.620]   And back when I was working on SMP and things,
[03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:46.300]   I actually thought about these questions
[03:01:46.300 --> 03:01:48.740]   about how, you know, how,
[03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:52.140]   what determines this kind of evaluation path.
[03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:54.340]   So for example, you know, you work out Fibonacci,
[03:01:54.340 --> 03:01:56.020]   you know, Fibonacci is a recursive thing.
[03:01:56.020 --> 03:01:59.100]   F of N is F of N minus one plus F of N minus two.
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:01.780]   And you get this whole tree of recursion, right?
[03:02:01.780 --> 03:02:03.500]   And there's the question of how do you evaluate
[03:02:03.500 --> 03:02:04.460]   that tree of recursion?
[03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:06.500]   Do you do it sort of depth first,
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:07.980]   where you go all the way down one side?
[03:02:07.980 --> 03:02:09.580]   Do you do it breadth first,
[03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:12.180]   where you're kind of collecting the terms together,
[03:02:12.180 --> 03:02:13.020]   where you know that, you know,
[03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:14.260]   F of eight plus F of seven,
[03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:15.780]   F of seven plus F of six,
[03:02:15.780 --> 03:02:18.020]   you can collect the F of sevens and so on.
[03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:20.780]   These are, you know, I didn't realize it at the time.
[03:02:20.780 --> 03:02:21.620]   It's kind of funny.
[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:25.220]   I was working on gauge field theories back in 1979.
[03:02:25.220 --> 03:02:29.220]   And I was also working on the evaluation model in SMP
[03:02:29.220 --> 03:02:30.740]   and they're the same problem.
[03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:33.420]   But it took me 40 more years to realize that.
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:35.460]   And this question about how you do
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:37.220]   this sort of evaluation front,
[03:02:37.220 --> 03:02:39.220]   that's a question of reference frames.
[03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:42.540]   It's a question of kind of the story of,
[03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:45.580]   I mean, that is basically this question of
[03:02:45.580 --> 03:02:48.300]   in what order is the universe evaluated?
[03:02:48.300 --> 03:02:50.620]   And that, and so what you realize is
[03:02:50.620 --> 03:02:52.220]   there's this whole sort of world
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:54.620]   of different kinds of computation that you can do
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:56.140]   sort of multi computationally.
[03:02:56.140 --> 03:02:58.140]   And that's an interesting thing.
[03:02:58.140 --> 03:02:59.140]   It has a lot of implications
[03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:01.180]   for distributed computing and so on.
[03:03:01.180 --> 03:03:03.620]   It also has a potential implication for blockchain,
[03:03:03.620 --> 03:03:05.380]   which we haven't fully worked out,
[03:03:05.380 --> 03:03:07.940]   which is, and this is not what we're doing with Cardano,
[03:03:07.940 --> 03:03:09.940]   but this is a different thing.
[03:03:09.940 --> 03:03:15.940]   This is something where one of the questions is
[03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:17.900]   when you have, in a sense,
[03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:21.420]   blockchain is a deeply sequentialized story of time.
[03:03:21.420 --> 03:03:22.660]   Because in blockchain,
[03:03:22.660 --> 03:03:25.220]   there's just one copy of the ledger.
[03:03:25.220 --> 03:03:27.620]   And you're saying, this is what happened.
[03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:29.300]   You know, time has progressed in this way.
[03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:30.780]   And there are little things around the edge
[03:03:30.780 --> 03:03:33.180]   as you try and reach consensus and so on.
[03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:36.660]   And, you know, actually we just recently,
[03:03:36.660 --> 03:03:38.460]   we've had this little conference we organized
[03:03:38.460 --> 03:03:40.580]   about the theory of distributed consensus.
[03:03:40.580 --> 03:03:42.900]   'Cause I realized that a bunch of interesting things
[03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:45.380]   that some of our science can tell one about that.
[03:03:45.380 --> 03:03:47.860]   But that's a different, let's not go down that path.
[03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:49.220]   - Yeah, but distributed consensus,
[03:03:49.220 --> 03:03:51.140]   that still has a sequential, there's like one-
[03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:52.380]   - There's still sequentiality.
[03:03:52.380 --> 03:03:53.220]   So distributed consensus-
[03:03:53.220 --> 03:03:55.460]   - Don't tell me you're thinking through like
[03:03:55.460 --> 03:03:59.020]   how to apply multi computation to blockchain.
[03:03:59.020 --> 03:04:03.060]   - Yes, and so that becomes a story of, you know,
[03:04:03.060 --> 03:04:06.660]   instead of transactions all having to settle in one ledger,
[03:04:06.660 --> 03:04:09.580]   it's like a story of all these different ledgers
[03:04:09.580 --> 03:04:12.220]   and they all have to have some ultimate consistency,
[03:04:12.220 --> 03:04:14.460]   which is what causal invariance would give one,
[03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:15.940]   but it can take a while.
[03:04:15.940 --> 03:04:17.420]   And the, it can take a while
[03:04:17.420 --> 03:04:19.180]   is kind of like quantum mechanics.
[03:04:19.180 --> 03:04:20.860]   So it's kind of what's happening is
[03:04:20.860 --> 03:04:23.140]   there are these different paths of history
[03:04:23.140 --> 03:04:24.740]   that correspond to, you know,
[03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:27.100]   in one path of history, you got paid this amount.
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:29.500]   In another path of history, you got paid this amount.
[03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:32.460]   In the end, the universe will always become consistent.
[03:04:32.460 --> 03:04:35.980]   Now, the way it works is,
[03:04:35.980 --> 03:04:37.580]   okay, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
[03:04:37.580 --> 03:04:40.500]   What happens is the way space is knitted together
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:43.700]   in our theory of physics is through all these events.
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:48.060]   And the idea is that the way that economic space
[03:04:48.060 --> 03:04:52.340]   is knitted together is there these autonomous events
[03:04:52.340 --> 03:04:54.900]   that essentially knit together economic space.
[03:04:54.900 --> 03:04:56.580]   So there are all these threads of transactions
[03:04:56.580 --> 03:04:57.580]   that are happening.
[03:04:57.580 --> 03:04:59.500]   And the question is, can they be made consistent?
[03:04:59.500 --> 03:05:01.580]   Are there, is there something forcing them
[03:05:01.580 --> 03:05:05.540]   to be sort of a consistent fabric of economic reality?
[03:05:05.540 --> 03:05:07.740]   And sort of what this has led me to
[03:05:07.740 --> 03:05:11.380]   is trying to realize how does economics fundamentally work?
[03:05:11.380 --> 03:05:13.660]   And, you know, what is economics?
[03:05:13.660 --> 03:05:16.860]   And, you know, what are the atoms of economics,
[03:05:16.860 --> 03:05:17.780]   so to speak?
[03:05:17.780 --> 03:05:20.220]   And so what I've kind of realized is that,
[03:05:20.220 --> 03:05:22.620]   that sort of the, perhaps,
[03:05:22.620 --> 03:05:24.380]   I don't even know if this is right yet.
[03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:27.420]   There's sort of events in economics of transactions.
[03:05:27.420 --> 03:05:28.980]   There are states of agents
[03:05:28.980 --> 03:05:31.620]   that are kind of the atoms of economics.
[03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:34.740]   And then transactions are kind of agents
[03:05:34.740 --> 03:05:36.540]   transact in some,
[03:05:36.540 --> 03:05:38.700]   transact in some way, and that's an event.
[03:05:38.700 --> 03:05:39.860]   And then the question is,
[03:05:39.860 --> 03:05:43.420]   how do you knit together sort of economic space from that?
[03:05:43.420 --> 03:05:44.780]   What is there in economic space?
[03:05:44.780 --> 03:05:46.340]   Well, all these transactions,
[03:05:46.340 --> 03:05:47.820]   there's a whole complicated collection
[03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:48.820]   of possible transactions.
[03:05:48.820 --> 03:05:50.820]   But one thing that's true about economics
[03:05:50.820 --> 03:05:52.660]   is we tend to have the notion
[03:05:52.660 --> 03:05:54.300]   of a definite value for things.
[03:05:54.300 --> 03:05:57.580]   We could imagine that, you know,
[03:05:57.580 --> 03:06:01.700]   you buy a cookie from somebody
[03:06:01.700 --> 03:06:05.380]   and they want to get a movie ticket.
[03:06:05.380 --> 03:06:09.740]   And there is some way that AI bots could make some path
[03:06:09.740 --> 03:06:12.380]   from the cookie to the movie ticket
[03:06:12.380 --> 03:06:15.340]   by all these different intermediate transactions.
[03:06:15.340 --> 03:06:18.820]   But in fact, we have an approximation to that,
[03:06:18.820 --> 03:06:21.620]   which is we say they each have a dollar value.
[03:06:21.620 --> 03:06:24.180]   And we have this kind of numeraire concept
[03:06:24.180 --> 03:06:26.660]   of there's just a way of kind of,
[03:06:26.660 --> 03:06:29.940]   of taking this whole complicated space of transactions
[03:06:29.940 --> 03:06:31.980]   and parsing it in something
[03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:34.300]   which is a kind of a simplified thing
[03:06:34.300 --> 03:06:37.700]   that is kind of like a parsing of physical space.
[03:06:37.700 --> 03:06:42.220]   And so my guess is that the, yet again, I mean, it's crazy
[03:06:42.220 --> 03:06:44.180]   that all these things are so connected.
[03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:46.620]   This is another multi-computation story,
[03:06:46.620 --> 03:06:48.900]   another story of where what's happening
[03:06:48.900 --> 03:06:51.220]   is that the economic consciousness,
[03:06:51.220 --> 03:06:54.260]   the economic observer is not going to deal
[03:06:54.260 --> 03:06:56.780]   with all of those different microscopic transactions.
[03:06:56.780 --> 03:06:59.020]   They're just going to parse the whole thing by saying,
[03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:00.900]   there's this value, it's a number.
[03:07:00.900 --> 03:07:03.940]   And that's their understanding of their summary
[03:07:03.940 --> 03:07:05.460]   of this economic network.
[03:07:05.460 --> 03:07:06.900]   And there will be all kinds of things,
[03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:08.980]   like there are all kinds of arbitrage opportunities,
[03:07:08.980 --> 03:07:10.940]   which are kind of like the quantum effects
[03:07:10.940 --> 03:07:12.300]   in this whole thing.
[03:07:12.300 --> 03:07:15.940]   And that's, you know, and places where there's sort
[03:07:15.940 --> 03:07:18.940]   of different paths that can be followed and so on.
[03:07:18.940 --> 03:07:21.820]   And so the question is,
[03:07:21.820 --> 03:07:24.820]   can one make a sort of global theory of economics?
[03:07:24.820 --> 03:07:27.180]   And then my test case is, again,
[03:07:27.180 --> 03:07:29.580]   what is time dilation in economics?
[03:07:29.580 --> 03:07:31.500]   And I know for, you know,
[03:07:31.500 --> 03:07:33.500]   if you imagine a very agricultural economics
[03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:35.620]   where people are growing lettuces in fields
[03:07:35.620 --> 03:07:38.020]   and things like this, and you ask questions about,
[03:07:38.020 --> 03:07:41.020]   well, if you're transporting lettuces to different places,
[03:07:41.020 --> 03:07:43.100]   you know, what is the value of the lettuces
[03:07:43.100 --> 03:07:44.940]   after you have to transport them
[03:07:44.940 --> 03:07:47.660]   versus if you're just sitting in one place and selling them?
[03:07:47.660 --> 03:07:49.460]   And you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy there,
[03:07:49.460 --> 03:07:52.580]   but I think there's a better and more complete analogy.
[03:07:52.580 --> 03:07:53.620]   And that's the question of,
[03:07:53.620 --> 03:07:55.900]   is there a theory like general relativity
[03:07:55.900 --> 03:07:58.060]   that is a global theory of economics?
[03:07:58.060 --> 03:08:00.100]   And is it about something we care about?
[03:08:00.100 --> 03:08:01.540]   It could be that there is a global theory,
[03:08:01.540 --> 03:08:04.220]   but it's about a feature of economic reality
[03:08:04.220 --> 03:08:05.780]   that isn't important to us.
[03:08:05.780 --> 03:08:07.860]   Now, another part of the story is,
[03:08:07.860 --> 03:08:10.580]   can one use those ideas to make essentially
[03:08:10.580 --> 03:08:12.180]   a distributed blockchain,
[03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:14.820]   a distributed generalization of blockchain,
[03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:17.100]   kind of the quantum analog of money, so to speak,
[03:08:17.100 --> 03:08:19.460]   where you have, for example,
[03:08:19.460 --> 03:08:22.100]   you can have uncertainty relations where you're saying,
[03:08:22.100 --> 03:08:25.100]   you know, well, if I insist on knowing my bank account
[03:08:25.100 --> 03:08:27.740]   right now, there'll be some uncertainty.
[03:08:27.740 --> 03:08:29.660]   If I'm prepared to wait a while,
[03:08:29.660 --> 03:08:31.620]   then it'll be much more certain.
[03:08:31.620 --> 03:08:34.300]   And so there's, you know, is there a way of using,
[03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:37.740]   and so we've made a bunch of prototypes of this,
[03:08:37.740 --> 03:08:39.660]   which I'm not yet happy with,
[03:08:39.660 --> 03:08:41.180]   because what I realized is
[03:08:41.180 --> 03:08:42.620]   to really understand these prototypes,
[03:08:42.620 --> 03:08:45.260]   I actually have to have a foundational theory of economics.
[03:08:45.260 --> 03:08:47.100]   And so that's kind of a, you know,
[03:08:47.100 --> 03:08:49.820]   it may be that we could deploy one of these prototypes
[03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:51.180]   as a practical system,
[03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:52.620]   but I think it's really gonna be much better
[03:08:52.620 --> 03:08:54.460]   if we actually have an understanding
[03:08:54.460 --> 03:08:56.420]   of how this plugs into kind of the economic system.
[03:08:56.420 --> 03:08:58.500]   - And that means like a fundamental theory
[03:08:58.500 --> 03:09:01.500]   of transactions between entities.
[03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:02.740]   - Well, and how- - That's what you mean
[03:09:02.740 --> 03:09:03.900]   by economics.
[03:09:03.900 --> 03:09:04.780]   - Yes, I think so.
[03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:07.500]   But I mean, you know, how there emerge
[03:09:07.500 --> 03:09:08.620]   sort of laws of economics,
[03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:10.620]   I don't even know, and I've been asking friends of mine
[03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:14.300]   who are economists and things, what is economics?
[03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:16.140]   You know, is it an axiomatic theory?
[03:09:16.140 --> 03:09:18.140]   Is it a theory that is a kind of
[03:09:18.140 --> 03:09:20.580]   a qualitative description theory?
[03:09:20.580 --> 03:09:22.540]   Is it, you know, what kind of a theory is it?
[03:09:22.540 --> 03:09:24.660]   Is it a theory, you know, what kind of thinking?
[03:09:24.660 --> 03:09:28.140]   It's like in biology, in evolutionary biology, for example,
[03:09:28.140 --> 03:09:30.380]   there's a certain pattern of thinking
[03:09:30.380 --> 03:09:31.920]   that goes on in evolutionary biology,
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:35.100]   where if you're a good evolutionary biologist,
[03:09:35.100 --> 03:09:37.980]   somebody says, "That creature has a weird horn."
[03:09:37.980 --> 03:09:40.100]   And they'll say, "Well, that's because this and this
[03:09:40.100 --> 03:09:42.800]   "and this and this selection of this kind and that kind,
[03:09:42.800 --> 03:09:44.680]   "and that's the story."
[03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:46.340]   And it's not a mathematical story,
[03:09:46.340 --> 03:09:48.580]   it's a story of a different type of thinking
[03:09:48.580 --> 03:09:49.420]   about these things.
[03:09:49.420 --> 03:09:52.960]   By the way, evolutionary biology is yet another place
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:55.280]   where it looks like this multi-computational idea
[03:09:55.280 --> 03:09:56.420]   can be applied.
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:09:59.620]   And that's where maybe speciation is related
[03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:01.500]   to things like event horizons,
[03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:04.200]   and there's a whole other kind of world of that.
[03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:06.260]   But- - It seems like this kind of model
[03:10:06.260 --> 03:10:09.180]   can be applicable to so many aspects,
[03:10:09.180 --> 03:10:14.180]   like at the different levels of understanding of our reality.
[03:10:14.180 --> 03:10:16.720]   So it could be the biology, the chemistry,
[03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:19.600]   at the physics level, the economics,
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:21.480]   and you could potentially...
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:25.080]   The thing is, it's like, okay, sure,
[03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:26.560]   at all these levels, it might rhyme,
[03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:28.200]   it might make sense as a model.
[03:10:28.200 --> 03:10:30.640]   The question is, can you make useful predictions
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:32.040]   at one of these levels? - That's right.
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:35.600]   That's right, and that's really a question of...
[03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:37.620]   It's a weird situation, because it's a situation
[03:10:37.620 --> 03:10:41.800]   where the model probably has definite consequences.
[03:10:41.800 --> 03:10:44.560]   The question is, are they consequences we care about?
[03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:45.840]   And that's some...
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:50.300]   In the case of, in the economic case,
[03:10:50.300 --> 03:10:59.720]   so one thing is this idea of using physics-like notions
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:03.160]   to construct a distributed analog of blockchain.
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:05.520]   Okay, the much more pragmatic thing
[03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:07.320]   is a different direction,
[03:11:07.320 --> 03:11:09.360]   and it has to do with this computational language
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:11.280]   that we built to describe the world
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:14.160]   that knows about different kinds of cookies
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:15.760]   and knows about different cities
[03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:18.960]   and knows about how to compute all these kinds of things.
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:21.220]   One of the things that is of interest is,
[03:11:21.220 --> 03:11:23.220]   if you want to run the world,
[03:11:23.220 --> 03:11:27.720]   you need, with contracts and laws and rules and so on,
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:29.520]   there are rules at a human level,
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:31.960]   and there are kind of things like...
[03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:34.000]   And so this gets one into the idea
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000]   of computational contracts.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.080]   Right now, when we write a contract,
[03:11:38.080 --> 03:11:41.960]   it's a piece of legalese, it's just written in English,
[03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:43.880]   and it's not something that's automatically
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:45.760]   analyzable, executable, whatever else.
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:47.960]   It's just English.
[03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:52.960]   Back in Gottfried Leibniz, back in 1680 or whatever,
[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:57.560]   was like, "I'm gonna figure out how to use logic
[03:11:57.560 --> 03:11:59.600]   "to decide legal cases," and so on,
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:01.160]   and he had kind of this idea of,
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:05.480]   "Let's make a computational language for human law.
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:07.320]   "Forget about modeling nature,
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:09.960]   "forgot about natural laws, what about human law?
[03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:11.440]   "Can we make kind of a computational
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:13.160]   "representation of that?"
[03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:16.400]   Well, I think finally we're close to being able to do that,
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:18.720]   and one of the projects that I hope to get to
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:21.260]   as soon as there's a little bit of slowing down
[03:12:21.260 --> 03:12:23.800]   of some of this Cambrian explosion that's happening
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:26.360]   is a project I've been meaning to really do for a long time,
[03:12:26.360 --> 03:12:29.240]   which is what I'm calling a symbolic discourse language.
[03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:31.900]   It's just finishing the job of being able
[03:12:31.900 --> 03:12:35.400]   to represent everything, like the conversation we're having
[03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:38.800]   in computational terms, and one of the use cases for that
[03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:40.400]   is computational contracts.
[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:43.400]   Another use case is something like the Constitution
[03:12:43.400 --> 03:12:46.200]   that says what the AIs, what we want the AIs to do.
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:48.400]   - But this is useful, so you're saying,
[03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:50.980]   so these are like, you're saying computational contracts,
[03:12:50.980 --> 03:12:53.880]   but smart contracts, this is what's in the domain
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:12:56.080]   of cryptocurrencies known as smart contracts,
[03:12:56.080 --> 03:12:58.000]   and so the language you've developed,
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:01.480]   this symbolic or seek to further develop
[03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:04.200]   symbolic discourse language enables you
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:06.680]   to write a contract.
[03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:10.760]   - Write a contract that richly represents
[03:13:10.760 --> 03:13:12.160]   some aspect of the world, yeah.
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:15.500]   - But so, I mean, smart contracts tend to be right now
[03:13:15.500 --> 03:13:18.360]   mostly about things happening on the blockchain.
[03:13:18.360 --> 03:13:20.280]   Sometimes they have oracles, and in fact,
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:23.580]   Wolfram Alpha API is the main thing people use
[03:13:23.580 --> 03:13:26.360]   to get information about the real world, so to speak,
[03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:27.560]   within smart contracts.
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:31.000]   - So Wolfram Alpha, as it stands, is a really good oracle
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:32.440]   for whoever wants to use it.
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:34.800]   That's perhaps where the relationship with Cardano is.
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:36.600]   - Yeah, well, that's how we started getting involved
[03:13:36.600 --> 03:13:38.960]   with blockchains is we realized people were using,
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:41.200]   you know, Wolfram Alpha as the oracle
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:42.720]   for smart contracts, so to speak,
[03:13:42.720 --> 03:13:45.840]   and so that got us interested in blockchains in general,
[03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:49.480]   and what was ended up happening is Wolfram Language is,
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:51.240]   with its symbolic representation of things,
[03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:54.980]   is really very good at representing things like blockchains,
[03:13:54.980 --> 03:13:56.720]   and so I think we now have,
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:13:58.360]   and we don't really know all the comparisons,
[03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:00.240]   but we now have a really nice environment
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:03.900]   within Wolfram Language for dealing with the sort of,
[03:14:03.900 --> 03:14:06.280]   you know, for representing what happens in blockchains,
[03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:08.400]   for analyzing what happens in blockchains.
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:12.040]   We have a whole effort in blockchain analytics,
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:15.040]   and, you know, we've sort of published some samples
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:17.000]   of how that works, but it's, you know,
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.600]   because our technology stack, Wolfram Language
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:21.480]   and Mathematica, are very widely used
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.980]   in the quant finance world, there's a sort of immediate
[03:14:25.980 --> 03:14:29.360]   sort of co-evolution there of sort of
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:32.840]   the quant finance kind of thing, and blockchain analytics,
[03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:35.360]   and that's, so it's kind of the representation
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:37.640]   of blockchain in computational language,
[03:14:37.640 --> 03:14:39.800]   then ultimately, it's kind of like,
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:41.760]   how do you run the world with code?
[03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:44.460]   That is, how do you write sort of all these things
[03:14:44.460 --> 03:14:46.560]   which are right now regulations, and laws,
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:49.360]   and contracts, and things in computational language,
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:52.520]   and kind of the ultimate vision is that sort of
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:53.940]   something happens in the world,
[03:14:53.940 --> 03:14:55.840]   and then there's this giant domino effect
[03:14:55.840 --> 03:14:57.580]   of all these computational contracts
[03:14:57.580 --> 03:14:59.640]   that trigger based on the thing that happened,
[03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:01.720]   and there's a whole story to that,
[03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:05.080]   and of course, you know, I like to always pay attention
[03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:07.040]   to the latest things that are going on,
[03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:08.920]   and I really, I kind of like blockchain
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:13.400]   because it's another rethinking of kind of computation.
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:14.960]   It's kind of like, you know, cloud computing
[03:15:14.960 --> 03:15:18.000]   was a little bit of that, of sort of persistent
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:21.200]   kind of computational resources and so on,
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:23.120]   and, you know, this multi-computation
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:26.560]   is a big rethinking of kind of what it means to compute.
[03:15:26.560 --> 03:15:28.320]   Blockchain is another bit of rethinking
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:29.960]   of what it means to compute.
[03:15:29.960 --> 03:15:32.480]   The idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:35.600]   of computation out there in the blockchain world,
[03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:38.760]   and one of the things that just sort of,
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:41.160]   for fun, so to speak, is we've been doing a bit of stuff
[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:44.320]   with NFTs, and we just did some NFTs on Cardano,
[03:15:44.320 --> 03:15:45.680]   and we'll be doing some more,
[03:15:45.680 --> 03:15:48.520]   and, you know, we did some cellular automaton NFTs
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:51.920]   on Cardano, which people seem to like quite a bit,
[03:15:51.920 --> 03:15:55.280]   and, you know, one of the things I've realized about NFTs
[03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:57.240]   is that there's kind of this notion,
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:15:59.840]   and we're really working on this, you know,
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:02.400]   I like recording stuff, you know,
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:05.200]   one of the things that's come out of kind of my science,
[03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:09.120]   I suppose, is this history matters type story
[03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:10.680]   of, you know, it's not just the current stage,
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:12.080]   it's the history that matters,
[03:16:12.080 --> 03:16:14.280]   and I've kind of, I don't think this is,
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:16.840]   I should be realizing, maybe it's not coincidental
[03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:18.640]   that I'm sort of the human who's recorded
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:20.480]   more about themselves than anybody else,
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:22.720]   and then I end up with these science results
[03:16:22.720 --> 03:16:24.960]   that say history matters, which was not,
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:27.760]   those things, I didn't think those were connected, but--
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:29.400]   - They're at least correlated, yes.
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:31.720]   - Yeah, right, so, you know, this question
[03:16:31.720 --> 03:16:34.040]   about sort of recording what has happened,
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:36.980]   and having sort of a permanent record of things,
[03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:39.080]   one of the things that's kind of interesting there
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:40.440]   is, you know, you put up a website,
[03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:41.960]   and it's got a bunch of stuff on it,
[03:16:41.960 --> 03:16:43.800]   but, you know, you have to keep paying the hosting fees,
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:45.520]   or the thing's gonna go away,
[03:16:45.520 --> 03:16:47.200]   but one of the things about blockchain
[03:16:47.200 --> 03:16:48.960]   that's kind of interesting is,
[03:16:48.960 --> 03:16:50.400]   if you put something on a blockchain,
[03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:53.280]   and you pay, you know, your commission to get that thing,
[03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:56.880]   you know, put on, you know, mine, put on the blockchain,
[03:16:56.880 --> 03:17:01.120]   then, in a sense, everybody who comes after you is,
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:03.800]   you know, they are motivated to keep your thing alive,
[03:17:03.800 --> 03:17:06.340]   'cause that's what keeps the consistency of the blockchain.
[03:17:06.340 --> 03:17:08.700]   So, in a sense, with sort of the NFT world,
[03:17:08.700 --> 03:17:11.300]   it's kind of like, if you want to have something permanent,
[03:17:11.300 --> 03:17:13.440]   well, at least for the life of the blockchain,
[03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:16.520]   but even if the blockchain goes out of circulation,
[03:17:16.520 --> 03:17:18.580]   so to speak, there's gonna be enough value
[03:17:18.580 --> 03:17:20.800]   in that whole collection of transactions
[03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:22.520]   that people are gonna archive the thing,
[03:17:22.520 --> 03:17:25.000]   but that means that, you know, pay once,
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:28.120]   and you're kind of, you're lodged in the blockchain forever,
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:29.600]   and so we've been kind of playing around
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:32.520]   with sort of a hobby thing of mine,
[03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:35.400]   of thinking about sort of the NFTs,
[03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:39.100]   and how you, and sort of the consumer idea
[03:17:39.100 --> 03:17:41.880]   of kind of the, it's the anti, you know,
[03:17:41.880 --> 03:17:44.600]   it's the opposite of the Snapchat view of the world.
[03:17:44.600 --> 03:17:45.960]   - Sure, there's a permanence to it
[03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:48.120]   that's heavily incentivized,
[03:17:48.120 --> 03:17:52.880]   and thereby you can have a permanence of history.
[03:17:52.880 --> 03:17:56.280]   - Right, and that's kind of the, now, you know,
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:17:58.720]   so that's one of the things we've been doing with Cardano,
[03:17:58.720 --> 03:17:59.960]   and it's kind of fun.
[03:17:59.960 --> 03:18:02.480]   I think that, I mean, this whole question about,
[03:18:02.480 --> 03:18:04.280]   you know, you mentioned automated theorem proving,
[03:18:04.280 --> 03:18:06.160]   and blockchains, and so on,
[03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:08.480]   and as I've thought about this kind of physics-inspired
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:09.880]   distributed blockchain,
[03:18:09.880 --> 03:18:14.180]   obviously there, the sort of the proof that it works,
[03:18:14.180 --> 03:18:16.920]   that there are no double spends, there's no whatever else,
[03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:20.160]   that proof becomes a very formal kind of,
[03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:22.760]   almost a matter of physics, so to speak.
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:25.120]   And, you know, it's been an interesting thing
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:27.360]   for the practical blockchains
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:29.880]   to do kind of actual automated theorem proving,
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:31.640]   and I don't think anybody's really managed it
[03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:33.240]   in an interesting case yet.
[03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:35.760]   It's a thing that people, you know, aspire to,
[03:18:35.760 --> 03:18:37.580]   but I think it's a challenging thing,
[03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:39.200]   'cause basically the point is,
[03:18:39.200 --> 03:18:42.980]   one of the things about proving correctness of something
[03:18:42.980 --> 03:18:44.960]   is, well, you know, people say, "I've got this program,
[03:18:44.960 --> 03:18:46.600]   "and I'm going to prove it's correct."
[03:18:46.600 --> 03:18:47.880]   And it's like, what does that mean?
[03:18:47.880 --> 03:18:49.620]   You have to say what correct means.
[03:18:49.620 --> 03:18:50.980]   I mean, it's kind of like,
[03:18:50.980 --> 03:18:52.340]   then you have to have another language,
[03:18:52.340 --> 03:18:55.400]   and people were very confused back in past decades of,
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:18:57.560]   you know, "Oh, we're going to prove the correctness
[03:18:57.560 --> 03:19:00.220]   "by representing the program in another language,
[03:19:00.220 --> 03:19:02.480]   "which we also don't know whether it's correct."
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:04.120]   And, you know, often by correctness,
[03:19:04.120 --> 03:19:07.520]   we just mean it can't crash, or it can't scribble on memory,
[03:19:07.520 --> 03:19:10.760]   but the thing is that there's this complicated trade-off,
[03:19:10.760 --> 03:19:14.460]   because as soon as you're really using computation,
[03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:16.480]   you have computational irreducibility,
[03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:18.000]   you have undecidability.
[03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:20.620]   If you want to use computation seriously,
[03:19:20.620 --> 03:19:23.620]   you have to kind of let go of the idea
[03:19:23.620 --> 03:19:25.560]   that you're going to be able to box it in,
[03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:27.820]   and say, "We're going to have just this happen,
[03:19:27.820 --> 03:19:28.880]   "and not anything else."
[03:19:28.880 --> 03:19:30.800]   I mean, this is an old fact.
[03:19:30.800 --> 03:19:33.440]   I mean, Godel's theorem tries to say, you know,
[03:19:33.440 --> 03:19:35.800]   Peano arithmetic, the axioms of arithmetic,
[03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:37.800]   can you box in the integers,
[03:19:37.800 --> 03:19:39.880]   and say these axioms give just the integers,
[03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:41.320]   and nothing but the integers.
[03:19:41.320 --> 03:19:43.280]   Godel's theorem showed that wasn't the case.
[03:19:43.280 --> 03:19:45.560]   There's a, you know, you can have all these wild,
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:48.160]   weird things that obey the Peano axioms,
[03:19:48.160 --> 03:19:49.400]   but aren't integers.
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:51.520]   And there's this kind of infinite hierarchy
[03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:53.680]   of additional axioms you would have to add,
[03:19:53.680 --> 03:19:54.720]   and it's kind of the same thing.
[03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:57.680]   You don't get to, you know, if you want to say,
[03:19:57.680 --> 03:20:00.440]   "I want to know what happens," you're boxing yourself in,
[03:20:00.440 --> 03:20:02.640]   and there's a limit to what can happen, so to speak.
[03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:04.120]   So it's a complicated trade-off,
[03:20:04.120 --> 03:20:06.960]   and it's a big trade-off for AI, so to speak.
[03:20:06.960 --> 03:20:09.260]   It's kind of like, do you want to let computation
[03:20:09.260 --> 03:20:12.120]   actually do what it can do, or do you want to say,
[03:20:12.120 --> 03:20:14.000]   "No, it's very, very boxed in to the point
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:16.160]   "where we can understand every step?"
[03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:20.040]   And that's kind of a thing that becomes difficult to do.
[03:20:20.040 --> 03:20:22.720]   But that's some, I mean, in general,
[03:20:22.720 --> 03:20:25.580]   I would say one of the things that's kind of complicated
[03:20:25.580 --> 03:20:29.040]   in my sort of life and the whole sort of story
[03:20:29.040 --> 03:20:31.680]   of computational language and all this technology
[03:20:31.680 --> 03:20:34.400]   and science and so on, I mean, I kind of,
[03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:36.900]   in the flow of one's life, it's sort of interesting
[03:20:36.900 --> 03:20:38.880]   to see how these things play out,
[03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:41.180]   because I, you know, I've kind of concluded
[03:20:41.180 --> 03:20:43.720]   that I'm in the business of making kind of artifacts
[03:20:43.720 --> 03:20:46.440]   from the future, which means, you know,
[03:20:46.440 --> 03:20:48.320]   there are things that I've done, I don't know,
[03:20:48.320 --> 03:20:49.800]   this physics project, I don't know whether anybody
[03:20:49.800 --> 03:20:52.280]   would have gotten to it for 50 years.
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:20:53.680]   You know, the fact that Mathematica
[03:20:53.680 --> 03:20:56.240]   is a third of a century old, and I know
[03:20:56.240 --> 03:20:59.440]   that a bunch of the core ideas are not well-absorbed.
[03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:01.480]   I mean, that is, people finally got this idea
[03:21:01.480 --> 03:21:03.800]   that I thought was a triviality of notebooks.
[03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:05.420]   That was 25 years.
[03:21:05.420 --> 03:21:07.560]   And, you know, some of these core ideas
[03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:11.240]   about symbolic computation and so on are not absorbed.
[03:21:11.240 --> 03:21:15.300]   I mean, people use them every day in Wolfram Language
[03:21:15.300 --> 03:21:17.120]   and, you know, do all kinds of cool things with them,
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:19.100]   but if you say, what is the fundamental
[03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:22.560]   intellectual point here, it's not well-absorbed.
[03:21:22.560 --> 03:21:24.600]   And it's something where you kind of realize
[03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:26.400]   that you're sort of building things,
[03:21:26.400 --> 03:21:29.340]   and I kind of made this thing about, you know,
[03:21:29.340 --> 03:21:31.080]   we're building artifacts from the future, so to speak,
[03:21:31.080 --> 03:21:34.480]   and I mentioned that at our, we have a conference,
[03:21:34.480 --> 03:21:36.080]   it's coming up actually in a couple of weeks,
[03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:38.740]   our annual technology conference,
[03:21:38.740 --> 03:21:41.660]   where we talk about all the things we're doing.
[03:21:41.660 --> 03:21:44.600]   And, you know, so I was talking about it last year
[03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:46.680]   about, you know, we're making artifacts from the future,
[03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:49.620]   and I was kind of like, I had some version of that
[03:21:49.620 --> 03:21:52.540]   that was kind of a dark and frustrated thing of like,
[03:21:52.540 --> 03:21:54.740]   you know, I'm building things which nobody's gonna care
[03:21:54.740 --> 03:21:57.040]   about until long after I'm dead, so to speak.
[03:21:57.040 --> 03:22:01.780]   But then I realized, you know, people were sort of telling
[03:22:01.780 --> 03:22:05.180]   me afterwards, you know, that's exactly how, you know,
[03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:07.560]   we're using Wolfram Language in some particular setting
[03:22:07.560 --> 03:22:10.620]   in some computational X field or some organization
[03:22:10.620 --> 03:22:13.020]   or whatever, and it's like people are saying,
[03:22:13.020 --> 03:22:15.280]   oh, you know, what did you manage to do?
[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:16.940]   You know, well, we know that in principle
[03:22:16.940 --> 03:22:18.020]   it will be possible to do that,
[03:22:18.020 --> 03:22:20.220]   but we didn't know that was possible now,
[03:22:20.220 --> 03:22:22.820]   and it's kind of like that's sort of the business we're in,
[03:22:22.820 --> 03:22:25.740]   and in a sense, with some of these ideas in science,
[03:22:25.740 --> 03:22:27.440]   you know, I feel a little bit the same way,
[03:22:27.440 --> 03:22:29.740]   that there are some of these things where, you know,
[03:22:29.740 --> 03:22:33.380]   some things, like for example, this whole idea,
[03:22:33.380 --> 03:22:36.740]   well, so to relate to another sort of piece of history
[03:22:36.740 --> 03:22:38.980]   and the future, one of, you know, I mentioned,
[03:22:38.980 --> 03:22:41.460]   we mentioned at the beginning kind of complexity
[03:22:41.460 --> 03:22:44.060]   as this thing that I was interested in back 40 years ago
[03:22:44.060 --> 03:22:46.540]   and so on, where does complexity come from?
[03:22:46.540 --> 03:22:48.860]   Well, I think we kind of nailed that.
[03:22:48.860 --> 03:22:51.260]   The answer is in the computational universe,
[03:22:51.260 --> 03:22:54.300]   even simple programs make it, and that's kind of the secret
[03:22:54.300 --> 03:22:56.460]   that nature has that allows you to make it.
[03:22:56.460 --> 03:22:59.860]   So that's kind of the, that's that part,
[03:22:59.860 --> 03:23:02.220]   but the bigger picture there was this idea
[03:23:02.220 --> 03:23:04.220]   of this kind of computational paradigm,
[03:23:04.220 --> 03:23:06.820]   the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equations,
[03:23:06.820 --> 03:23:09.860]   which have been sort of the primary modeling medium
[03:23:09.860 --> 03:23:13.160]   for 300 years, and so it was like, look,
[03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:16.380]   it is inexorably the case that people will use programs
[03:23:16.380 --> 03:23:18.460]   rather than just equations, and you know,
[03:23:18.460 --> 03:23:21.260]   I was saying that in the 1980s, and people were,
[03:23:21.260 --> 03:23:23.540]   you know, I published my big book, "New Kind of Science,"
[03:23:23.540 --> 03:23:27.580]   that'll be 20 years ago next year, so in 2002,
[03:23:27.580 --> 03:23:30.260]   and people were saying, oh no, this can't possibly be true,
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:31.940]   you know, we know for 300 years,
[03:23:31.940 --> 03:23:33.860]   we've been doing all this stuff, right?
[03:23:33.860 --> 03:23:37.160]   To be fair, I now realize, on a little bit more analysis
[03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:40.620]   of what people actually said, in pretty much every field
[03:23:40.620 --> 03:23:44.120]   other than physics, people said, oh, these are new models,
[03:23:44.120 --> 03:23:47.400]   that's pretty interesting, and physics, people were like,
[03:23:47.400 --> 03:23:49.900]   we've got our physics models, we're very happy with them.
[03:23:49.900 --> 03:23:51.740]   - Yeah, in physics, there's more resistance
[03:23:51.740 --> 03:23:54.820]   because of the attachment and the power of the equations.
[03:23:54.820 --> 03:23:57.540]   The idea that programs might be the right way
[03:23:57.540 --> 03:24:01.620]   to approach this field was, there's some resistance,
[03:24:01.620 --> 03:24:04.300]   and like you're saying, it takes time.
[03:24:04.300 --> 03:24:06.860]   For somebody who likes the idea of time dilation
[03:24:06.860 --> 03:24:08.100]   and all these applications,
[03:24:08.100 --> 03:24:09.700]   I thought you would understand this.
[03:24:09.700 --> 03:24:10.980]   - Yeah, right, but you know,
[03:24:10.980 --> 03:24:12.700]   and computational irreducibility as well.
[03:24:12.700 --> 03:24:13.900]   - Yes, exactly.
[03:24:13.900 --> 03:24:17.380]   - But I mean, it is really interesting that just 20 years,
[03:24:17.380 --> 03:24:20.300]   the span of 20 years, it's gone from, you know,
[03:24:20.300 --> 03:24:24.380]   pitchforks and horror to, yeah, we get it,
[03:24:24.380 --> 03:24:27.540]   and you know, it's helped that we've, you know,
[03:24:27.540 --> 03:24:30.880]   in our current effort in fundamental physics,
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:32.020]   we've gotten a lot further,
[03:24:32.020 --> 03:24:35.260]   and we've managed to put a lot of puzzle pieces together
[03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:36.580]   that make sense.
[03:24:36.580 --> 03:24:38.540]   But the thing that I've been thinking about recently
[03:24:38.540 --> 03:24:39.980]   is this field of complexity.
[03:24:39.980 --> 03:24:43.740]   So I've kind of was a sort of a field builder
[03:24:43.740 --> 03:24:44.860]   back in the 1980s.
[03:24:44.860 --> 03:24:49.100]   I was kind of like, okay, you know, can we, you know,
[03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:50.540]   I'd understood this point
[03:24:50.540 --> 03:24:52.180]   that there was this sort of fundamental phenomenon
[03:24:52.180 --> 03:24:54.540]   of complexity, and it showed up in lots of places.
[03:24:54.540 --> 03:24:55.380]   And I was like,
[03:24:55.380 --> 03:24:58.020]   this is an interesting sort of field of science.
[03:24:58.020 --> 03:25:01.560]   And I was recently was reminded,
[03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:04.800]   I was at this, the very first sort of get together
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:07.280]   of what became the Santa Fe Institute.
[03:25:07.280 --> 03:25:09.200]   I was like, in fact, there's even an audio recording
[03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:11.640]   of me sort of saying, people have been talking about,
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:13.520]   oh, what should this, you know, outfit do?
[03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:15.920]   And I was saying, well, there is this thing
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:16.840]   that I've been thinking about.
[03:25:16.840 --> 03:25:18.880]   It's this kind of idea of complexity.
[03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:22.640]   And it's kind of like, and that's what that ended up.
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:25.080]   - And you planted the seed of complexity at Santa Fe.
[03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:25.920]   That's beautiful.
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:26.760]   That's a beautiful vision.
[03:25:26.760 --> 03:25:29.460]   - But, I mean, so that, but what's happened then
[03:25:29.460 --> 03:25:32.180]   is this idea of complexity and, you know,
[03:25:32.180 --> 03:25:34.660]   and I started the first research center
[03:25:34.660 --> 03:25:36.100]   at University of Illinois for doing that
[03:25:36.100 --> 03:25:39.080]   in the first journal, complex systems and so on.
[03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:42.820]   And it's kind of an interesting thing in my life,
[03:25:42.820 --> 03:25:45.460]   at least that it's kind of like you plant the seed,
[03:25:45.460 --> 03:25:48.660]   you have this idea, it's a kind of a science idea.
[03:25:48.660 --> 03:25:50.220]   You have this idea of sort of focusing
[03:25:50.220 --> 03:25:52.020]   on the phenomenon of complexity.
[03:25:52.020 --> 03:25:54.820]   The deeper idea was this computational paradigm.
[03:25:54.820 --> 03:25:58.040]   But the nominal idea is this kind of idea of complexity.
[03:25:58.040 --> 03:26:01.280]   Okay, then you roll time forward 30 years or whatever,
[03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:05.460]   35 years, whatever it is, and you say, what happened?
[03:26:05.460 --> 03:26:06.680]   Okay, well, now there are a thousand
[03:26:06.680 --> 03:26:09.280]   complexity institutes around the world.
[03:26:09.280 --> 03:26:12.120]   I think more or less, we've been trying to count them.
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:16.340]   And, you know, there are 40 complexity journals, I think.
[03:26:16.340 --> 03:26:19.360]   And so it's kind of like what actually happened
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:20.920]   in this field, right?
[03:26:20.920 --> 03:26:22.820]   And I look at a lot of what happened
[03:26:22.820 --> 03:26:25.680]   and I'm like, you know, I have to admit
[03:26:25.680 --> 03:26:27.940]   to some eye rolling, so to speak,
[03:26:27.940 --> 03:26:31.880]   because it's kind of like, what's actually going on?
[03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:34.100]   Well, what people definitely got
[03:26:34.100 --> 03:26:36.640]   was this idea of computational models.
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:38.440]   And then they got, but they thought,
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:41.520]   one of the kind of cognitive mistakes I think is,
[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:43.960]   they say, we've got a computational model
[03:26:43.960 --> 03:26:48.480]   and we're looking at a system that's complex
[03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:51.280]   and our computational model gives complexity.
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:53.580]   By golly, that must mean it's right.
[03:26:53.580 --> 03:26:55.960]   And unfortunately, because complexity
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:26:58.840]   is a generic phenomenon and computational irreducibility
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:01.960]   is a generic phenomenon that actually tells you nothing.
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:04.680]   And so then the question is, well, what can you do?
[03:27:04.680 --> 03:27:06.180]   You know, there's a lot of things
[03:27:06.180 --> 03:27:08.440]   that have been sort of done under this banner of complexity.
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:10.080]   I think it's been very successful
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:12.800]   in providing sort of an interdisciplinary way
[03:27:12.800 --> 03:27:14.600]   of connecting different fields together.
[03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:16.000]   - Which is powerful in itself.
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:16.840]   - Right, I mean, it's a very useful--
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:18.920]   - Biology and economics and yeah, it is.
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:20.640]   - Right, it's a good organizing principle.
[03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:22.880]   But in the end, a lot of that is around
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:25.560]   this sort of computational paradigm, computational modeling.
[03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:27.760]   That's the raw material that powers
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:30.520]   that kind of correspondence, I think.
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:32.560]   But the question is sort of what is the,
[03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:34.520]   you know, I was just thinking recently,
[03:27:34.520 --> 03:27:36.600]   you know, we've been, I mean, the other,
[03:27:36.600 --> 03:27:39.400]   we've been, for years people have told me,
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:41.200]   you should start some Wolfram Institute
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:42.880]   that does basic science.
[03:27:42.880 --> 03:27:45.600]   You know, all I have is a company that builds software
[03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:47.400]   and we, you know, we have a little piece
[03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:49.400]   that does basic science as kind of a hobby.
[03:27:49.400 --> 03:27:50.840]   People are saying, you should start
[03:27:50.840 --> 03:27:52.640]   this Wolfram Institute thing.
[03:27:52.640 --> 03:27:54.320]   And I've been, you know, 'cause I've known
[03:27:54.320 --> 03:27:56.000]   about lots of institutes and I've seen kind of
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:58.160]   that flow of money and kind of, you know,
[03:27:58.160 --> 03:28:00.200]   what happens in different situations and so on.
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:03.920]   So I've been kind of reluctant, but I have realized
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:05.840]   that, you know, what we've done with our company
[03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:07.480]   over the last 35 years, you know,
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:10.600]   we built a very good machine for doing R&D
[03:28:10.600 --> 03:28:12.920]   and, you know, innovating and creating things.
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:16.120]   And I just applied that machine to the physics project.
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:17.680]   That's how we did the physics project
[03:28:17.680 --> 03:28:20.560]   in a fairly short amount of time with a, you know,
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:22.640]   efficient machine with, you know,
[03:28:22.640 --> 03:28:25.040]   various people involved and so on.
[03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:28.000]   And so, you know, it works for basic science
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:30.360]   and it's like, we can do more of this.
[03:28:30.360 --> 03:28:32.200]   And so now-- - In biology and chemistry,
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:34.600]   so it's become an institute.
[03:28:34.600 --> 03:28:36.280]   - Yes, well, it needs to become an institute.
[03:28:36.280 --> 03:28:37.840]   - An official institute. - Right, right.
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:40.120]   But the thing that, so I was thinking about,
[03:28:40.120 --> 03:28:42.800]   okay, so what do we do with complexity?
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:45.440]   You know, what, there are all these people who've,
[03:28:45.440 --> 03:28:47.640]   you know, what should happen to that field?
[03:28:47.640 --> 03:28:50.040]   And what I realized is there's kind of this area
[03:28:50.040 --> 03:28:53.560]   of foundations of complexity that's about these questions
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:55.560]   about simple programs, what they do,
[03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:58.000]   that's far away from a bunch of the detailed applications
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:28:59.520]   that people, well, it's not far away.
[03:28:59.520 --> 03:29:01.560]   It's the under, you know,
[03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:04.480]   the bedrock underneath those applications.
[03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:05.640]   And so I realized recently,
[03:29:05.640 --> 03:29:10.400]   this is my recent kind of little innovation of a sort,
[03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:12.720]   a post that I'll do very soon,
[03:29:13.920 --> 03:29:18.920]   about kind of, you know, the foundations of complexity,
[03:29:18.920 --> 03:29:20.320]   what really are they?
[03:29:20.320 --> 03:29:23.880]   I think they're really two ideas, two conceptual ideas
[03:29:23.880 --> 03:29:26.680]   that I hadn't really enunciated, I think, before.
[03:29:26.680 --> 03:29:30.200]   One is what I call metamodeling, the other is ruleology.
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:31.400]   So what is metamodeling?
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:34.160]   So metamodeling is, you've got this complicated model,
[03:29:34.160 --> 03:29:36.680]   and it's a model of, you know, hedgehogs interacting
[03:29:36.680 --> 03:29:38.640]   with this, interacting with that.
[03:29:38.640 --> 03:29:40.840]   And the question is, what's really underneath that?
[03:29:40.840 --> 03:29:41.880]   What is it?
[03:29:41.880 --> 03:29:43.600]   You know, is it a Turing machine?
[03:29:43.600 --> 03:29:45.240]   Is it a cellular automaton?
[03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:47.800]   You know, what is the underlying stuff
[03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:49.120]   underneath that model?
[03:29:49.120 --> 03:29:52.120]   And so there's this kind of meta-science question
[03:29:52.120 --> 03:29:55.440]   of, given these models, what is the core model?
[03:29:55.440 --> 03:29:56.760]   And I realized, I mean, to me,
[03:29:56.760 --> 03:29:58.440]   that's sort of an obvious question,
[03:29:58.440 --> 03:30:00.520]   but then I realized I've been doing language design
[03:30:00.520 --> 03:30:03.960]   for 40 years, and language design is exactly that question.
[03:30:03.960 --> 03:30:06.840]   You know, underneath all of this detailed stuff people do,
[03:30:06.840 --> 03:30:08.800]   what are the underlying primitives?
[03:30:08.800 --> 03:30:11.040]   And that's a question people haven't tended to ask
[03:30:11.040 --> 03:30:12.000]   about models.
[03:30:12.000 --> 03:30:13.280]   They say, "Well, we've got this nice model
[03:30:13.280 --> 03:30:14.520]   for this and that and the other.
[03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:16.120]   What's really underneath it?
[03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:18.520]   And what, you know, because once you have the thing
[03:30:18.520 --> 03:30:20.840]   that's underneath it, well, for example,
[03:30:20.840 --> 03:30:22.600]   this multi-computation idea
[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:24.760]   is an ultimate metamodeling idea,
[03:30:24.760 --> 03:30:27.240]   because it's saying underneath all these fields
[03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:29.720]   is one kind of paradigmatic structure.
[03:30:29.720 --> 03:30:32.080]   And, you know, you can imagine the same kind of thing
[03:30:32.080 --> 03:30:36.840]   in much more sort of, much sort of shallower levels
[03:30:36.840 --> 03:30:38.960]   in different kinds of modeling.
[03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:41.880]   So the first activity is this kind of metamodeling,
[03:30:41.880 --> 03:30:45.920]   the kind of the models about models, so to speak.
[03:30:45.920 --> 03:30:48.000]   You know, what is the, what's, you know,
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:49.920]   drilling down into models?
[03:30:49.920 --> 03:30:50.840]   That's one thing.
[03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:53.240]   The other thing is this thing that I think
[03:30:53.240 --> 03:30:54.920]   we're going to call ruleology,
[03:30:54.920 --> 03:30:57.760]   which is kind of the, okay, you've got these simple rules.
[03:30:57.760 --> 03:30:59.800]   You've got cellular automata, you've got Turing machines,
[03:30:59.800 --> 03:31:01.160]   you've got substitution systems,
[03:31:01.160 --> 03:31:02.400]   you've got register machines,
[03:31:02.400 --> 03:31:03.440]   you've got all these different things.
[03:31:03.440 --> 03:31:05.960]   What do they actually do in the wild?
[03:31:05.960 --> 03:31:08.920]   And this is an area that I've spent a lot of time,
[03:31:08.920 --> 03:31:09.840]   you know, working on.
[03:31:09.840 --> 03:31:11.800]   It's a lot of stuff in my new kind of science book
[03:31:11.800 --> 03:31:13.440]   is about this.
[03:31:13.440 --> 03:31:15.360]   You know, this new book I wrote about combinators
[03:31:15.360 --> 03:31:17.560]   is full of stuff like this.
[03:31:17.560 --> 03:31:19.720]   And this journal, "Complex Systems,"
[03:31:19.720 --> 03:31:21.960]   has lots of papers about these kinds of things.
[03:31:21.960 --> 03:31:23.920]   But there isn't really a home
[03:31:23.920 --> 03:31:26.360]   for people who do ruleology or whatever.
[03:31:26.360 --> 03:31:29.640]   - As you call the basic science of rules.
[03:31:29.640 --> 03:31:31.000]   - Yes, yes, right.
[03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:34.120]   So it's like you've got some, what is it?
[03:31:34.120 --> 03:31:35.100]   Is it mathematics?
[03:31:35.100 --> 03:31:36.440]   No, it isn't really like mathematics.
[03:31:36.440 --> 03:31:39.120]   In fact, from my now understanding of metamathematics,
[03:31:39.120 --> 03:31:41.840]   I understand that it's the molecular dynamics level.
[03:31:41.840 --> 03:31:43.920]   It's not the level that mathematicians
[03:31:43.920 --> 03:31:45.480]   have traditionally cared about.
[03:31:45.480 --> 03:31:47.040]   It's not computer science,
[03:31:47.040 --> 03:31:48.960]   because computer science is about writing programs
[03:31:48.960 --> 03:31:51.560]   that do things, you know, that were for a purpose,
[03:31:51.560 --> 03:31:53.920]   not programs in the wild, so to speak.
[03:31:53.920 --> 03:31:54.760]   It's not physics.
[03:31:54.760 --> 03:31:56.320]   It doesn't have anything to do with, you know,
[03:31:56.320 --> 03:31:57.760]   it may be underneath some physics,
[03:31:57.760 --> 03:31:59.520]   but it's not physics as such.
[03:31:59.520 --> 03:32:01.280]   So it just hasn't had a home.
[03:32:01.280 --> 03:32:02.880]   And if you look at, you know,
[03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:07.040]   but what's great about it is it's a surviving field,
[03:32:07.040 --> 03:32:07.880]   so to speak.
[03:32:07.880 --> 03:32:08.920]   It's something where, you know,
[03:32:08.920 --> 03:32:11.640]   one of the things I find sort of inspiring
[03:32:11.640 --> 03:32:13.520]   about mathematics, for example,
[03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:15.480]   is you look at mathematics that was done,
[03:32:15.480 --> 03:32:17.480]   you know, in ancient Greece, ancient, you know,
[03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:19.480]   Babylon, Egypt, and so on.
[03:32:19.480 --> 03:32:20.800]   It's still here today.
[03:32:20.800 --> 03:32:22.320]   You know, you find an icosahedron
[03:32:22.320 --> 03:32:24.720]   that somebody made in ancient Egypt.
[03:32:24.720 --> 03:32:27.080]   You look at it, oh, that's a very modern thing.
[03:32:27.080 --> 03:32:28.480]   It's an icosahedron.
[03:32:28.480 --> 03:32:31.680]   You know, it's a timeless kind of activity.
[03:32:31.680 --> 03:32:34.680]   And this idea of studying simple rules and what they do,
[03:32:34.680 --> 03:32:36.240]   it's a timeless activity.
[03:32:36.240 --> 03:32:38.800]   And I can see that over the last 40 years or so,
[03:32:38.800 --> 03:32:41.600]   as, you know, even with cellular automata,
[03:32:41.600 --> 03:32:43.040]   it's kind of like, you know,
[03:32:43.040 --> 03:32:45.200]   you can sort of catalog what are the different
[03:32:45.200 --> 03:32:47.080]   cellular automata used for,
[03:32:47.080 --> 03:32:49.160]   and, you know, like the simplest rules,
[03:32:49.160 --> 03:32:52.600]   like one, you might even know this one, rule 184.
[03:32:52.600 --> 03:32:56.200]   It's rule 184 is a minimal model for road traffic flow.
[03:32:56.200 --> 03:32:57.720]   And, you know, it's also a minimal model
[03:32:57.720 --> 03:32:58.960]   for various other things.
[03:32:58.960 --> 03:33:01.280]   But it's kind of fun that you can literally say,
[03:33:01.280 --> 03:33:03.840]   you know, rule 90 is a minimal model
[03:33:03.840 --> 03:33:05.320]   for this and this and this.
[03:33:05.320 --> 03:33:07.800]   Rule four is a minimal model for this.
[03:33:07.800 --> 03:33:10.000]   And it's kind of remarkable that you can just,
[03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:13.360]   by in this raw level of this kind of study of rules,
[03:33:13.360 --> 03:33:16.160]   they then branch, they're the raw material
[03:33:16.160 --> 03:33:18.000]   that you can use to make models of different things.
[03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:20.920]   So it's a very pure basic science,
[03:33:20.920 --> 03:33:23.320]   but it's one that, you know, people have explored it,
[03:33:23.320 --> 03:33:26.000]   but they've been kind of a little bit in the wilderness.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:27.440]   And I think, you know, one of the things
[03:33:27.440 --> 03:33:30.920]   that I would like to do finally is, you know,
[03:33:30.920 --> 03:33:33.560]   I always thought that sort of this notion of pure
[03:33:33.560 --> 03:33:36.800]   and chaos pure and chaos being the acronym for my book,
[03:33:36.800 --> 03:33:40.800]   "New Kind of Science" was something
[03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:41.920]   that people should be doing.
[03:33:41.920 --> 03:33:43.600]   And, you know, we tried to figure out
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:45.960]   what's the right institutional structure to do this stuff.
[03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:48.360]   You know, we dealt with a bunch of universities.
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:50.000]   Oh, you know, can we do this here?
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:51.320]   Well, what department would it be in?
[03:33:51.320 --> 03:33:52.560]   Well, it isn't in a department.
[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:54.480]   It's its own new kind of thing.
[03:33:54.480 --> 03:33:58.360]   That's why the book was called "A New Kind of Science."
[03:33:58.360 --> 03:34:01.080]   It's kind of the, because that's an increasingly
[03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:03.240]   good description of what it is, so to speak.
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:05.160]   We're actually, we were thinking about kind
[03:34:05.160 --> 03:34:08.640]   of the ruleological society, because we're realizing
[03:34:08.640 --> 03:34:11.080]   that it's kind of, it's, you know,
[03:34:11.080 --> 03:34:13.320]   there's a, it's very interesting.
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:15.080]   I mean, I've never really done something like this before,
[03:34:15.080 --> 03:34:17.680]   because there's this whole group of researchers
[03:34:17.680 --> 03:34:20.720]   who've been doing things that are really,
[03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:24.240]   in some cases, very elegant, very surviving, very solid.
[03:34:24.240 --> 03:34:26.240]   You know, here's this thing that happens
[03:34:26.240 --> 03:34:28.120]   in this very abstract system.
[03:34:28.120 --> 03:34:31.240]   But it's like, what is that part of?
[03:34:31.240 --> 03:34:33.960]   You know, it doesn't have a home.
[03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:35.560]   And I think that's something, you know,
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:38.040]   I kind of fault myself for not having been more,
[03:34:38.040 --> 03:34:40.440]   you know, when complexity was developing in the '80s,
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:45.440]   I didn't understand the danger of applications.
[03:34:45.440 --> 03:34:47.640]   That is, it's really cool that you can apply this
[03:34:47.640 --> 03:34:50.200]   to economics, and you can apply it to evolutionary biology,
[03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:51.600]   and this and that and the other.
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:53.920]   But what happens with applications is everything
[03:34:53.920 --> 03:34:55.920]   gets sucked into the applications.
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:58.760]   And the pure stuff, it's like the pure mathematics,
[03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:01.000]   there isn't any pure mathematics, so to speak.
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:03.320]   It's all just applications of mathematics.
[03:35:03.320 --> 03:35:05.800]   And I failed to kind of make sure
[03:35:05.800 --> 03:35:07.800]   that this kind of pure area
[03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:11.440]   was kind of maintained and developed.
[03:35:11.440 --> 03:35:12.840]   And I think now, you know,
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:14.760]   one of the things I want to try to do,
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:16.240]   and you know, it's a funny thing,
[03:35:16.240 --> 03:35:19.360]   because I'm used to, look, I've been a tech CEO
[03:35:19.360 --> 03:35:20.640]   for more than half my life now.
[03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:23.120]   So, you know, this is what I know how to do.
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:26.480]   And, you know, I can make stuff happen
[03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:27.760]   and get projects to happen,
[03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:30.200]   even as it turns out basic science projects
[03:35:30.200 --> 03:35:31.520]   in that kind of setting,
[03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:35.040]   and how that translates into kind of, you know,
[03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:36.600]   there are a lot of people working on, for example,
[03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:38.160]   our physics project sort of distributed
[03:35:38.160 --> 03:35:40.560]   through the academic world, and that's working just great.
[03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:41.480]   But the question is, you know,
[03:35:41.480 --> 03:35:44.640]   can we have a sort of accelerator mechanism
[03:35:44.640 --> 03:35:46.600]   that makes use of kind of what we've learned
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:49.320]   in sort of R&D innovation?
[03:35:49.320 --> 03:35:50.880]   And, you know, but on the other hand,
[03:35:50.880 --> 03:35:53.040]   it's a funny thing because, you know,
[03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:56.680]   in a company, in the end, the thing is, you know,
[03:35:56.680 --> 03:35:57.960]   it's a company, it makes products,
[03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:00.680]   it sells things to people.
[03:36:00.680 --> 03:36:02.440]   And, you know, when you're doing basic research,
[03:36:02.440 --> 03:36:04.840]   one of the challenges is there isn't that same kind
[03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:06.960]   of sort of mechanism.
[03:36:06.960 --> 03:36:10.040]   And so it's, you know, how do you drive the thing
[03:36:10.040 --> 03:36:12.920]   in a kind of, in a lead kind of way
[03:36:12.920 --> 03:36:15.160]   so that it really can make forward progress
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:17.840]   rather than, you know, what can often happen in,
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:20.240]   you know, in academic settings where it's like,
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:21.640]   well, there are all these flowers blooming,
[03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:24.520]   but it's not clear that they're, you know, that it's-
[03:36:24.520 --> 03:36:27.320]   - You have to have a central mission and a drive,
[03:36:27.320 --> 03:36:28.920]   just like you do with a company
[03:36:28.920 --> 03:36:31.360]   that's delivering a big overarching product.
[03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:32.840]   And that's- - Right.
[03:36:32.840 --> 03:36:34.960]   But the challenge is, you know, when you have a,
[03:36:34.960 --> 03:36:39.000]   the economics of the world are such that, you know,
[03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:40.600]   when you're delivering a product and people say,
[03:36:40.600 --> 03:36:42.800]   "Wow, that's useful, we'll buy it."
[03:36:42.800 --> 03:36:44.480]   And then that kind of feeds back and, okay,
[03:36:44.480 --> 03:36:48.080]   then you can pay the people who build it to eat,
[03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:50.120]   you know, so they can eat and so on.
[03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:55.120]   And with basic science, the payoff is very much less visible
[03:36:55.760 --> 03:36:57.520]   and, you know, with this physics project, as I say,
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:00.680]   the big surprise has been that, I mean, you know,
[03:37:00.680 --> 03:37:03.400]   for example, well, the big surprise with the physics project
[03:37:03.400 --> 03:37:07.120]   is that it looks like it has near-term applications.
[03:37:07.120 --> 03:37:10.160]   And I was like, I'm guessing this is 200 years away.
[03:37:10.160 --> 03:37:13.520]   It's, I was kind of using the analogy of, you know,
[03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:16.920]   Newton starting a satellite launch company,
[03:37:16.920 --> 03:37:19.440]   which would have been kind of wrong time.
[03:37:19.440 --> 03:37:22.360]   And, you know, but it turns out that's not the case,
[03:37:22.360 --> 03:37:23.960]   but we can't guarantee that.
[03:37:23.960 --> 03:37:27.160]   And if you say we're signing up to do basic research,
[03:37:27.160 --> 03:37:30.560]   basic rheology, let's say, and, you know,
[03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:33.120]   and we can't, we don't know the horizon, you know,
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:34.560]   it's an unknown horizon.
[03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:37.120]   It's kind of like an undecidable kind of proposition
[03:37:37.120 --> 03:37:39.540]   of when is this proof going to end, so to speak?
[03:37:39.540 --> 03:37:43.280]   When is it going to be something that gets applied?
[03:37:43.280 --> 03:37:45.660]   - Well, I hope this is,
[03:37:45.660 --> 03:37:48.520]   this becomes a vibrant new field of rheology.
[03:37:48.520 --> 03:37:49.360]   I love it.
[03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:50.720]   Like I told you many, many times,
[03:37:50.720 --> 03:37:54.280]   it's one of the most amazing ideas
[03:37:54.280 --> 03:37:55.720]   that has been brought to this world.
[03:37:55.720 --> 03:37:59.980]   So I hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world.
[03:37:59.980 --> 03:38:02.920]   Thank you once again
[03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:05.880]   for spending your really valuable time with me today.
[03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:06.840]   - Fun stuff.
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:07.680]   Thank you.
[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:10.120]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:38:10.120 --> 03:38:11.400]   with Stephen Wolfram.
[03:38:11.400 --> 03:38:12.600]   To support this podcast,

[03:38:15.360 --> 03:38:17.540]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:38:17.540 --> 03:38:19.400]   from Richard Feynman.
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:22.680]   "Nature uses only the longest threads
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:24.360]   "to weave her patterns.
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:27.080]   "So each small piece of her fabric
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:30.260]   "reveals the organization of the entire tapestry."
[03:38:30.260 --> 03:38:34.000]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:36.580]   (upbeat music)
[03:38:36.580 --> 03:38:39.160]   (upbeat music)
