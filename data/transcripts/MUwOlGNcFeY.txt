[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.160]   This one comes from EA. EA says, "Is the monastic life the ultimate deep life, and
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.920]   what can we learn and implement from it?" EA elaborates, "Lately I have been studying
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.240]   monasticism, especially the Benedictine order and their rule. Their motto is 'Ora
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.600]   e labora' - pray and work. Traditionally they focus on everything they do, often in
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.040]   silence, and utilize the lessons learned in the 1500 plus years of their
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.680]   existence." And so she elaborates, "Is the need for deep work so old, and can we
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.360]   learn from these traditions in a way that is useful to us in the outside
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:53.900]   world?" I think we can, EA. This is an idea that I have been developing recently. When
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.040]   there are work-related fantasies or stories, specific stories of, "Yeah, here's
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.880]   a monk in the Benedictine order in a monastery," or "Here's this person I knew
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.240]   who moved to Maine and they built this cabin by a lake and they just write all
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.040]   day," or whatever it is. When we come across these concrete instantiations of
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.200]   a working life that really resonates with us, these escape fantasies, what do
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.320]   we do with that? And the theory that I'm working on right now is that
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.360]   they're not meant to be taken literally, right? In the sense that
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.160]   this is not a roadmap that you are now considering, "Should I follow this path
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.360]   or not? Oh, maybe I should become a monk. Maybe I should move to a cabin in Maine."
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.160]   In fact, I opened my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, with the story of
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.520]   someone who actually did that. It was the story of someone who had become so
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.280]   attached to the fantasy of becoming a monk that he actually went to this
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.600]   monastic center where he got accepted in it, you live the simple life,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.360]   you...I think it was a Buddhist center, and you meditate and you have these
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.040]   sort of simple jobs, and through the repetition you gain insight. I mean, he had built
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.400]   this up in his head so long, these images of these monks had resonated so
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.480]   much that it just became in his mind, "This must be the path to having meaning
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.720]   in life." So you can imagine how the story unfolded in that opening chapter, So Good
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.600]   He Went, he joined, and within a few weeks he broke down because he realized this
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.560]   wasn't a magic transformation, and that there was still stuff that was annoying,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.840]   and he still had the same anxieties, and it had failed to transform his life, right?
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.740]   So the things that resonate aren't necessarily meant to be roadmaps. So what
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.960]   should we do with them? Well, I think we should take a mythological approach to
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.000]   understanding these professional work fantasies that resonate so much. And by
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.720]   mythological, I mean in a Jungian framework, right? We should actually come
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.680]   at this and try to understand what are the archetypical elements of this story
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.120]   that are creating that resonance. We isolate those from the actual details of
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.200]   the story. So when we look at the monks, what is it about this order that I just
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.840]   get that information that there's something right or appealing or
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.560]   aspirational about what they're doing? You strip away the fact that they're a
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.360]   Benedictine order, and it's a Christian order, and they go to these type of
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.480]   buildings, and they pray every morning, and you extract from it what is the
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   underlying element here that's really catching my attention. In this case, maybe
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.920]   it's the slowness, the not having a really big load of things that you have
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.440]   to do, that your life is simpler, and you can move from one thing to another,
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.400]   and there's presence. You pull out the non-work content-specific underlying
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.360]   archetypical elements, and you isolate them, and you clarify them, and you
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.720]   realize these deep elements, which could apply to any different type of field, it
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.120]   can apply to many different types of jobs, this is what really resonates to me.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.680]   All right, so once you pulled out these are the deeper elements that resonate
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   with me, now you can actually start to do some blueprinting. Now you can start to
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.960]   say, "Okay, given my context, my circumstances, what opportunities are
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.040]   available to me? What are my constraints? What are my abilities? What is the
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.600]   landscape surrounding me of where I could feasibly get in my career?" And
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.360]   start using these isolated elements as the lodestone that guides you. All right,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.760]   if slowness, having less to do, moving from one thing to another, presence with
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.360]   each type, if this is what's really important to me, and yet I am a, you know,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160]   I work for a think tank in Washington DC or something, you look around, okay, given
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.600]   my career capital, given my skills, given the different possibilities here, how
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   could I craft a career that gets that thing in it? And the career you craft
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.120]   might have nothing to do with being a monk, but everything to do with what it
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.680]   was about the monks that appealed to you. And maybe as that think tank director in
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.200]   DC, you end up shifting to, "Let me use the the capital I had developed there to
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.360]   do a consultant-based work," and I'm really just thinking off the top of my head here,
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.920]   "but consultant-based work where I help put together white papers, and I do it
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.760]   six months out of the year, and I could do it remote. I'm gonna move to this
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.560]   different location where life is a little bit slower. I'm going to move
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.160]   out of DC, and I'm moving to wherever, Chestertown, on the eastern shore or
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.400]   something like that, and I'm gonna have a slower life out there, and I'm gonna buy
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.280]   some property that's cheaper out there, I'm gonna have a huge garden that I'm gonna
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.640]   work on, and really the work I do, I do it during six months a year, and it's, I
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.400]   do it in my gazebo, I do it during the warmer months, and I do it in the morning,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.360]   and you could kind of craft the whole life that has that element that you care
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.240]   about. The content of this life may have nothing to do with the content of the
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.360]   story that first told you about this element." So I'm a big believer in this
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.080]   now, a mythological interpretation of career fantasies. Extract the underlying
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.280]   archetypical elements that are driving your aspiration, purify them, isolate them
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   from the specifics of that job, and then look at your landscape and say, "What could
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.720]   I feasibly do that is going to give me more of this thing that's really
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.840]   resonating with me?" And I think people have a lot of options. In other words, you
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.320]   can get a lot of guidance from these concrete stories, just like you can get a
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.280]   lot of guidance from the great myths of the past, without actually having to take
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.560]   them literally, without having to say, "I guess I have to go into Grendel's Den to
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.600]   find, you know, meaning in my life. I guess I have to kill a literal dragon and save
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.000]   the Virgin Princess in order to find drive in my life." Right? We don't actually
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.680]   have to take the myths literally to extract a lot of high-impact value into
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.680]   our life. Let's treat these career stories that resonate the same way. At
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.080]   least that's the idea that I'm working on recently.
