[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   In the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping committed China to the path of development, its strongest
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   asset was its population.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.240]   China was young and smart.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.920]   Reaching 1 billion residents in 1982, the median person was in their low to mid-20s,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.520]   making the country a perfect industrial workforce for a financializing West ready to offshore.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.160]   Four decades of applying it has made China rich, but the accompanying urbanization and
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.680]   population control policies have had a cost too.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.720]   The median Chinese person is now 38 years old and projected to only grow older, nearly
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.120]   50 years old by the mid-century.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.960]   The new China is becoming old.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.600]   This spells trouble for the future because as far as global power and prestige go, being
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.680]   young is at least as important as being rich.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.900]   It's also a problem faced by the entirety of the developed world, not just China.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.200]   In the West, migration is the substitute for failing to raise native birth rates.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.520]   Other regions remain young for now.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.840]   Much of Africa maintains a median age of 20 years.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.960]   Southeast Asia hovers between the late 20s and early 30s, and South America is at 32.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.920]   Each beats the US's median age of 38.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.560]   But if birth rates plunge globally, migration is a partial solution that can only last so
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360]   long and one that would have to be competed for.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.480]   The battle for wealth and the battle for youth represent two axes of power.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.840]   As far as the next few decades go, it's already getting clear who's going to win.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.400]   The Axes
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.440]   Using the two axes of wealth and youth, a simple model of the next few generations divides
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.520]   the globe into four emerging types of state economies.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.080]   The rich and relatively young world of the metropole.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.440]   The rich but geriatric old world.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.320]   The older, economically stagnant, quiet world.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.400]   And the relatively poor but currently high fertility young world.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.280]   We can intuit a number of their characteristics.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.680]   With a relatively young and growing population and a high labor supply, the states of the
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.160]   metropole, primarily the United States, have what it takes to be a global economic power
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.800]   and a locus for immigration.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.280]   But high gross productivity doesn't guarantee a particular per capita income and standard
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.600]   of living for its members.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.240]   It only has to be relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the world to have economic
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.880]   power, and moving there only has to make you relatively richer than home to be a migration
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.240]   hook.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.480]   While the United States is poised to take the lion's share of this migration, other
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.380]   cities located in states with unfavorable fertility, like London or Moscow, will be
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.640]   regional migration hubs as well.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.800]   The so-called "first world" stretches both west and east of America, encompassing
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.480]   both Japan and Western Europe.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.120]   But while they have similar levels of development, this old world has very different migration
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.580]   and fertility patterns from the US.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.120]   Migration is lower, especially in Japan.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.920]   In countries with high migration, like Germany and France, assimilation does not happen as
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.720]   easily as it does in America, and the native populations of these countries seem to have
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.520]   lower fertility than the national average.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.280]   All these countries are highly developed, and they experienced baby booms in the last
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   century.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.120]   They tend to have highly developed social welfare states and are dominant in global
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   institutions.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.680]   Collectively, these regions make up an old world which, in the near term, appears destined
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.200]   for a future of population aging, labor shortage, and slow or zero growth.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.600]   In parts that don't resort to immigration, governments are already attempting to manage
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.520]   this via technology and mechanization.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.120]   It remains to be seen whether any will succeed at increasing their fertility, but countries
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.440]   with cultures of social cooperation and a strong sense of identity, such as Japan, will
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.200]   be interesting to watch.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.100]   The "quiet world" refers to the current "emerging market" states, many of which
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.920]   are on track to become older in median age than the US itself by 2050.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.660]   Rather than "emerging," low future total fertility rates (TFRs) will likely doom places
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.120]   like Turkey, Ukraine, the Balkans, and parts of Central Asia to the "quiet world,"
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.860]   in which an aging population cripples further economic development.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.960]   These countries differ strongly from each other in history and culture.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.520]   Some had developed industrial national economies, others less so, but the fate of Europe's
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.320]   post-Soviet regions loom particularly large.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.000]   While some have gotten richer in the past 30 years, emigration rates are extremely high
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.400]   among the young, and it is unlikely that most of these countries can complete a strong development
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.360]   track of the sort China accomplished.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.440]   Finally, we see the rise of a massive new category, the "young world," an untapped
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   labor workforce of billions, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Southeast
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.600]   Asia, and South and Central America.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.960]   Much of the offshoring over the last four decades did not reach these regions, although
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.480]   Chinese offshoring now is.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.680]   While much of the young world now lives in urban, semi-industrialized societies, hundreds
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.120]   of millions still live in rural regions.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.360]   This population will be progressively incorporated into the world system of the metropole, as
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.120]   its current population ages out of their roles.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.300]   The integration of these regions into production networks will be a major challenge given the
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.520]   extensive cultural differences, lower human capital, and lack of history with economic
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.280]   mobilization.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.200]   Social socialization takes a long time, sometimes generations, to complete.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.800]   The Metropole Assuming current trends, the US of 2050 will
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.040]   have a median age of 41.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.440]   It will be decisively younger than China and other East Asian states, and will edge out
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.380]   Iran, Turkey, Russia, Mexico, and even Brazil.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.240]   The so-called "bricks" countries built a coalition on marketing themselves as part
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.120]   of a young, rising world.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.000]   In the battle of youth, the US will beat all except South Africa.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.280]   Even more importantly, the US will have large and growing numbers of young workers, many
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.040]   more than other states of roughly similar median age.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.360]   This will give the country a demographic edge over the so-called "emerging markets"
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.120]   of today, and its economic heft will only grow as its population does.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.720]   From the current figure of 332 million, the US population is expected to reach 400 million
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.880]   in 2058, at currently projected rates.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.840]   The Census Bureau predicts continued growth throughout the entire 21st century, with the
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:33.600]   population projected to reach an immense 571 million by 2100.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.240]   The number of people reaching military age annually isn't just a useful statistical
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.480]   measure of both military manpower, it's also an indicator of annual workforce growth.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.920]   In order, the top 10 countries ranked by this metric are currently India, China, Indonesia,
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:59.400]   Pakistan, the US, Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and the DRC.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.760]   In a practical sense, these are the largest 10 countries on earth.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   In the future, the US is the only already rich country that still appears in the global
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   top group on this sort of manpower comparison.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.360]   The increase in both total population and young people will be heavily driven by international
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.200]   immigration.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.960]   After 2030, net immigration is expected to overtake the natural increase of residents
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.000]   as the prime driver of population growth.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.320]   By 2060, net immigration is expected to be double the annual natural increase, adding
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.640]   over 1 million people per year.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.760]   Population is unquestionably the key factor in suppressing the process of population aging
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.960]   and workforce decline.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:54.080]   According to the US Census, "In 2016, about 78% of the foreign-born population was of
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:02.680]   working age, between 18 and 64 years, compared with just 59% of the native-born."
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.160]   This will expand the size and relative power of some demographics, such as Hispanics in
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   the US.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.200]   It's likely that the current major cities will retain their place and prestige.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.120]   Given that cities will attract the bulk of this migration, the battles between residents
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.920]   and newcomers will almost certainly magnify.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   Both the adversarial use of zoning, which can already be seen in current development
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.320]   battles, and more violent conflicts between classes and ethnic groups will likely occur.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.160]   It's also likely that current upper-middle class remnants within a number of cities will
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.880]   finally get pushed out or reduced to the professional renter class.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.360]   However, some cities may figure out the right mix of building and law enforcement that stabilizes
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.200]   them into high-growth cities with minimal or ghettoized social conflict.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.240]   In these cities, each year's cohort of young workers will be larger than the last.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.920]   The total number of persons under 18 in the United States is projected to continually
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:13.360]   increase, going from approximately 74.0 million today to 80.1 million in 2060.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.040]   Many will be absorbed not only into the professional classes.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.600]   One of the traits of the metropole is that it is generally good for individual people
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.480]   as economic actors, but generally bad for population groups in terms of fertility and
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.960]   cultural continuity.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.200]   Migrants from the young world will improve their own individual situations, but, like
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.880]   previous generations of migrants, will likely see fertility decline when faced with the
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.520]   social and economic pressures of the metropole cities.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.320]   Overall, this inflow will benefit the employers of large industries like agriculture that
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.040]   can handle high turnover, as well as those with the resources to continually retrain
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.360]   new entrants into not just their company, but broader US professional norms.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.920]   In practice, it's likely that as cultural commonality declines, coordination within
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.360]   companies will become increasingly difficult to do well without an extremely strong set
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.920]   of internal norms and rigorous enforcement.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.280]   Particularly hard to resolve will be ethnic conflict along lines that are hard for US
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:26.720]   culture to perceive and regulate, such as the caste discrimination that already occurs
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.160]   in Silicon Valley.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.600]   Despite the inevitable conflicts that will play out at the middle and lower levels of
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.440]   metropole society, there are clear beneficiaries in its power structure.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.960]   The US economy is already set up to favor large globalized companies with offshore production
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.980]   and onshore logistics and management, and US political elites share close ties with
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.600]   these industries.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.140]   It's the outcomes of current political battles, not economic ones like wealthy tech billionaires
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.600]   versus DC regulators or competing energy lobbies, that will determine who wins access to the
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.280]   resources of the metropole.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.800]   The process of creating a metropole via demographic replacement will create strong growth of total
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.120]   GDP, with the related effects of strong asset appreciation and, particularly, the consistent
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.560]   growth of real estate values.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   This will benefit pre-existing holders of power and wealth above all else.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.640]   In contrast to the US, members of the old world will generally have continually shrinking
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.200]   workforces, with each year's cohort of workers being smaller than the one before.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.380]   This differentiation is more radical than would be suggested merely by median age figures.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.680]   Even with the much-publicized immigration and refugee influx into Germany, the German
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.360]   workforce is currently shrinking at the rate of 300,000 people per year due to retirements,
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:59.720]   and the annual labor shortfall is expected to reach a staggering 650,000 by 2029.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.520]   Statistics like this clearly show that the US is no longer even in the same category
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.120]   of country as many of its purported first world peers.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.680]   The process of transition to a metropole is frequently characterized as a national collapse
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.120]   by commentators who erroneously conflate the global power of a state with the disruption
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.440]   of individual living standards for the lower and middle classes.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.320]   Indeed, it would appear that the decline of human development indicators may be an integral
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.940]   part of the metropole's power.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:37.160]   While this process increases gross GDP and national power, large swathes of the metropole
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:44.480]   population could, and likely will, see falling life expectancy, increased child poverty,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.720]   rising crime rates, and unaffordable housing.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.600]   The metropole begins as a first world country, with all the wealth and infrastructure that
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   implies.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.480]   However, these first world conditions appear to inevitably lead to very high labor costs
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.440]   and a shrinking workforce due to low fertility, population aging, and welfare programs reducing
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.680]   the imperative to work.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.720]   The logic of the metropole is that it dramatically short-circuits this process by implanting
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.360]   something resembling a lower-cost, emerging market workforce directly into the existing
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.080]   structure of a formerly first world country.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.360]   To a large extent, the entire economic point of this process is to maximize gross GDP and
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.600]   world power by reducing wage growth, which is done by compelling the native population
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.000]   to compete with a hungry workforce of first and second generation immigrants.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.040]   An optimistic view sees this as a viable, large, moderate-cost workforce, integrated
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.800]   into the pre-existing expertise, population, and resources of a first world country.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.200]   This will allow a mix of resource exporting, a degree of high-value technical exports,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.400]   and huge amount of white-collar work in finance, logistics, software, and similar industries.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.760]   The massive agricultural capacity of places like the Mississippi Basin will continue to
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.200]   provide huge volumes of grain for export.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.600]   A more pessimistic view would suggest that the level of disruption and population replacement
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:20.720]   involved in this process will more fundamentally erase the inherited advantages of the existing
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:27.480]   first world nation, leading to serious instability or deterioration of technical capacity.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.400]   But even in relatively more pessimistic projections, it is hard to picture how a state with a population
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:40.520]   of 500-700 million and potentially the world's largest GDP would fail to be one of the world's
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.560]   preeminent geopolitical powers.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.220]   The US capacity for energy independence is a particular advantage for its role as a metropole.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:55.240]   The considerable domestic production and reserves of oil, gas, and especially coal will fuel
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.960]   US industry and agriculture.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.160]   If current trends hold, there will not be any other large, young, and wealthy power
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.520]   on earth in this century other than the United States.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.760]   The Old World By the mid-century, the cumulative effects
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.120]   of aging and low fertility on currently wealthy countries in Europe and East Asia will become
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.180]   apparent.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.640]   The old world countries are those whose populations age and shrink due to low immigration and
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.800]   fertility.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.240]   Their populations are on track to plunge below the levels of the period in which these countries
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.440]   became rich to begin with.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.560]   In the decades ahead, they will face an entirely different social and economic trajectory than
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.920]   the United States.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:48.080]   Japan's current population of 128 million is projected to drop to 86.7 million by 2060,
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:54.560]   and its already advanced median age is predicted to increase to 53 by 2050.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.480]   Germany's population of 83.2 million will fall to 74 million by 2060, with the median
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.040]   age increasing from 44 to 51.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:11.880]   Italy's population of 60.7 million is expected to drop to 58.6 million by 2050, and 53.7
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.400]   million by 2065.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.920]   Its median age will increase from 43 to 50 by the year 2050.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:26.160]   South Korea will fall from 51 million to 44 million in 2060, with a stunning increase
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.520]   in median age from 38 to 53 by 2050.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:39.080]   By way of contrast, the US median age will rise to only 41 by 2050, with France and the
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.960]   UK both at 42, and all three will have population growth rather than shrinkage.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.480]   However, outside of their capital cities, France and the UK lack the natural resources
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.920]   and overall populations to match the power of the US itself, making them something like
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.540]   bridge countries between the metropole and the old world proper.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:06.200]   Countries with median ages in the 50s are entirely unprecedented, and no one really
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.340]   knows how a country in this situation will continue functioning.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.320]   In the most affected countries, more than 35% of the total population could be over
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.840]   65 by 2050.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.480]   Obvious effects include a drastic fall in geopolitical importance, stagnant or declining
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.760]   asset and real estate valuations, shortages and high prices of all forms of labor, and
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.040]   permanently falling or stagnant GDP.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.320]   Due to current high levels of wealth, health, education, and infrastructure, these countries
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.720]   will probably maintain statistically higher levels of individual human development and
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.160]   well-being for the foreseeable future, in a manner decoupled from their collapse in
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   global importance.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.320]   Life in these places might be quite pleasant for the younger people due to a profound lack
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.200]   of competition for housing stock and the ability to demand extremely high wages for non-mechanized
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.240]   human labor jobs.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.680]   As far as its role in the world system led by the metropole, the most obvious role of
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:11.240]   the old world may be recreational and aesthetic, particularly as a playground for the more
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.840]   privileged classes of the metropole and the young world.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.400]   The beauty and natural value of these lands in the eyes of outsiders will only be enhanced
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.080]   by the general slowing of activity and industry.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.840]   Also, much of this area has great agricultural potential as well as an increasingly vacant
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.160]   countryside, raising the potential of expanded export agriculture using some form of guest
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.920]   worker labor from the young world.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.600]   Further potential lies in the deep linguistic and cultural links that some of the old world
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.360]   nations retain with their former colonial possessions in the young world.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.760]   A number of these old world countries still provide managerial, financial, and more advanced
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.120]   manufacturing services to their former colonial possessions, acting as a sort of back office
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.600]   for the young world.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.880]   However, there is a danger that life in the old world will create a profound psychological
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.960]   malaise that only accelerates the process of degrowth and population collapse.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.600]   What does it do to the human mind when you live in comfort, but there is no apparent
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:18.380]   future and nothing for your civilization to do but curate the relics of the past?
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.840]   Life in many parts of the old world will mean not hearing the voices of children in the
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.680]   now empty park outside your window.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.200]   Most of the teens and young adults you will see on a daily basis will be tourists, immigrants,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.380]   or foreign guest workers.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.160]   It may be that talented young workers from the old world emigrate to the metropole, or
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.960]   even the young world due to emotional rather than economic factors, out of the sheer desire
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.240]   to be where things are happening.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.520]   Given the high living standards for young people who do grow up in the old world, it
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.360]   might seem like there should be higher migration to it from the metropole.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.520]   For those tired of a highly competitive life in the cities, a quiet existence in an aging
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.800]   welfare state might even sound idyllic.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.320]   But while such migration happens even now, there are many barriers to American migration
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.380]   to Europe or East Asia.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.600]   The sheer logistics of formal immigration in these countries can be difficult, and most
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.160]   Americans face both cultural and linguistic barriers.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.360]   For countries like Japan, permanent residency is extremely difficult to achieve, and most
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.560]   foreigners will never become citizens.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.600]   The fact is that the majority of people in any country, even those of the young world,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.400]   will never even attempt to emigrate.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.800]   Those who do will be a relatively small and privileged class with the ability to overcome
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.280]   these barriers.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.760]   The ties of language and culture are strong, and the metropole has ample opportunity within
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.280]   its borders for the ambitious.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.400]   The longer game for these places is, in a sense, mysterious.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.440]   Current trends are inexorably leading towards total fertility rates below one child per
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.500]   couple.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:04.280]   Each new generation, pre-migration, is now approaching half the size of the prior, and
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.120]   the degree of shrinkage and aging discussed in this article appears inevitable, since
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.840]   even a deep cultural change to combat the momentum of this process would take decades.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.160]   One could speculate that these nations might eventually evolve a new cultural form or new
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.800]   subpopulations that have the ability to maintain above-replacement birth rates while living
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.020]   a fully technological developed existence, but there is little evidence of this to date.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.080]   One might also predict mass incursions amounting to an invasion of these weak and dormant lands
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.580]   from the young world.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.560]   These nations still have the power to repel mass migration, but they may not choose to
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.960]   do so.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.880]   The Quiet World
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.840]   In contrast with the old but rich world, there is the quiet world, and the related concept
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.060]   of the BRICS countries.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.020]   These states are generally on a track to become old before ever approaching first world levels
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.960]   of wealth and development.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.680]   Rather than first world equivalents, this quiet world seems fated to spend the middle
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:09.240]   and later 21st century as lower middle income countries with the average person being middle
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.480]   aged.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.640]   In comparison, by 2050 the United States will socially be closer to our image of an emerging
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   market than the formerly emerging countries of this quiet world will be.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.160]   The demographic situations in China and Russia are well known, but it is very interesting
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.720]   to examine some of the smaller emerging markets, which most people casually assume to be fast
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.200]   growing, youthful places.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:39.480]   By 2050, Brazil will have a median age of 44, similar to modern day Italy.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.400]   Turkey will have a median age of 42 by 2050, similar to Spain today.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.720]   Iran and Mexico will also have a median age of 42 by then.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:54.040]   All either match or even exceed the US in age by this point in time.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.880]   Developers of South and Southeast Asia may even join this category near the end of the
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.000]   century.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.800]   Both Indonesia and India will have a median age of approximately 37 by 2050, similar to
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.240]   the modern United States.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.480]   However, even India is projected to begin experiencing significant population loss and
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.620]   unfavorable ratios of pensioners to workers after 2050.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.880]   The tenor of life in this coming "quiet world" is hard to predict.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:28.200]   What might life be like in a Turkey or Mexico that has the sleepy, elderly-heavy demographics
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.100]   of present-day Spain or Italy but without the high incomes?
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.280]   The most obvious example of fairly old and poor countries existing today are some of
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.360]   the post-Soviet areas, such as Ukraine with a median age of 41.2 and pre-war per capita
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.080]   GDP of 3,726 US dollars.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.280]   The economic impasse of poor countries too old to generate growth will become a major
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.080]   global issue far beyond the old Eastern bloc.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.760]   On the other hand, many of these countries are major exporters of petroleum and food
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.480]   grains, and it is possible that increasing values for such commodities combined with
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.840]   stable populations might allow for reasonably comfortable conditions for these aging populations.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.840]   The speed of manufacturing transition towards the young world may also become an asset for
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.320]   those able to integrate into the new supply chains.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:24.160]   Given their current economies, Mexico and Turkey have the capacity to maintain but not
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.200]   to increase their manufacturing and assembly operations, particularly in complex fields
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.860]   such as automotive, shipbuilding, aviation, and armaments.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:39.280]   But no major emerging market country has the capacity to actually emerge as a leading world
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.880]   power or seriously challenge the United States in the post-2030 period.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.080]   With the exception of India and its delayed trajectory, their maximum geopolitical power
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.160]   and influence have probably already peaked.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.720]   The Young World As the First World plunges towards median
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:04.000]   ages in the 50s, most of Africa still has median ages under 20, with Niger the lowest
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.100]   at only 14.8 years.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.840]   Outside of Africa, there is still a significant young world as well, including Palestine at
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:21.520]   18, Afghanistan at 19.5, Yemen at 19.8, Iraq at 21.2, Pakistan at 22, Guatemala at 23,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:29.360]   Jordan at 23.5, Syria at 23.5, Egypt at 24, and Honduras at 24.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.160]   Much of this young world will retain median ages of under 30 years old to 2050 or beyond,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.120]   similar to Mexico today, while traditional cheap labor countries such as Thailand and
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:45.200]   China age into their 50s and presumably become non-viable for high labor production.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:51.120]   The new cities of this young world will be vast, turbulent, and often violent, as has
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.520]   always been the lot of young and fast-growing cities.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:02.480]   In 2050, the DRC's Kinshasa will have 35 million, Lagos will have 32 million, and Karachi
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.400]   will have 31 million inhabitants.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:11.080]   The raw demographics that compel this outcome are essentially already in place.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:16.360]   Barring some unprecedented global collapse, the young parents of Lagos in 2040 are already
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.240]   alive now.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.600]   The future of this young world will likely be characterized by a rolling frontier of
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:28.020]   manufacturing and other high-labor enterprises, quite possibly including large agricultural
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.580]   and natural resource projects.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.080]   This is an attractive option for current rich countries, but it also requires a workforce
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.480]   willing to venture into the young world and oppose the physical and logistical discipline
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.980]   of industrial economies in these regions, a process China is carrying out across many
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.960]   regions today.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.180]   Creating an industrial workforce is immensely difficult.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.680]   It required a full mobilization of society in Europe and America, from mass public schooling
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.400]   and factory discipline to negotiating institutions between employers and workers.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.680]   The process will likely look similar to what occurred in Mexico, where a very poor, almost
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.160]   entirely agrarian nation gradually developed into a hub of industry and commercial agriculture,
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.520]   which now supplies much of America's vegetables and assembles our highly complex computerized
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.320]   cars and trucks.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.320]   Both US and Mexican companies carried out the process with state backing.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.200]   Airports in the least developed African states provide another example of maintaining advanced
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.840]   infrastructure in areas without human or physical support systems.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:35.520]   You can fly from Omaha, Nebraska to Jemena, Chad within a day and a half on commercial
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.880]   passenger jets with no extraordinary difficulty.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.240]   But the radar, control systems, jets, and everything else involved in operating a commercial
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.560]   airport in Chad are imported wholesale.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.040]   The airport is de facto under the control of French Air Force officers, although the
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.160]   personnel you encounter when arriving are trained native Chadians.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.840]   The frontier is rolling because the metropole and the old world do not necessarily outsource
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.600]   to the least developed, youngest, and lowest labor cost locations.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.280]   There is very little export manufacturing in the least developed and theoretically cheapest
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.720]   countries of sub-Saharan Africa due to their critical lack of infrastructure and human
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.080]   capital, not to mention populations that may be entirely unaccustomed to routine wage labor
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.920]   or mechanical processes.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.920]   However, the goal is to strike an ideal balance between low labor costs and minimally adequate
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.680]   infrastructure and workforce development.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.220]   The development of this vast new economic frontier will likely move roughly in order
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.900]   of higher to lower median age and higher to lower development.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:43.560]   This is because the very youngest countries, without exception, are either extremely underdeveloped,
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:50.000]   engaged in civil war, and disorder of a type that precludes foreign investment, or both.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.040]   Historically, as in China and India, foreign investment for export appears to gravitate
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.280]   towards countries of the median age in the early 20s versus the mid-teens seen in much
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.280]   of Africa.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.720]   A key example of a country that was too young is Ethiopia.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.680]   Much was made in the financial press of Ethiopia as one of the next big emerging markets, but
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.480]   the country has recently descended into a period of open-ended civil war with up to
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.420]   500,000 total deaths to date.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:23.760]   This is not so surprising if we consider that Ethiopia's current median age is 19.5.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.000]   This age increased from 16 due to the early stages of modernization, but Ethiopia blew
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.080]   up right as it approached age 20.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.920]   As costs continue to rise in India or Thailand, attention in Asia will likely shift to Pakistan
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   or Egypt.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.240]   At a certain point, conditions will suggest an extension of operations from Pakistan into
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.960]   Afghanistan.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.840]   China is already courting its new government, and from Egypt into Yemen or Iraq.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.040]   From there, the more developed African states, such as Sudan and Nigeria, are a logical choice.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.600]   It may be late in the century before attention seriously turns to the last frontiers of labor,
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:09.000]   such as Mali, Chad, and the DRC, for ventures other than mining and resource projects.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.040]   The New Frontier Like 19th century Europe, the US seems on track
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   for stricter internal competition for space and opportunity.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.840]   California provides a rough preview of domestic conditions as it approaches 2050.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:30.600]   By any objective numbers, California is incredibly rich, nationally dominant, and very far from
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.480]   collapsing.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.680]   It has high asset prices, enormous agricultural production, and a very large population that
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.580]   has grown steadily over the past 50 years.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:45.700]   It has not just the largest economy by far of any US state, but also the fifth largest
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:54.120]   economy in the world at $3.36 trillion, versus Texas at $1.99 trillion and New York at $1.85
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.120]   trillion.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.240]   California attracts large numbers of legal and illegal immigrants from every corner of
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.780]   the earth, many from the young world.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.220]   The increasing amount of residences with ties to the young world and other parts of the
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.780]   globe give it an outward-looking culture.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:14.200]   Yet California is becoming famous for exporting native-born Californians.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.620]   In the midst of its affluence, many natives have fled, finding that extreme asset prices
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.680]   and competition with a constant stream of new immigrant workers render it impossible
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.300]   for them to make the sort of life they desire in their native land.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.880]   California presents a situation of simultaneous immigration and displacement, even as it grows
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.420]   larger and richer.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:40.060]   As much ire as California draws, it doesn't stop drawing people.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:44.600]   Even many who leave end up coming back or maintaining business ties.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.720]   And the metropole has the priors for a similar kind of term-setting power in its relationship
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.340]   to the other spheres of the world.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:57.900]   Rather than multipolarity or decoupling, the hard realities of age and wealth will add
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:17.100]   up to a system of global power that, in many ways, looks very familiar.
