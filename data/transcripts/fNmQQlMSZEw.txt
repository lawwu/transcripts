[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]   We don't talk a lot about hotel status.
[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.160]   It feels like in the points and miles world, it's Hyatt, globalist or forget it.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.480]   A big part of it too, is because airline status is so hard to get with credit
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.140]   cards, while hotel status is given out willy nilly.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.020]   So you have like all these cards that give you either like mid-level or
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.440]   even like higher level status, Hilton, Diamond being one of the prime examples.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.100]   You're getting a top level status by getting a credit card that runs you 450.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.520]   And then I would argue that the card actually is a net positive because
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.340]   of all the credits and the free night.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.920]   So you have all these people that have status because the math makes sense.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.980]   The reason people like Hyatt is because that's the one you actually had to chase
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.520]   and had to do, meaning that there's less people that have it, meaning that.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.720]   It's more beneficial because upgrades actually come to you.
