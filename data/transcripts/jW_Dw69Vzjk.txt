[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   A listener named Lawrence writes in to ask about two seemingly conflicting Bible passages.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.600]   He asks, 1 Corinthians 12, 3 says that no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.000]   Holy Spirit.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.680]   Parallel verses in 1 John 4, verses 2 to 3 say the same.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.560]   However, in Matthew 7, verses 21 to 23, Jesus says that there will be many who will say
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.520]   to him, "Lord, Lord," to whom Jesus will reply, "I never knew you."
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.080]   Pastor John, how are we to understand these two statements as true?
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:43.720]   So the issue here is the tension between two texts, and really, texts and our experience
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   as well.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.800]   And there are more than just these, and I'll probably point out one.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.680]   1 Corinthians 12, 3 says no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Spirit.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680]   Glorious text.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.880]   We can't, we are so dead and so resistant to the Lordship of Jesus, we can't say Jesus
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.320]   is Lord except the Holy Spirit worked that in us.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.400]   But Lawrence points out, Matthew 7, 21, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.400]   enter the kingdom of heaven but the one who does the will of my Father."
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.840]   So there's a tension.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.480]   It sounds like, whoa, they called him Lord and it wasn't by the Spirit because they're
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.180]   going to perish.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.280]   They're not even doing the will of God, so how do the two texts fit together?
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.960]   Let me add one more tension before I try to solve it.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.160]   Romans 8, 15 says this, "You did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.120]   but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father,' the
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.520]   Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God."
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.260]   So it sounds like, oh, if a person says, "Abba, Father," then they have the spirit of adoption
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.360]   and they're Christians.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.100]   But Jesus criticized certain Jewish leaders because they did call God their Father and
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.340]   he said, "You don't even know God as your Father."
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.940]   And today we know that people can call God Father and not be saved.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.580]   In fact, the old liberal approach 100 years ago was to prefer to call God Father and they
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.940]   didn't have a substitutionary atonement at all in their theology.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.300]   They just loved the fatherhood of God.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.840]   So it's possible to call God Lord, it's possible to call God Father, and not have it be any
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.360]   evidence of true faith at all.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.820]   So what do we make of that?
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:45.100]   I think there are two pointers in these texts that help us understand how both Paul in 1
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.060]   Corinthians 12 and in Romans 8 want to be, mean to be, understood.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.080]   So that if you call Jesus Lord and you call God your Father, you are truly under the influence
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.200]   of the saving work of the Spirit.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   So what would that be?
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.720]   What are these pointers?
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.380]   In verse 15 of Romans 8, he says, "You have received the spirit of adoption of sons by
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.880]   whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.120]   And I wonder, I think, that Paul's choice of the word "cry" is to communicate to us,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.080]   "I mean this is sincerely coming from your heart."
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.720]   This is not something that's just slipping off your tongue to cloak that there's no cry
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.040]   in your heart to God as your Father.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.680]   You really mean this.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.860]   This goes down deep into your heart.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.680]   The cry that rises up and overflows is a real childlike reliance upon a wonderful Father
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.120]   whom you trust.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.860]   I think that's what he means when he says that by the Holy Spirit we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.840]   Not just by the Holy Spirit, we can say the words, "Abba, Father."
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.000]   A computer can say the words, "Abba, Father."
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   Here's the second pointer.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.060]   Same thing, really, in 1 Corinthians 12, 3.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.100]   Because there it says nobody can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Spirit.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.740]   And the phrase is "Kurios, Iesous."
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.940]   Kurios is Lord, Iesous is Jesus.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:29.980]   And my guess is that in the context of Corinth at that time, this phrase, as opposed to "Kurios
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.700]   Kaisaros," Caesar is Lord, would have carried such radical danger.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.420]   In other words, you're light.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.420]   This is treason.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.420]   This is treason.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.340]   You're going to stand up and say in public, "Kurios Iesous," and have every eye turn to
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.900]   you and say, "You're dead.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.900]   This is dangerous."
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.180]   You're going to get your head chopped off for talking like that.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.820]   So my guess is that that phrase carried in itself, in that context, such loaded dangers
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.020]   and risks that only the sincere would say it.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.900]   And so Paul did mean when he said nobody can say it except by the Spirit, he meant nobody
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.240]   can say it and really feel it, mean it, be willing to risk your life because of it.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:28.180]   So I think the answer to both seeming contradictions in Romans and 1 Corinthians is that both of
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:36.800]   them intend for us to mean our confession of Jesus as Lord and our confession of Jesus
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:47.540]   as our precious Father must be real and can only be real and authentic and heartfelt if
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.660]   the Holy Spirit is profoundly at work in our lives.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.260]   So the implication for our lives would be, number one, realize how helpless we are without
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.820]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.660]   We cannot sincerely acknowledge Jesus as Lord and sincerely cry out like a little child
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.300]   to God as our Father if the Holy Spirit's not giving us the power.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:18.100]   And secondly, we should cry out to Him for the Holy Spirit lest we prove to be hypocrites
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.700]   and just playing games in the end.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.620]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.660]   That's a fascinating connection in Corinth, by the way.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.100]   This episode reminds me of episode 346 we recorded back in May, which is titled "Can
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.660]   I Believe the Whole Bible and Not Be Elect?"
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.740]   Be sure to check that out in the archive.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.620]   Tomorrow we talk about the family, specifically family worship.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.540]   It's a practice many Christian families engage in together at home, but what is it?
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.540]   What does it look like?
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.580]   And what are the aims?
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.740]   We welcome back to the podcast parenting expert Ted Tripp to explain.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.140]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.060]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
