[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   When did you realize we had, you know, something special with, uh, Nicola?
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.700]   Did you, did you know that early on?
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.020]   I know Nerkich was here at the time.
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.960]   That was a, it's a, it's a funny story about, about Nicola.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.880]   Um, and if anybody tells you they knew they are lying through their teeth.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.920]   I didn't know.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.560]   The first year I got drafted, I went to training camp and I had no idea.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.000]   Like just cause you know, he treats a game different than practice.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.960]   So I'm seeing Mason Plumlee and Nicola go at it.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.400]   I'm like, wait, why does Nicola start over Mason?
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.080]   Like, I remember that was my thought process.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.760]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.520]   Tell me that story.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.960]   How did you?
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.600]   So yeah, Yoke, Yoke is a, is a funny story.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   Um, I remember sitting with, um, our former president of basketball ops and GM
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160]   at the time, uh, Tim Connolly and Arturis Karnaschovas that one of them now runs
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.760]   the Timberwolves.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.400]   One of them now runs the Chicago Bulls.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.840]   Um, but they were in our front office at the time.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.520]   They're like, Hey, there's this guy that you should, you should see on tape.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.640]   Cause we want to, we want him to keep his name in the draft and he, but he
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.400]   wants to stay over in Europe for one more year.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.240]   And, you know, we're going, we're in a phase at the time where we wanted as many
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.800]   young players as we could get and to try to see what we could grow.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.920]   And, um, so I was actually like, why, why does he want to stay over in Europe one
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.400]   more year?
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.800]   And both Tim and Arturis were like, it's just, it's best for his development.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.720]   And we think that there's a skill level there that, that could be interesting.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.360]   Um, but I remember them showing me on tape and Nicola's wearing like this, their
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.080]   colors were like pink and blue and, and Nicola couldn't jump over a phone book,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.720]   but he'd catch these balls and he'd throw these passes that you were like, I don't
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.000]   know how that's going to translate, but that player's basketball IQ is obviously
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.600]   off the charts.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.360]   And, um, and so we, we drafted him, he stayed over for one more year and then he
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.280]   came over in the summer of 2015.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.640]   And my dad actually has really good stories about, um, being down in a weight
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.040]   room, you know, early in the morning that summer and Nicola would be in there every
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   morning with his two brothers and they'd be beaten on him, like kind of before the
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.880]   coaches would even come in and he'd be in there.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.440]   But over time, I think Nicola cleaned up, he cleaned up his diet.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.960]   Um, he understood what it took to be a professional.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.680]   And, you know, you referenced Yusef Nurkic, who was another, another really
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.800]   good young player that we had on our roster at the time.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.360]   And, uh, we couldn't quite tell what, what to do with both of them because Yusef, I
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.760]   think, had made second team All-Rookie, um, and Nicola was coming over.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.320]   And so we had a very established center and, but we knew that they both had really
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   good hands, really good skills.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.880]   And, uh, the, the, the thing that was unfortunate is the league was trending.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   That was when the Warriors were on their ascension and, uh, the league was trending
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.960]   to this small ball, you know, shooting everywhere and even more extreme than it
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.200]   is now, almost.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.320]   It was like, everyone's wanted to try to be the Warriors like almost overnight.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.480]   And you couldn't play Nicola and, and, and Yusef together.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.080]   You had two seven footers that were incredibly skilled and very unselfish
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.320]   guys, but trying to play them together, while it did present its advantages at
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.840]   certain points, it was, it was tough.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.200]   It was a tough for them to cover whenever you got, you know, kind of almost four
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   guards out there moving around and sink.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.760]   And it's a tough defensive cover.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.920]   Um, so we had to really kind of put our heads together on what we wanted to do.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.000]   And fortunately by the time, um, after, after Nicola's first, first season, I
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.440]   think he made first team all rookie.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.760]   Um, and then we were halfway into the second year and, uh, we were really
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.280]   realizing that we couldn't, we had to pick, we had to choose because they're
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.040]   both starting level centers.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.720]   And, and I think Yusef's contract was coming up in about a year.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.560]   And so we were having our analytics group run all the different numbers of how to
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   compare the two and what to look for.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.480]   And all of a sudden this, this comparison comes through.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.040]   And fortunately we had enough data at the time to be able to really put together
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   per 36 minutes and compare different things.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.800]   And so, uh, this comparison comes through and it's player A and player B and it
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.120]   was, uh, they're in their second season.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.080]   And the only, the only difference of the two is that player A is two years older
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.760]   than player B at the time of their second year in the NBA.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.680]   Player A just entered the league later and you could clearly see that player B's
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.240]   numbers were better in really every category.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.000]   Um, and so I was like, okay, I was like, I'm going to guess that player B is
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.800]   Nicola and they're like, yep, you're right.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.680]   Player B is Nicola.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.880]   And I'm like, all right, well, then who are we talking about with player where is
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.320]   this, there's some sort of comparison with Nurk or is there some sort of comparison
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.200]   with someone else in the league?
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.080]   And they're like, player A is Larry Bird.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.600]   And I was like, oh, like you looked at the per 36 and so they, that, that was when I
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.800]   think all of us kind of looked at each other, like, because you know, sometimes
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.320]   with, when you, when you talk to like a basketball purist, even when you, to your
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.280]   point, Nicola's, his skillset and the way that he plays, you know, the eye test, he
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.920]   doesn't jump out at you right away, but when you watch it over time and you
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.800]   understand what he's doing and how he's affecting a game, it really jumps out at
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.000]   you. And so that was when, and that was in, that was like the first week of
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.040]   December and I think we were on like a four or five game skid at the time.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.360]   And then Tim and I wound up on the phone.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.640]   I was like, Tim, I was like, I'm never going to tell anyone who to play, any
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.680]   coach what to do, but if we're going to pick one, tell him to put Nicola in and
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.880]   we, we gotta, we gotta roll with it.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.880]   And, and then that was the famous, you know, the next night or the night after
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.960]   was, uh, the date was that December or something when that was when Yoke went
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.680]   into the starting lineup and never, never came out, never came out.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680]   It was in Dallas, I think.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   I have unlimited Nicola stories too, about the cleaning up the diet and stuff.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.920]   My first couple of years, I mean, he cared about basketball, but you know, he
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.800]   would go home to Serbia in the summer and come back out of shape.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.640]   I've seen him progress every year, even from MVP year to MVP year, he's somehow
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.240]   progressing.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.320]   So you guys obviously made the right choice, man.
