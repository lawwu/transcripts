[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   I would prefer to have open borders for Iceland.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.880]   If the open borders advocates are right, and open borders will have no, if no
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.400]   noticeable effect on institutional quality, then it's great to move, have
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.820]   our open borders experiment run in a country that's lightly populated, has
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.920]   a lot of open land, and has good institutional quality, and Iceland
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.300]   fits the bill perfectly for that.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.000]   So we could preserve the institutional innovation skill, the institutional
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.140]   quality of the, what I call the I7, that's China, Japan, South Korea,
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.600]   the US, Germany, UK, France, and choose any country out of the hundred, out
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780]   of the couple of dozen countries that have good institutional quality, just
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.580]   pick one of the others that aren't one of those seven, pick one that's not
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.100]   an innovation powerhouse, and turn that into your open borders country.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580]   You could, if you wanted to get basically Singapore levels of
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.320]   population density in Iceland, that'd be about 300 million people, I think.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.880]   I think that's about where the numbers end up looking, something like that.
