[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets, and today I'm
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   very pleased to welcome Brandon, the mad scientist, to the show. Brandon, welcome.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.080]   Brandon Sheets Thank you very much. I'm really excited to
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.640]   be here and I'm really happy to be on this side of the interview for once. It's going
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.440]   to be nice and relaxing rather than trying to be the interviewer and worrying about asking
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.240]   questions.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.040]   Joshua Sheets Exactly. It is definitely more nerve-wracking
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.320]   to be on the interviewer side because you're trying to produce a quality product instead
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.360]   of just simply going with the flow and sharing your story. So hopefully it'll be fun for
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.680]   you.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.480]   Brandon Sheets Absolutely.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840]   Joshua Sheets For those of you who don't know, Brandon does
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.080]   record a podcast, an occasional interview podcast mainly, at least those are the episodes
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.080]   that I've heard, and he writes a blog at madscientist.com. I highly encourage you to go and check out
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.880]   his writing and his show. I've actually, Brandon, I just interviewed Paula from affordanything.com,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.960]   and I first heard her off of your show and went and enjoyed her website because you had
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.280]   found her. So thanks for that connection there.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.920]   Brandon Sheets Oh, that's cool. Yeah, Paula's great. I'm
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.080]   actually hopefully going to be meeting her in October and look forward to talking to
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.960]   her again, but I'll look forward to hearing that podcast because, yeah, I had a great
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.280]   time speaking with her.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.920]   Joshua Sheets Cool. So just a little intro for people.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.120]   Today's show, I'm hoping, Brandon has a number of good articles, and I'm going to walk through
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.280]   some of his articles, and I'm hoping that today's show winds up being fairly meaty.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.840]   So we'll get to know him a little bit and find out a little bit about his story, but
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.480]   then we're going to walk through some of the strategies that he's using to pursue his financial
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.040]   goals. He's written some excellent articles. All those articles that we're going to reference
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.420]   will be in the show notes. I'd encourage you to go and look at some of the numbers and
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.320]   things in his writings, but it's very accessible. He's explaining some detailed concepts in
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.400]   a very accessible way, and so I just encourage people, go and read it, but don't expect today
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.680]   to be fluffy. We're going to try to give you some useful strategies that you can implement
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.940]   immediately.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.040]   So first off, though, Brandon, sorry for a generic question, but tell us a little bit
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.940]   about yourself and a little bit about your financial journey. Where'd you start from?
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.400]   How long have you been interested in financial independence? Where are you at in your progress?
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.080]   Kind of just give us a little bit of background so we can understand who you are and where
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080]   you're coming from.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:38.320]   Sure, yeah. I'm 31 years old. I studied computer science in college, and I actually studied
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.560]   abroad in Glasgow, Scotland when I was a junior. When I was over there, I met a Scottish girl
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.920]   and came back to the States for my senior year and graduated, and then I moved to Scotland.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.120]   So we spent about four years living over there, and then I brought her over to the States,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.880]   and then we just got married last year. So after 10 years of being together, we just
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   got married.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.880]   Congratulations.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.440]   Thank you. Yeah, married life's been good. We just had our one-year anniversary there
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.240]   just a little bit ago last month, so yeah, things are good with that.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.800]   As far as when did I start my journey to financial independence, I've always been quite frugal,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.920]   and I've always loved looking into money. Even as a kid, I couldn't wait till I had
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:41.360]   a portfolio to manage and have money to do things with and watch it grow. So I've never
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.680]   been a big spender. But the actual journey itself to financial
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.640]   independence probably maybe three or four years ago. I came across Early Retirement
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.520]   Extreme, which is � I just listened to your episode on his book review, which was excellent.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.360]   I came across his blog, and it was only then that I really thought, "Whoa, that's actually
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.560]   possible." Up until that point, not spending a lot of money, I would take off six months
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.880]   at a time. In between jobs, I would quit. Obviously, moving between America and Scotland,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.120]   that gave perfect opportunities just to go do fun things in between those times.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.280]   So I always used my money for freedom in that sense, but it was never a focused goal to,
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.360]   "Okay, I'm going to just work really hard for this time, and then I'll have freedom
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.040]   for the rest of my life." It was always like, "Work a bit, have a bit of freedom. Work a
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.240]   bit, have a bit of freedom."
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.640]   >> Trevor: It's really interesting how a lot of times there has to be some kind of catalytic
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.680]   event like reading a story like Jacob's or reading something or hearing somebody or talking
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.400]   to somebody. This show is not designed to be the Early Retirement or Early Financial
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.000]   Independence show, but I'm enjoying some of these conversations because by realizing how
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.680]   quickly it is possible – Jacob's story is excellent. He gives a very good, detailed
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.480]   kind of defense that it is possible and you don't have to be some investment wizard
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.400]   to accomplish that goal. But by realizing what's possible, I believe that all of us
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.960]   can look at our specific goals and understand what's important to us with a much bigger
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.040]   realization of the parameters that are possible. Not all of us are going to pursue Jacob's
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.920]   lifestyle. I'm probably not going to pursue your approach, but I learn from everyone's
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.240]   approach. I think that's one of the goals I have for this podcast is to help people
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   be exposed to stories and conversations with people who are doing it and seeing how they're
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.360]   doing it so that we can start with our own goals and say, "What do we want?" and
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.840]   really feel confident about setting those plans. It's neat that that was a transformative
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.920]   event in your life as far as his writings. I'm sure that would make him feel good.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:14.000]   Oh, absolutely. It completely changed everything. As you said, I definitely don't plan on
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.920]   living this style of life that Jacob does, but he's shown me what's possible as far
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   as just making choices that make you happy rather than just doing what everybody else
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   seems to be doing. I'm sure I could have continued doing what I was doing so far as
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   just working a few years and then going off and having a great time for a little while
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.920]   and then working a few more. But I definitely like the new plan of just working really hard
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.480]   and then having the rest of my life to do as I wish.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.560]   And the working in breaks thing I think is a very valid strategy. It's actually a
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.120]   strategy that I'm more interested in than some of the other strategies. It makes sense
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.640]   to me to spend a number of years working at a project and then to spend some time working
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.600]   on a different project. Even with the more normal US-American career path, all of us
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.000]   – I guess the articles you read say that all of us are going to have multiple careers,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.200]   multiple jobs in totally different fields. So that type of approach works well.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.080]   But I'll give you a quick bit of insight. I don't think I'm betraying anything personal,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.960]   but I kind of chuckled. After I reviewed Jacob's book, I reached out to him via email. I shot
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.560]   him an email and asked him for an interview. He was very kind, but he made a comment in
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:45.240]   his note. He said, "I don't really think much about early retirement anymore." He
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.320]   declined the interview for right now. I'm hoping in the future he'll do it. But he
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.760]   said, "At some point I may come back and start thinking about this stuff again, but
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   I'm not really active in thinking about it or planning for it. So I don't think
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.280]   I'd be a good resource right now."
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.120]   I had to laugh because for many people, my belief is that by pursuing a strategy like
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.640]   his and a strategy like you're pursuing, it can set you free to kind of, instead of
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.160]   worrying about money and making all the decisions about money, then you can make decisions based
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.000]   upon what you're really interested in.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.240]   So Jacob, my understanding from his blog is he's currently working. He's doing some
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.680]   sort of trading up in Chicago, I think. But he's doing it because it's something that
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.520]   he's interested in, not because he has to. I thought it's so interesting that once
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.040]   he's achieved financial independence at a young age, he kind of just forgets about
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.920]   it. Instead of it becoming this huge monumental thing of, "I've got a plan for this,"
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:48.360]   it's just simply life. I thought what a cool testament to, I would love it if many
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.600]   young people would pursue a strategy like you're pursuing. I believe that free of
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.680]   some of the financial baggage and the concerns and the money troubles that a lot of people
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.480]   face, I think we would have a far more productive society of inventors and scientists and teachers
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.760]   and people sharing and helping society grow because they're in a position to pursue
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.160]   things that they're really interested in and passionate about instead of just pursuing
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.640]   things to earn the money that they need for this week.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.240]   Oh, absolutely. Yeah, the fact that Jacob's gone back to work is just, yeah, he's doing
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   exactly what he wants to do. I know he really hates that he called his blog, Early Retirement
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.720]   Extreme because the retirement word has so much baggage associated with it, which is
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.920]   why I definitely try to save financial independence as much as possible because I have a whole
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:45.480]   list of jobs that I'm looking forward to pursuing after financial independence. I'm
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.440]   sure I could do it now and I'd still be living a happy life, but I think there's
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.200]   something about getting a degree in something and then feeling that you need to maximize
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.360]   that investment of time and money. It's like, "All right, well, if I use my degree
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.020]   to then achieve financial independence, then I can go do all these other fun things that
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.840]   I'll get paid for, but really I'll be going there just to learn something new or meet
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:17.680]   new people or have new experiences." That, to me, is the best part of financial independence
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:25.480]   is the option to do that. I have no desire to just sit and watch TV all day. I expect
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.960]   I'll probably be even busier after financial independence than I am now, but it'll just
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.920]   be on things that are very important to me and things that keep my brain occupied and
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.920]   happy.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:43.520]   >> Trevor: Yeah, absolutely. Walk us through, and this is going to be a little bit personal,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.960]   but since you wrote it and published it in public, I don't feel bad about asking you
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.520]   through it. You sat down at some point over the last couple of years and really spent
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:00.480]   some time trying to envision and create your perfect life, as you put it. Walk us through
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.640]   what that looks like for you, and I'm sure it'll change, so don't feel like you're
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.600]   lumped into a corner here, but walk us through the process of how you sat down first and
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.360]   started working on it and then what you think of, with you and your wife, what feels like
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.320]   and looks like the perfect life for you guys.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.040]   >> Tom: Sure. Yeah, no, this was a really, really good exercise, and I definitely encourage
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:26.480]   anyone to do it. It's actually a lot harder than it sounds. You think you know what you
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.120]   want, but when you really sit down and try to picture three months of something that's
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.080]   the same and doing the same thing, it's like the stuff you thought you wanted to be doing
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.920]   may not actually be the stuff you actually want to be doing. It was definitely a really
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:49.680]   cool exercise, and yeah, it sort of came from ... It was just a natural progression, I think,
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.560]   once I knew that, okay, freedom's the number one thing. That's what I'm working towards,
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.680]   just saving up the money, and then I'll have the freedom to do whatever I want. But then
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.480]   it's like, all right, well, what do I actually want to do? If work factors into that, then
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:11.520]   why not account for that and start my perfect life sooner? You know what I mean? So rather
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.760]   than think, all right, I just got to save up X amount of dollars so that I can spend
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:22.080]   Y amount every year, if I'm going to be working part-time doing something that I enjoy, I
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.960]   should probably try to factor that money in. So yeah, for a good few months, we just kept
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.940]   talking, my wife and I, just talking about different sorts of plans and what's really
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:42.720]   important to us. So yeah, to sum up where we are right now, we realized that the things
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.880]   that make us happiest are being around people that we love and doing and trying new things
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.640]   that are challenging. So since her family's in Scotland, my family's in America, we're
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.760]   never going to be able to live somewhere where both of us are completely happy as far as
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:06.200]   being able to see all the people that we want to see. So we thought, all right, well, let's
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.720]   think about this. We can spend a few months here and there if we need to. We're going
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.840]   to have the flexibility to do that. So yeah, we came up with what we call the 363 plan,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.920]   which means that we're going to spend three months in America just traveling around, seeing
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.480]   my friends and family and staying with them and spending some good quality time with them.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:39.800]   We're going to go spend six months in Scotland to see my wife's family and our friends over
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.640]   there. My wife will then work during that six months, which I'll come back to and talk
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:52.000]   about. And then we'll spend three months somewhere else in the world. We'll establish a base
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.760]   somewhere in a region that we want to explore. And then we'll try to live like locals as
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.240]   much as we can and just do little side trips outside of there and maybe try to learn some
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:11.600]   languages and pick up new skills when we're abroad. So that's where we stand right now.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.000]   And we're actually planning for that first year of the 363 plan.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.240]   I'll come back to my wife working. I write about this in a couple of posts actually,
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:31.840]   but the entire 10 plus years we've been together, we've had separate finances. I've obviously
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:41.840]   been pretty extreme in my savings rate ever since we met. My wife hadn't been that extreme.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:49.280]   She was quite a normal person before all these ideas started rubbing off on her. It always
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.920]   just worked best for us to have separate finances because then that way we're both contributing
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.120]   equal amounts to the bills, but then I can go off and save the rest of mine and she could
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.000]   spend it or save it or whatever she wanted to do with it.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.480]   So she's actually not going to be financially independent, which is why we are going to
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:17.680]   be living in Scotland for six months so she can work and see her family. And she enjoys
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.000]   her work a lot more than I think I do. So she's not too sad about it. I'm not too sad
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.560]   about it because I love spending time in Scotland.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.600]   What type of field of work is she in?
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.280]   She's an optometrist. So she'll be able to easily pick up, they're called locums in Scotland,
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.480]   which is I guess just like, you know, if a practice needs an extra optometrist for a
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   week or a day or a weekend or something, they can just call these people that don't have
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:50.880]   permanent jobs somewhere and they can just come in and sub in for a week or whatever.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   So that works out quite well.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:16:00.680]   Yeah, that's really neat. And I want to riff off of that for a second because is she currently
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.720]   working a full-time practice where like it's her practice or she's currently doing some
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.940]   sort of occasional employment?
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.820]   She's working full-time. It's not her practice but she's working as an optometrist at someone
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:19.580]   else's practice. But yeah, she's full-time and she will be until we make our move abroad
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.580]   at the end of next year.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:27.300]   Okay. So you mentioned for both you and for her in your article you've mentioned that
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:33.360]   you are working towards being able to live off of your investment income but you're also
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.560]   interested in building up sources of income that allow you to not depend on your investment
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:43.940]   income so much. And I think and also even just what you said about your wife's potential
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.700]   income in the future of doing a part-time. It's such a valuable strategy is that there
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.420]   are many ways, I think there are many ways to financial independence. One way which is
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:59.860]   maybe kind of the ultimate is to be in a position where the income off of your investments will
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.140]   flow in and support your living expenses. That's awesome.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:08.440]   For young people, it's perhaps a little bit daunting. You can also set up a lifestyle
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.420]   that's a part-time or seasonal employment. So if this is like you said of six months
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:18.400]   a year working at something like that, if you develop the skills, I've seen what comes
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.980]   to mind right now is accountants who work during tax season and arrange their living
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.960]   expenses that they don't need to work year round. I think you're in software developers,
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.320]   people who can work anywhere, writers. There are so many careers that can be done on a
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.840]   seasonal basis if people seek that out. That's such an important strategy for people to understand
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.920]   what their skills are. And then it may be that the right move is to move into a corporate
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.540]   50-week a year position or maybe the right move to take those skills and build something
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.440]   up that's able to be done part-time.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.920]   Part-time is actually something I'm going to be investigating. I think the more and
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.280]   more I think about it, the more and more it makes sense to maybe transition into financial
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:14.600]   independence that way. It's probably a big change, obviously, and there's probably
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.920]   a lot of weird emotions that go along with it. It's mostly exciting, but I'm sure it's
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   going to be a little scary as well. The idea of working part-time really appeals to me,
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:34.760]   one for tax purposes, just to maybe rather than just work a full year as your last year
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   before financial independence, maybe just work two half years, save a bunch of money
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.320]   on taxes and then slowly work your way into a new lifestyle. That's not a big change,
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.360]   a drastic change from what you're doing.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:53.160]   I completely agree, and especially in the Internet age, there's so many more opportunities
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:59.920]   to do pick-up part-time work or even just work 20 hours a week doing something or whatever,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.400]   take half the year off. There's many, many options, which is very nice in this day and
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   age.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.760]   You see people doing this at every level of wealth scale. You see people doing this that
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.400]   are maybe just getting started, whether it's your stereotypical surf bum. I'll pick on
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.760]   surf bum because I think they're neat people. You spend six months waiting tables so you
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.400]   can spend six months surfing. You see it if you read the literature and talk to people
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:34.360]   who are very wealthy, who have very high-profile corporate jobs, things like that. Most CEOs,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:41.760]   if they retire from working a company, don't simply quit and stop working. Most CEOs have
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:48.280]   other projects that they do. I always enjoyed reading Jack Welch, who was the CEO of General
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:56.320]   Electric. He writes columns for one of the Business Week magazines. He records a podcast.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.360]   He's active in consulting projects. A lot of times you'll have a CEO who will retire
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:06.480]   from a leadership position in a company and that person will serve on boards. They'll
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.320]   serve on three or four boards where they're earning an income.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:17.200]   You find a lot of times that there's more to work than just money. The money is obviously
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.000]   really valuable, but there's also a certain fulfillment. There's also a certain activity,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.360]   feeling like contributing to society. Those things are very valid, but many times people
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.640]   don't realize that it's available sooner than later. It's not just something that you have
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:41.280]   to do from 65 to 75. It's something that you can do from 30 to 40 if you want to. That's
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.320]   up to each individual's goals. I think it's neat that you guys are factoring that into
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   your planning.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.520]   Mad Fientist Absolutely. What you said about work is definitely
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:56.920]   true. It's actually amazing. It's something that I didn't expect out of pursuing financial
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.040]   independence. As I get closer and closer to that goal, I'm enjoying my job a lot more
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.680]   and more because I know I'm not going to be stuck in there doing the same thing for 30
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:14.720]   years. As I get closer to the end, I actually really do enjoy what I'm doing. Especially
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:23.880]   now that I'm to a point where it'd be fine if I just wanted to quit. I don't get angry
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.160]   as much as all the annoying office stuff that goes on. I just do my own thing. I still do
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.680]   good work, but I don't deal with all the bullshit that usually goes on just because I don't
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:44.320]   have to. If they want to fire me, they can fire me. It's sort of like that office space.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.960]   As that guy cared less and less, they liked him more and more. That's honestly what I'm
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:54.520]   finding. I'm not doing all the ass-kissing that everybody else is doing and all the normal
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:03.680]   stuff. I'm just doing the work that I enjoy. My bosses are happier than they've ever been.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:10.920]   It's a weird thing. It's a very cool perk of getting close to financial independence.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.800]   Like I said, I'm enjoying my job more than I have in a decade.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:22.520]   That's awesome. Now, you were talking about your wife. You said that she's not a scientist,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.560]   but you also said that maybe she's changing a little bit. What are you finding as you
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.920]   guys spend more time together? Are you finding that she's becoming attracted to your lifestyle
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.720]   more and more? Is she changing to that? What are you finding as the path there?
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:46.680]   Absolutely. It's actually a very big surprise. I have a post on my site called an unexpected
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:53.960]   guest post. I was just up one night. I was writing an article. My wife said she was going
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.880]   to bed, so she just kissed me goodnight. She's like, "There's something on my computer that
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.800]   I want you to read." I was like, "Oh, okay. What is it?" She's like, "Just read it."
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:09.720]   She went off to bed. I tried to finish the article that I was writing, but curiosity
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.080]   quickly got the better of me because I was like, "What could this possibly be?" So, I
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:23.640]   read. It was just this letter to me that was just talking about her feelings. I think she
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.280]   said she got up in the middle of the night one night because she had so much on her mind,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:33.720]   and she just started writing this. I was sleeping, so she just typed this out on her computer.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:41.280]   It was like I got to watch the light bulb go off in her head as far as why I'm doing
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.680]   this. Like I said, we've been together for 10 plus years. For that entire time, I've
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:55.120]   been the same, just watching my money very closely, not buying a lot of stuff, trying
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.040]   to save as much as possible. Like I said, she wasn't like that, so she didn't really
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:08.160]   understand it. We always had separate finances, so I never tried to force her to do anything
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:13.480]   that she didn't want to do. We never really talked about it.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:20.520]   Ever since I started writing on The Mad Scientist, she's my editor, so she gets to read all my
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.680]   articles before I post them just to try to snag any misspellings or anything like that.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.000]   So yeah, I guess it started to sink in. Doing the podcast and interviewing other people
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.680]   that had pursued financial independence, she got to hear from other people besides me saying,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.320]   "This is why I'm doing it as well." We also got to meet up with Jim Collins from
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.880]   JLCollinsNH.com. I interviewed him for the podcast, and he actually lives quite close,
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:53.320]   so we met up with him and his wife and had some good dinner conversations about this
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.440]   stuff. I think it just started to gradually click.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.040]   Like, "Oh, he's not just doing it because he's a cheapskate. He's doing it because
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:09.080]   he wants to let his money grow and then use the interest off the money to actually do
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.840]   what he wants without working." So yeah, it started to sink in, but it wasn't
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:21.040]   until we really started planning out our perfect life that she started realizing. Because like
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.240]   I said before, she loves what she does. She loves working. So to her, it was like, "Well,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:32.080]   why shouldn't I buy something that I want? Because I'll make more money, and I always
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.120]   like my job, so making more money is not a problem for me, so why not just spend it?"
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:43.200]   But when we started seeing that, "Look, this could actually give us six months for
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.440]   you of not working at all, spending more time with friends and family than we do now, seeing
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.760]   more places than we see now while still allowing you to be an optometrist," then it really
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   sunk in. And yeah, now she's just totally behind the
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:07.240]   idea. Her spending has completely changed. She wasn't going crazy before, but she's
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:17.280]   definitely more conscious of what she's spending her money on and when. So yeah, that's one
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.200]   of the biggest benefits of actually starting to write about this stuff, was that yeah,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.120]   I think it really got her on board, and now we're in this together, which is great.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.520]   >> Trevor: Yeah, and it's neat that you can share that story, because a lot of times when
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:41.920]   people talk about financial planning, many people see frugality and saving and investing
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:49.000]   as a sacrifice, and they see it as a sacrifice of something that they want. I thought I enjoyed
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.880]   that. Next, we're going to go to your triple value of income article, because I thought
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.880]   that was a good way to talk about it, but I'll set you up for it.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.680]   I think the people who are, many people who are frugal, and many people who are pursuing
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:09.920]   strategies like you are, don't view it as sacrifice, but they view it more as a way
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.240]   for them to get what they really want. My philosophy, personally, is I think, I just
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:23.920]   recorded a show on the ultimate smart person's guide to spending money. How I started that
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.880]   show is I said, "When is it okay for you to spend money?" My answer is, "Whenever
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.440]   you want." It's your money. You can do what you want with it. I don't think there's
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:38.560]   anything necessarily better about saving it versus spending it, but the key is that are
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.840]   you saving it because you want to save it, or are you spending it because that's what's
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:49.600]   important to you? My favorite example that I've thought for years about was, and I've
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.720]   mentioned a few times on the show, was Chris Guillebeau's example of, "Would I rather
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:59.160]   travel to 100 countries, or would I rather drive an SUV?"
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.520]   Many people say, "I would love to travel. I want to travel, but I can't afford to
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:09.960]   travel." Many people drive SUVs. I believe many times no one's ever asked them, "Have
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:16.680]   you considered that you actually want to drive the SUV? If you do, get the SUV. Do you want
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.920]   to visit 100 countries? If you do, here's a way that you could achieve it." Probably
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:27.080]   for you, I dare say that being frugal and saving and investing a large percentage of
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.960]   your income is not necessarily a sacrifice, but it's a way for you to achieve what's
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.200]   more important to you than the current gratification of spending money.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.640]   Absolutely. That's a perfect way to say it. Paula from Afford Anything, she has a really
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.040]   cool article on that. I forget the name of it, but I'll send you a link afterwards.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.200]   It talks about how when she said she was going to go travel for two years, all of her friends
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.520]   were like, "How can you afford that? What are you talking about? What are you doing?"
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.200]   Yet all of her friends were going out and buying a $30,000 SUV, and nobody was saying
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.840]   to them, "Whoa, how can you afford that? What are you doing? How do you do that?"
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:11.360]   There's all these things that society has just ingrained in our mind that are normal.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.720]   Most people probably, if they actually sat down and realized how much it was costing
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:22.440]   them and what they were giving up to do it, they might think differently.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.640]   You're absolutely right. It's not a sacrifice. Actually, the more and more that I cut back
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.960]   – I started as frugal, but now with the goal so close in sight, I'm still dialing
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:42.560]   more and more back. As I do, I'm getting happier and happier. I feel freer, less stressed,
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:49.840]   less worried. It's got to the point where I'm thinking, rather than keep whittling
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:56.960]   down to reach the sweet spot, at this point, I may be better just giving up everything
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.880]   and then only picking up the things that I really miss. That may be more efficient to
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:12.540]   get to the sweet spot that way. It's not hard. With such an amazing goal in the finish
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:17.480]   line so close, it's so easy not to go out and spend a bunch of money on stuff that's
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.600]   not important to me.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.960]   You mentioned the triple value of income article. That's actually where it all started pretty
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:34.040]   much. My mom, I was speaking to her one day and something came up and I said I wasn't
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.160]   going to spend any money on it or something. She's like, "Why don't you just go out
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:44.320]   and buy something to make yourself happy?" I thought a lot about it and I'm like, "That
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:51.800]   would not make me happy." I wanted to figure out a way to explain it. I started thinking
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:58.280]   and I'm like, "If I spend the dollar, then it's gone and I have this thing that I'm
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.360]   probably not going to be that into in a few weeks. Or, if I keep the dollar, that dollar
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.720]   is going to actually be worth X amount when I actually spend it, depending on if I put
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.760]   it into a retirement account or if I put it into a normal investment account."
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:21.600]   I wrote the triple value of income post to show that, if I forget the numbers I used,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:28.120]   but say you make $100,000 a year, that $100,000 is actually only worth $80,000 to you because
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:35.240]   you have to pay $20,000 in tax. But if you instead funnel a lot of that into tax advantage
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.360]   accounts, then you're getting the full value of your dollar plus all of the interest that
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:48.960]   you would accrue while it's in those accounts. It seemed like a really good way to explain
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.240]   why I don't feel like I need to spend money because I'm just delaying my gratification
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.920]   for more gratification later for the same dollars.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:07.160]   >> Trevor: It's interesting because I think if you find people who really enjoy saving
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.080]   and investing and building their money, a lot of times it's their hobby. It's something
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.480]   that they derive a lot of benefit out of. The benefit is either the fun of it or the
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.920]   benefit is what it can get them in the future. I want to walk through, because I really enjoyed
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:29.120]   that post, some of the specifics of how you – and I'm not sure if you can pull it
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:35.600]   up on your screen. If not, I can read it to you. Walk through the numbers that you used
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.320]   regarding spending, investing, retirement contributions, employer match, and investment
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:46.040]   income and how that multiplied. This is a really valuable concept for me. I think of
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:51.840]   it as stacking functions, which is a permaculture concept, stacking as many functions as possible
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.880]   and getting maximum use out of the dollar. Walk us through your actual numbers that you
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   used in that post.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:03.440]   >> Trevor: Sure. I got it up. I have it in front of me. I obviously didn't take into
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.680]   the time value of money or anything like that. It was more just an exercise to show how much
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:18.400]   value you could extract from – I think it was $100,000 salary. As I mentioned before,
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:24.600]   if you spend all of that $100,000, you're going to at most probably get $80,000 of value
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.320]   out of it because of all the tax you're going to have to pay. It's probably even
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:38.600]   more than that. That was just a – what am I trying to say? It was a rough estimate of
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   the tax.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   >> Trevor: Yeah.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:46.080]   >> Trevor: Yeah. Just assuming that, just assuming an effective tax rate of 20%, you're
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:54.520]   only going to be able to buy $80,000 worth of stuff. Then I thought, "All right. Let's
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:04.080]   go another direction." If you instead invested one of those dollars that you earned, you'd
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.960]   still only be getting $0.80 of value out of it because you would pay tax on it. But then
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:16.640]   assuming you left it grow for 10 years earning the 7% average stock market rate of return,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:24.800]   that dollar would actually be $1.57 when you came to spend it, which would provide – oh,
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.960]   yeah. But you would then have to pay tax on that. Oh, no. The capital gains tax. Assuming
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:37.240]   capital gains tax. You'd roughly have like $1.45 of value out of it.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.720]   If you invested for 10 years rather than just spending it as soon as you make it, you're
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:47.680]   actually going to get $1.45 instead of $0.80, which is quite a big difference, especially
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:54.360]   for only 10 years of waiting. But you can actually do better than that. There are lots
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:00.960]   of tax advantage accounts that you can utilize, which is something I like to focus on because
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:10.280]   that's a very easy and surefire way of getting more bang for your buck.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:17.560]   The next section I talked about are retirement contributions. If I instead took one of those
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:22.120]   dollars and rather than spending it and getting $0.80 of value or investing it and getting
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:32.000]   $1.45 of value in 10 years, if I instead put it into my 401(k), then I'm initially still
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   getting a dollar's worth of shares because I'm not paying tax on that dollar. Then again,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.120]   spending the same rate of return, after 30 years, I would end up getting $6.70 worth
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:52.960]   of value out of that dollar. $0.80 as opposed to $6.70 is a very big difference.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:00.920]   I then talked about most people who work full-time have an employer match for their 401(k). The
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:10.320]   first 5% or whatever gets matched by the employer. If I had that, that initial dollar, I wouldn't
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.760]   get taxed on it. My employer would match me, so that would turn into $2 right off the bat.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:29.080]   Then if I invested it until standard retirement age in 30 years, it would be $13.39.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.640]   That initial $0.80 that I could have just spent and then been bored with whatever I
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:42.240]   bought, I instead can put that in my 401(k) and then get $13.39 of value from that single
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:49.480]   dollar. I'm not going to need $13.39 for that dollar probably by the time I'm 65 or 59.5
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:56.920]   or whenever I decide to take it out. I could instead live off the interest from that dollar.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:10.440]   I worked it out. Assuming a 3.5% yield, I could get $0.80 every two years. Every two
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.280]   years, I would be getting the same amount of value out of that dollar as I would have
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.400]   got if I would have just spent it and then lost it forever back when I earned it.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:26.640]   Adding all of this stuff up using all of the various contribution limits at the time, the
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:33.320]   contribution limits have actually increased. This was 2012, maybe I wrote this. Totaling
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:42.960]   all of that up, if you maxed out all of your 401(k)s, your IRAs, your HSAs, and then you
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:50.800]   only spent $25,000 a year and then invested the rest in taxable accounts, you'd end up
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:38:00.600]   getting over $249,000 of value as I've described it out of that $100,000 salary that had you
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.880]   spent it all, you would only get $80,000 of value.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:11.760]   You've given yourself three times as much salary without having any more work to do
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:21.400]   or working more hours or doing anything else differently just by intelligently making sure
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.800]   those dollars are actually going to work for you over the long run.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:30.920]   >> Trevor: I'm going to add to this with a philosophy that I think is important because
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.480]   what I like about this is you said you're 31. This is so important. I feel this is so
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:43.800]   important when we're 30 years old. It's a little different if you're later in life.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.720]   The reason why this is so important is that money has a much greater utility at a younger
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:57.280]   age than at an older age. My favorite name for this, I'm going to borrow from Joshua
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:03.520]   Kinnon who calls it the red ring problem. The red ring problem is getting rich too late
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.960]   in life. I'll link to an article that he wrote on this in the show notes so people
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:12.800]   can read his article. The red ring comes from a video game and the idea is that basically
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.300]   near the end of the video game, you can find this red ring that increases your ability
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:25.080]   hugely and makes the game extremely easy. Life is kind of like that. The red ring problem
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.960]   is what's the point of saving money or investing money if I'm only going to get to enjoy it
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:37.840]   when I'm too old to care. This is so valuable at an early age to do these types of hacks
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.960]   or whatever you want to call them, optimization strategies at an older age is going to change.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:48.880]   The value of your dollar at 30 years old where you can turn the $100,000 into a value of
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.800]   $249,000 is crucial to building wealth in the early age. It's going to be different
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:05.240]   if you were 70 years old. The $100,000 at 70 is probably more useful for rational expenses
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:13.120]   rather than the $249,000 at the age of 110. You can't ignore the concept at 30, otherwise
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.880]   you never get to enjoy those higher dollars.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:23.720]   Absolutely. Very, very important. The earlier you start, the easier it is. That's definitely
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   the case.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:34.040]   There's no right or wrong here, but I like the fact. I have a good friend of mine who's
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:40.800]   a little bit older. It's interesting with your $100,000 example. This good friend of
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:47.240]   mine, he's older, he's quite wealthy. Most people would consider him to be quite wealthy.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:53.920]   He has a boating habit. I live down here in Florida. He lives in Florida as well. He really
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:01.000]   enjoys large expensive boats. He has a boating habit that costs him in excess of six figures
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.260]   a year. It's a nice boat and he enjoys it. With this in excess of six figures a year,
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:13.480]   he actually continues to work part time so that he can support that boating habit.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:19.000]   To me, the reason I'm bringing this up is because, just to hammer home for the 83rd
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.800]   time, either one of these is fine. At this stage in your life, at 30 years old, the $100,000
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.720]   for you is to get the triple value and to build it up in the future because that's
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:36.200]   more valuable. For my friend who's in his late 60s, for him the $100,000 is far more
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:42.760]   better served. He gets far more value out of it by allowing him to enjoy a luxurious
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:49.320]   lifestyle on the water. You've got to do it in an intelligent way. At a younger age,
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:54.800]   I think most folks, it's so valuable to understand the math between what you've laid out and
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:01.400]   understand how by working that math at 30, it puts you in a position at 40, 50, 60, and
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:08.680]   70 where you're able to enjoy the utility of that for a much enhanced lifestyle.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.920]   Mad Fientist Absolutely. I couldn't have said it better
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.320]   myself. Your friend with the boat, that's something I've been thinking about as well
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:25.200]   recently that I thought it would make an interesting article. I assume he owns his own boat and
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.800]   he still spends $100,000 a year?
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.360]   J. MoneyLine Correct. That's not the acquisition cost.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.640]   That's the running cost per year.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.960]   Mad Fientist I don't know anything about renting boats,
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:42.360]   but I imagine you could probably rent a pretty amazing boat for $100,000 a year. Not obviously
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.520]   for the entire year, but whenever you wanted to use it and not have to deal with all the
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.560]   other garbage of keeping it and all of that stuff. I imagine you could probably do it
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.680]   for less than $100,000, but maybe obviously you wouldn't be able to just think, "Oh, I'm
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.240]   going to go on my boat right now," and then go on it. There's obviously trade-offs.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:08.360]   A lot of people's very expensive hobbies and things like time shares and things like that
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:16.120]   where you're only using it a bit or RVs and things like that. I wonder if they've thought
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.400]   about renting before, just go ahead and buying and did the numbers as far as you could probably
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.840]   rent some pretty cool things and then not get sick of them.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.640]   J. MoneyLine Yeah. You're going to love my Smart Persons
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.960]   Guide to Spending Money show because here would be a couple different ways that you
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:39.520]   could do it. I'm not a boating person, so I'm with you as far as I would usually rather
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:47.720]   rent stuff like that because I would enjoy it. Now, it's challenging to hit the boat.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:53.800]   Again, I'm down here in South Florida. We're talking about a 45-foot type of sport fishing
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:59.200]   boat. To charter one of those, you can charter it and you can go out and you can charter
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.560]   it for the weekend. You can charter it and you can do it and you can have a lot of fun
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   on that.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.280]   But you can also flip it around and for the right situation, somebody with a boat like
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.800]   that, if somebody has a business, that boat can be an extension of their business, something
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   that they use to entertain clients and something that they can use to entertain customers and
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.640]   clients. It could also be something where it's a business in and of itself.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.400]   So you can buy the boat if you have the cash to buy the boat and you can turn around and
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.600]   you can charter it out yourself. Well, because you're charting it out yourself, number one
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:41.920]   is you can turn it from an expense into potentially an income or you can use it as a – how do
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:49.840]   I put this appropriately? You can use it as a business which is designed to be profitable
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:57.880]   but allows some of your expenses to be absorbed by the business side of the tax code.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   Absolutely.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.600]   At some point in the future, I'm going to do a detailed show on tax planning but one
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.520]   of the most valuable things for people to do who are interested in luxuries is if you
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.400]   have a luxury that you enjoy and this is something that's important to you, whether it's big
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.440]   boats or racing cars or something like that, one of the most beneficial things you can
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.000]   do is you can say, "How can I take my luxury and how can I turn it into a business?"
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.760]   So if I enjoy operating a boat, it's very possible that I may enjoy operating the boat
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.960]   and being out on the water just as much if I have five paying clients on board with me
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:35.560]   versus me just simply being out there with just myself or with three or four of my buddies.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.600]   By taking something like that and turning it from an expense over into a business and
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.000]   by running it in a business-like manner, following the tax rules very carefully, keeping good
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.680]   records, you can take and you can legitimately turn the expense and move it over onto a business
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   return where you have basically just like you would enjoy instead of spending your money
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.720]   in a taxable world, you can take that expenditure which would cost you $0.80, which would cost
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:09.360]   you $0.10 if you were doing it in a taxable world to turn that expenditure into an $0.80
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.840]   expenditure in the business world.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.800]   There's a lot that you can do with it.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:20.560]   If you keep good records, you can use your business assets and you can use them for both
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.640]   on the business side, but you can also get the personal enjoyment out of them as well.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.080]   Mad Fientist That's great.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:32.600]   I'm definitely excited to listen to your Smart Spending Money podcast because that's an excellent
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:39.360]   strategy and that's an awesome way to have an expensive hobby.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.240]   David Steinberg The key is knowing what the rules are and
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.400]   knowing what you want.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.560]   I personally have zero interest in ever pursuing that course of action because I don't enjoy
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.080]   voting that much, but for somebody who that's important to them and they want to do it,
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.600]   look for a way to do it intelligently and look for a way to stack these functions on
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:06.640]   top where instead of having something be a large expense, can you make it into an income
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   stream.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:15.200]   There are lots of ways that people can do that and do it very intelligently.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.160]   Mad Fientist That's exactly what we plan to do.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.280]   Travel is our biggest passion.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.760]   Definitely we don't have many hobbies, but we love to go and see new places and experience
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.320]   new things.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:32.720]   Travel was probably my biggest expense of my 20s.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.960]   We're flipping that around and we're going to use it to come out further ahead than if
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:44.200]   we didn't travel because like I said, we're going to go and spend three months plus at
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:50.360]   these different places that we've always wanted to go and see, but we're going to live like
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:56.000]   locals so we're going to be able to get apartments rather than hotels and the flight cost will
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.680]   be minimal not only because I'm quite good at travel hacking, but just because it's one
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.720]   flight over three to six months rather than most people take one flight over one or two
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   weeks for their vacations and that obviously jacks up the price of the trip.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:19.440]   Plus there's just tons of cheap but very interesting places to live in the world that we're going
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:25.080]   to end up spending less money day to day living there than we would living in the States or
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   in Scotland.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:32.920]   So yeah, we're trying to turn our biggest passion not into a business but use it in
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.120]   a way that it will actually help us financially as well.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   >> Trevor: Absolutely.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.280]   So let me go to your article there on travel hacking because this was a great article.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:48.960]   The trip that you recently did is you recently took a trip and you flew from Boston to Ireland
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.240]   and used some strategies and I think the strategies will be a little too detailed for the air,
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.800]   but in the article you flew from Boston to Dublin and then from Dublin to Glasgow and
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:04.080]   you stayed a couple nights in a five star London hotel and your total out of pocket
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.800]   cost was how much?
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.240]   >> Chris: Less than 150 each for all of that.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.840]   >> Trevor: And that would have been purchased at retail would have been about 2000 bucks
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   each, something like that?
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:21.080]   >> Chris: Let's see, that would have been over a grand each definitely.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:27.160]   A Boston to Dublin flight usually if you're lucky you can get it maybe for 7800.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:33.920]   At the time when I booked it, I record everything I do just to see how much money I'm actually
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   saving.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:43.960]   So at the time I think two of those tickets would have cost 1692.38.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:49.480]   So we ended up saving 1450 by using miles.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.680]   So yeah, that would have been over 1600 just for the flights from Boston to Dublin because
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:50:01.400]   it was summertime, it's America to Europe, that's not a cheap trip.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:07.160]   And then from Dublin we went to Glasgow because that's where my wife's family is, but my sister
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.120]   was studying abroad in London at the time so we wanted to stop in London.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:20.320]   So yeah, a one-way ticket from Dublin to London and London to Glasgow, that would have been
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.800]   over 200 bucks each or close to 200 bucks each I think.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.600]   And then two nights in a five-star hotel right in Leicester Square, it was gorgeous, it was
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.600]   beautiful.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   The actual cost of the room was 974 for two nights, but we didn't pay anything.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.920]   We used miles, I'm trying to see here.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.600]   Oh yeah, I wrote on the post that we saved 240 because there's no way we would have spent
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.440]   974 to stay in a five-star hotel had we been paying.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.840]   But yeah, the actual cost of that room for two nights on that weekend that we were there
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.840]   was 974.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:08.440]   So yeah, the only thing we did pay was tax on the flights and absolutely nothing on the
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   hotel.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:15.960]   So yeah, it was less than 150 each and it was an amazing trip and it was cheap once
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.880]   we got there obviously because we were just staying with my wife's family.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.080]   Yeah, it was amazing.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:28.560]   So yeah, travel hacking is one of those hobbies that you mentioned earlier that saves you
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.640]   money but it can be a hobby.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:38.320]   It's actually a lot of fun and there's lots to it and could keep you occupied for a while
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:44.360]   and there's nothing better than waking up in a five-star hotel and seeing all the people
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:50.360]   around you and thinking that they spent a fortune and you didn't spend a penny.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.880]   This article, the travel hacking using the credit cards and the miles and the points
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.120]   is something that it's a topic that fascinates me.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.640]   I am not actively doing it but it fascinates me.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.520]   I'll give you a book that I just finished that you may, I don't know if you read or
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:12.120]   not, but the author of that book goes through some of his deals and how he did them.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.800]   The book is called Get More, Spend Less and the author, I think his name is Brad Wilson.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   He writes at bradsdeals.com.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Have you heard of that book?
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   No, I've not.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   It sounds interesting though.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   Check it out.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   I think you would enjoy it.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:31.200]   I think you would enjoy it because he goes through some of his deals and his deals are
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.360]   like yours, incredible.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:40.320]   He goes through some of his, he's pretty hardcore about it, very extreme and you'll love his
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.440]   story and I'll do a review on that book at some point here.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:49.880]   Also, the recommendation for anybody listening that wants to read a good book that on your
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:55.400]   site you give some good resources to the Flyer Talk forums and to some blogs that teach about
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.320]   this but it's definitely a good way to exploit the system a little bit right now.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:05.160]   It's great and it's going to be very important to us because like I said, once we get to
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.320]   these really cool places, it's going to be cheaper living there but getting there could
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:16.420]   be expensive but using these travel hacking techniques and currently I'm just building
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:21.360]   up my balances big time in preparation for all the travel that I plan to do in the next
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:25.200]   whatever decade or so.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:31.880]   Using those to make the travel between these interesting places very cheap is just going
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:38.120]   to make the benefit of travel even greater for us financially.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:44.000]   There are lots of great resources out there and it is very addictive and it's very important
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.200]   to know how to use your miles just as much as it's important to know how to get the miles
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   that you need.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.560]   I think using them is even more important because even though I flew from Boston to
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:02.440]   Dublin for such a little bit of money and not a lot of miles, the way I did it is very
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:07.320]   unknown, the way I used the miles and the way that I did.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.280]   I spent less than half the amount of miles that normal people do when they try to book
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:19.880]   America to Europe flight and I paid probably a third or a fourth of the taxes that some
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.480]   people have to pay.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:28.280]   So yeah, just following some good blogs and checking out Flyertalk and reading about it
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.600]   and you can really just extract some incredible amounts of value out of these things.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:38.840]   >> Trevor: I also want to point out how these functions stack, like how this is a part of
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.400]   the strategy.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:46.440]   Many people discount flying on points because of blackout dates, because of when they can
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.440]   fly.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:53.560]   Many people discount travel but if one is financially independent and one has flexibility
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:58.400]   over their schedule, then number one, you can fly either at the cheapest time, so you
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.560]   can take those Wednesday flights or the Saturday afternoon flights that are just simply inexpensive.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:09.440]   You can fly at the seasons when a lot of people can't fly, so you can avoid the summer season
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.480]   when everyone's out of school but you can go on the shoulder season between the high
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.360]   season and the low season and you can get really, really great values or you can pursue
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:24.200]   some of the, you can take the award tickets on the dates that they're available.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.920]   So you can be flexible on that and you can afford to slow down.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.920]   So like you said, one of the major expenses of traveling, when most people think about
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:37.600]   traveling they think about, "I've got this two week vacation that I have to take."
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.880]   You call it slow travel but if you have this two week vacation, let's say you're going
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:45.400]   to take a two week vacation to Europe, well let's say you pay retail and you got a thousand
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.760]   bucks each for a plane ticket and then because you're there for two weeks, you have to do
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.960]   this, you have to pack everything in every single day.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.920]   You've got to have rental cars while you're there.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.160]   You've got to stay in hotels while you're there.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.200]   You can't take a one month apartment rental instead of staying in a hotel.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.720]   You can't slow down enough to use public transportation instead of having your own car.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:13.440]   Because of the time pressure of being fixed on this work 50 weeks a year schedule, you
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:19.080]   wind up spending seven, eight thousand dollars on a two week vacation to Europe where if
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   you are financially independent and you can slow down, you can take that exact same amount
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.200]   of money and stretch it out over a couple of months just because of your flexibility.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.000]   So the functions stack on top of each other.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   >> Trevor: Oh absolutely.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.960]   You're not cooking for yourself.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:33.960]   You're not doing anything.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:39.160]   You're just spending money just as fast as you can pretty much just to have a good time
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.520]   and you will have a good time.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:46.720]   But as you said, seven or eight grand, that could easily sustain somebody for an amazing
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.840]   year in Central America or Southeast Asia or South America.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:57.760]   That could be a whole year of learning Spanish and learning how to cook and going to the
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:03.640]   local markets and things that make travel really special that just don't cost a lot
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   of money to do.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:12.520]   I know I could live for a year on some of the budgets people have on their one week,
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.520]   two week vacations here in the States.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.400]   >> Jon: It's interesting.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:23.040]   I think this is a US American concept that in our culture is not so well understood.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.360]   When I was in college, I lived in Costa Rica and I did a research project with a business
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.760]   school that I was studying at.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:33.920]   I did a research project for a Costa Rican eco-tourism company.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:42.520]   We prepared a report on American tourists, British tourists and German tourists.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:48.200]   It's very clear when you look at it that as Americans, we would go to Costa Rica for a
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:55.720]   one week vacation and we would want everything carefully programmed in that one week.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:59.680]   Every single day from morning to night, there are activities and we don't have a lot of
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:05.480]   time so we're willing to spend a significant amount of money on those trips.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.920]   We would want everything planned out in advance of the trip.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   When we go up, when we show up, we know what our itinerary is.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:16.560]   Every moment of every day is scheduled and we've got it all planned out.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.360]   The British tourists would come.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.200]   They would want their itinerary planned out but they would usually come for about a month
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   instead of a week.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.000]   They would stretch the time out longer and they wouldn't want everything planned out
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   every day.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.080]   They would want to make sure that they had some down time to figure it out.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.320]   I'm using generalizations to make my point but these are pretty accurate.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:42.960]   The German tourists would show up at the airport without a single plan, without a single booking
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.000]   but they would be there for two months.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   They would get to the country.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   They would get to Costa Rica.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.560]   Then once they were there, they would figure out what they wanted to do, when they wanted
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.560]   to do it.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.680]   They would spend half the money that the Americans spend in a week over a two-month vacation
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.680]   while they're there.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.680]   It's crazy.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.720]   It's a dramatic cultural difference between the cultures.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:07.160]   It's the adventure and the not knowing and the uncertainty that makes travel so rewarding
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.480]   when you look back on it.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:14.640]   My wife and I lived in China for three months and obviously didn't learn too much Mandarin
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.360]   in that time.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:22.760]   We would just hop on a local bus, try to find our way to some very remote, weird, small
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.480]   little village in China.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:32.680]   We wouldn't know exactly when the bus was coming back, if it was coming back.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   It's just fun.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.680]   It's the adventure.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.680]   That's what makes it.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:41.440]   If you want to have just normal life, eating the same things you eat and doing the same
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:46.760]   things you do at home, then save a lot of money and just go to the next town over.

[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.240]   and I always wondered, I could see myself doing this
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.720]   for quite a while, but I was like,
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.600]   wonder if I'll get tired of it.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.600]   And they've just loved it.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.180]   They always thought they'd settle down somewhere,
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.820]   but they just keep finding new places they want to go
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.040]   and traveling between them.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.920]   And like I said, they had half a million for both of 'em,
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.940]   and I think they have more now than when they started.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.920]   So it's very, very inspiring.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.820]   So yeah, I'll look forward to hearing them
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.460]   on your show as well.
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.560]   I gotta reach out to 'em first,
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.520]   but at some point I will.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.200]   So, all right, three strategies
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.600]   that you write articles about.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.960]   And I want to go over these strategies
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.040]   because I think they're valid things,
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.720]   but a lot of times people don't understand
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.620]   kind of how this can work.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.840]   Number one is you talk about traditional IRA
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.220]   versus Roth IRA.
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.440]   And at some point in the future,
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.440]   I'll do a show where I go through the details
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.660]   of the rules on each individual account
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.680]   as far as the traditional IRA and the Roth
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.240]   and all of the details of when you can take money out
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.360]   and the contributions and the advantages
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.040]   and disadvantages of most people.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.000]   I'm gonna summarize though, in a sense,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   most people are, if you read popular financial literature,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.120]   you'll generally find that most people will say
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.960]   that one should always choose to participate
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.380]   in a Roth IRA before participating in a traditional IRA.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.720]   And again, there are lots of reasons to this,
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.120]   but I want to talk about just the taxes.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.240]   So to explain for people, with a traditional IRA,
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.060]   you are able to make a contribution to that account
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.280]   prior to paying income taxes.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.160]   The money grows with no taxes assessed on it year by year.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.800]   And then upon distribution,
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.720]   the account is distributed without,
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.440]   excuse me, the account is distributed
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.120]   and that money is taxable income to you.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.520]   So you pay the tax on the backend.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.280]   The advantages to a traditional IRA
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.760]   is purely focusing on the tax,
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.480]   not focusing on any of the other aspects of it,
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.960]   which I'll cover in a future show,
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.760]   is that when you earn a dollar,
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.040]   instead of investing 80 cents of that dollar,
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.920]   because you pay 20 cents of tax,
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.000]   the full dollar goes into the account.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.680]   And the idea is that potentially in the future,
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.620]   some people feel that if the tax rates hold constant
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.200]   and if you have a lower income in retirement,
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.800]   that you'll be paying taxes at a lower rate.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.880]   The Roth IRA, if you earn a dollar,
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.800]   you go ahead and pay tax now,
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.320]   and then you invest the 80 cents,
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.800]   the money grows tax deferred,
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.760]   and when it comes out in retirement,
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.540]   the money comes out completely tax free.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.520]   Now there are other advantages and disadvantages
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.220]   between the two accounts.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:26.080]   Many people feel that the Roth IRA is a better approach.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.540]   And usually the reasons that they'll feel that way
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.440]   is either because of the flexibility,
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.200]   because of some of the distributions that you can take,
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.460]   the distributions that you can take now,
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:40.520]   or because of the, well, they run the numbers and say,
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.800]   well, I've got all this tax free money.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.280]   Most people don't realize that mathematically,
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.360]   if tax rates are constant,
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.840]   and if, so if income tax rates are constant,
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.760]   and if your income is constant,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.920]   and if your investments return the same amount,
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.360]   if they're invested identically,
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.560]   you'll have the exact same amount of money
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.620]   from a traditional IRA versus a Roth IRA.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.720]   So if you invest 10,000,
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.280]   well, let's use $5,000 into the traditional IRA,
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.560]   and you do a pre-tax, it grows a certain rate of return,
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.380]   and then you spend the tax dollars in retirement,
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.880]   versus the Roth IRA,
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.440]   you'll have the identical amount of money,
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.160]   they're mathematically identical.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.320]   So you're basically playing with two variables.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.020]   Number one, what income tax rates are,
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.200]   or number two, what your personal tax rate is.
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.240]   So you have a strategy, however, that is very unique,
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.800]   and will be appropriate for people to consider
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.720]   if you are looking forward to,
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.960]   if you're planning on lowering your income,
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.400]   your earned income at a very early age.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.440]   So walk us through your strategy,
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.200]   and why you say to start with a traditional IRA,
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.480]   and walk us through your strategy of how to do that,
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.480]   and how that works in an early retirement context.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.920]   - Sure, sure.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.280]   Yeah, this is one of the main reasons I started the blog.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.560]   I love the math behind all of this stuff,
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.960]   and I didn't see that there was,
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.960]   there's a lot of advice out there,
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.880]   but not a lot of it pertains to people
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.400]   that are pursuing early financial independence.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.960]   Most advice is geared towards people
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:13.000]   that are working to 65, and doing the standard thing.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.400]   So yeah, this is a chance for me to dive into the math
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.680]   from a financial independence perspective.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:24.280]   And yeah, before diving into it,
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.200]   I just wanna make the point that a lot of people
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.440]   focus on trying to eke out another 1%
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.200]   over the index, and they spend all their time
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.160]   picking stocks, and doing all this stuff
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:41.200]   that may help them, but in most cases it won't.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.440]   But then they ignore things like taxes,
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.760]   and fees, and transaction costs,
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.520]   and diversification, and things that are in their control
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.040]   they don't focus on, but then they try to make the money
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.240]   on things that they can't control.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.240]   So taxes are a huge deal, and if you can minimize them
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.080]   then you're gonna be able to meet your goals much sooner.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.200]   So I just wanted to get that out there
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.400]   before I dive into this.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.560]   So yeah, as you said, a lot of people
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.020]   do contribute to a Roth IRA.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:18.760]   Some people I've heard, 'cause they wanna diversify
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.160]   the types of accounts that they're contributing to.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.840]   So since a lot of people have a 401k,
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.360]   which is sort of like a traditional IRA,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.800]   and all the same attributes that you mentioned,
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.560]   they figure, well, I'll put some money into the Roth IRA,
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.500]   and then that way I have some tax-free withdrawals,
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.680]   and I have some taxable withdrawals, and things like that.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.920]   But yeah, for someone who is pursuing
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.360]   financial independence, we're in a very unique situation
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.240]   where we're probably not gonna make
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.060]   as much as we make right now.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.680]   I know for me, I will never make this much,
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.280]   because even if I get a job that pays this much,
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.720]   I'm not gonna work 100% of the year
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.320]   to get that wage, I'll maybe do 50%,
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.600]   or just work a quarter of the year, or whatever.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.040]   So I know that I'm not going to make as much as I do now.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.560]   So that already is one benefit
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.240]   of going traditional over Roth,
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.920]   because the tax that I'm paying now
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.960]   on my last dollar of income is a lot greater
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.140]   than the tax that I would be paying
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:25.040]   when I'm withdrawing from that account.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.080]   So that is already a benefit.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.700]   I personally like to take benefits
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.920]   that are available instantly.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.600]   So I would much rather have the tax break now
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.360]   and have more of my money working for me
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.580]   than put it in a Roth and then get
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:47.860]   that nice tax-free withdrawal later
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.720]   on a lesser amount of total money.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.700]   Because every dollar that I put in
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:57.300]   into a traditional IRA, I'm getting 100 cents of value
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.140]   to buy the shares.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.560]   So as I mentioned before, and as you just said,
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.580]   if it's a Roth, I'm actually only putting 80 cents
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.860]   worth of shares in the Roth,
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.940]   because I got taxed on the 20 cents
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:11.620]   before I could even buy the shares.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.860]   So that extra 20 cents worth of shares
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.580]   is just gonna compound and grow
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.340]   over the 30 plus years I have it in the account.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:24.020]   And that is going to far exceed, I think,
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:28.860]   any downside to having to get taxed on that income later.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:33.860]   But there are also very nice loopholes
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:38.680]   that not many people take advantage of,
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.260]   but only because they don't live the sort of lifestyle
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.500]   that I plan on living.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.860]   So there's a way to actually convert
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:52.040]   your traditional IRA and 401(k) into a Roth IRA.
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:58.100]   It's, you can, do you want me to go into that now,
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.780]   or do you want me to, are we gonna come back to that?
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.220]   Yeah, okay. - No, go ahead.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.260]   - So yeah, so just to give you an idea of my strategy,
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:06.820]   I actually can't contribute to a traditional IRA
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.100]   because of my income limits,
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:12.020]   but my 401(k) acts in a similar way.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.620]   So say, so I currently max out my 401(k),
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:20.140]   so that's 17,500 bucks a year that goes into my 401(k).
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.980]   So that's pre-tax money, so that means that's not taxed,
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.540]   so that lowers my taxable income by 17,500.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:31.460]   So already I'm saving thousands of dollars on tax
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.320]   that would have been taxed on that.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.140]   I then contribute that to my 401(k),
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.500]   and I will continue to max that out until I stop working.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.460]   So at the point I stop working,
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:46.580]   I can roll that 401(k) directly into a traditional IRA,
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:49.140]   'cause like I said, they're both similar types of accounts,
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.520]   and when you leave your job,
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.100]   you can roll that over into a traditional IRA.
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.460]   So once it's there,
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:00.620]   I can gradually convert that to a Roth IRA,
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:03.860]   and the way that works is,
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.440]   since you weren't taxed on the 401(k) or traditional IRA,
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.980]   you then have to pay tax
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.500]   when you convert a traditional to a Roth.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.280]   But if, as Joshua mentioned,
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.900]   my expenses are gonna be very low,
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.680]   my income's gonna be non-existent,
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.660]   so, well, besides the small amounts
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.520]   that I'm drawing down on getting some dividends
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.900]   and capital gains and things like that,
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.660]   but it's gonna be below the threshold
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.780]   that I'm even going to be taxed.
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:40.340]   So it's possible to, I think I worked out my numbers,
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.460]   it's possible for me,
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.000]   once I reach financial independence,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.340]   to transfer over $9,000 a year
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.520]   from my traditional IRA to my Roth IRA
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.220]   and not get taxed on a single penny of that transfer.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:59.720]   So then, since I have 30 years to transfer everything,
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.020]   by the time I reach standard retirement age of 59 1/2,
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:06.700]   I should have hopefully been able to convert
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.840]   my entire 401(k), my entire traditional IRA
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.480]   that I funded back when my income was lower,
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.240]   I should be able to transfer all of that money
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.560]   into a Roth IRA and not pay a single tax on the conversion,
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.620]   which would then result in all of that money
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.840]   being completely tax-free,
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.700]   because it's tax-free going in,
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.880]   it's been growing tax-free,
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.780]   and then it'll be in a Roth IRA when I withdraw it,
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:32.080]   so then it will be completely tax-free at withdrawal.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.680]   So that is a great way
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.200]   to have completely tax-free retirement money legally
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.480]   and not go to jail.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.840]   - Yeah, and this is a strategy,
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.640]   the only place that this strategy,
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.880]   like this strategy is an excellent strategy,
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.640]   the place that it works is if you're planning on,
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.080]   either if you're planning on having your income
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.880]   drop down to an extremely low level
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.800]   or if it happens for you by accident,
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.760]   maybe through a layoff,
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.480]   maybe through a medical condition, something like that.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.760]   So this could either happen by plan like you're doing
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.600]   or it could also happen for people
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:15.600]   who are, just it happens through circumstance.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.720]   But this is really valuable
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.340]   because the strategy that you're using,
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.920]   by taking your upfront deduction,
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.480]   you can generally get,
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.840]   this is all income-dependent,
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.600]   so again, this is not tax advice,
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.000]   you've gotta consult your own tax advisor
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.440]   who can walk you through the actual, for your situation.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.760]   But conceptually, if you can cut your income down
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.920]   through 401(k) and IRA contributions,
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.160]   that'll help you to get into a lower bracket.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.880]   It may help you to qualify for some more
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.960]   of the income-based either tax credits
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.580]   or deductions that are available to you.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.720]   And by paying very, very low taxes now,
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.200]   and then like you said, dropping your income out,
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.960]   you can then do the conversion into a Roth
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.960]   and by picking it up little by little,
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.960]   you can do this at a very, very low cost or nothing.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.440]   And in addition to it, by being at a low income level
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.680]   in, I don't know whether to call it retirement
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.120]   or financial independence under your plan,
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.480]   if you can keep underneath the brackets,
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.720]   if you can keep underneath the 15% bracket,
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.140]   you can conceivably get to a point
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.800]   where you pay $0 of income tax
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.400]   because you have a low amount of earned income.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.760]   Any dividends and taxable accounts would be taxed
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.280]   and capital gains could be at a 0% level.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.880]   And then also, with doing this strategy
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.640]   and by carefully regulating how much income you pick up,
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.200]   it can result in a very low tax bill.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.880]   But this is not something that,
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.080]   generally a CPA is gonna point out to somebody.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.120]   It's generally something that you need
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.340]   to understand at first and then ask your CPA
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.440]   or yourself if you run them yourself,
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.180]   how much income you can pick up.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.020]   I heard you say one thing.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.360]   Let me give you one quick interesting workaround, Brandon.
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.680]   You may or may not know, and obviously,
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.220]   I doubt you wanna disclose your income,
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.280]   but do you currently, so you said you currently
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.000]   participate in a 401(k) but you're not able
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.480]   to participate in an IRA because of the income limits?
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.080]   - I am able to participate in a Roth, not a traditional.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.720]   - Okay, so generally, you might wanna consider
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.160]   doing what you're doing as far as going ahead
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.860]   and participating in a Roth now.
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:22.040]   But for people who are beyond the Roth contribution limits,
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.560]   one interesting thing that has existed
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:29.120]   for the last couple years is anybody at any level of income
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.420]   can contribute to an IRA, period.
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.960]   It's just simply that you can't deduct those contributions
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.320]   on the front end if you're not,
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.200]   you can't deduct those contributions if you're not,
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.120]   if your income is underneath a certain amount.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.900]   So anybody, even if your income is,
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.480]   we'll call it half a million a year,
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.200]   you can, this is relatively unimportant
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.320]   at half a million dollars a year,
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:53.160]   but you can do what's called a non-deductible IRA,
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:56.020]   and then you can do a conversion into a Roth.
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:58.240]   So even though there are income limits for a Roth,
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.600]   if you're over those income limits,
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.480]   those income limits generally are, let me see,
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.400]   probably about, yeah, north of $180,000 basically,
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.280]   depending on what you're,
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.960]   whether you're married and all that stuff.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.080]   But if your income is over that,
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.800]   you can still pursue some of the strategy
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.080]   and get into a Roth that way.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.440]   Other kind of things I wanna touch on,
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.840]   'cause hopefully we're not making this too confusing,
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.400]   it's a little bit difficult to do in an audio format.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.240]   Even if you are pursuing early financial independence,
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.800]   it still is valuable to consider using these types
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.960]   of retirement accounts.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.680]   And by having the money in the Roth,
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.600]   there are too many people,
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.280]   the rules are generally with retirement accounts
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.360]   that you can't get the money out
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.280]   until you're at least 59 1/2 years old
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.160]   without paying penalties on it.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.480]   Well, there is a rule, once you have money in the Roth IRA,
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.840]   that after you've done the contribution
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.520]   and the money has been in there for at least five years,
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.080]   you can withdraw your basis in a Roth IRA,
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.960]   which is the amount of money that you've contributed
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.400]   and paid tax on, which under our example
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.780]   would be a low amount of money,
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:03.220]   but it's happening each year.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.600]   After five years, you can go ahead
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.080]   and withdraw those contributions
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.440]   and use them for current income,
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.880]   even if you're before the age of 59 1/2.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.320]   - Exactly, and that's a huge point.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.560]   And that's, 'cause I get a lot of questions,
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.760]   it's like, wow, you're putting so much money
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.260]   into your retirement accounts,
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.280]   but you can't get at it until you're 60, 59 1/2.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.520]   And it's like, how are you gonna fund
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.160]   the next 29 1/2 years of your life,
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.840]   28 1/2 years of your life?
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.400]   And it's like, exactly that strategy
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.000]   is what I plan on using.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.600]   And I've seen it referred to other places
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.920]   as a Roth IRA conversion ladder.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.480]   And you're exactly right.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.640]   So currently all that money is growing.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:49.640]   So those, say I only put in $5,000 into my 401(k)
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.800]   and I let it grow for 10 years
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.440]   and now it's $10,000 or something.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.960]   When I do the conversion,
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:01.280]   the whole 10,000 acts as my contribution.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.560]   So then I could potentially withdraw
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.920]   that entire amount after five years,
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.680]   which is a great, nice little side benefit
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.680]   of even taking your gains and accessing them beforehand.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.120]   So yeah, in my case, like I said,
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.640]   so assume that I am gonna,
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.640]   once as soon as I achieve financial independence,
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:27.640]   I'm gonna start converting $9,000, say, per year
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.640]   from my traditional IRA to my Roth IRA.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.800]   So that means after five years of doing that,
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.280]   then every year from then on out,
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.120]   if I continue doing that,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.200]   I'll be able to just withdraw $9,000 to live off
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.240]   of tax-free every single year from that account
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.360]   until I, well, until whenever,
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.880]   until my money runs out, really.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.800]   So yeah, so if you can come up with,
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.200]   as long as you have enough in your non-retirement accounts
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.400]   to fund five plus years of your lifestyle,
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.400]   then you can then sustain yourself potentially off the rest,
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.080]   paying little to no tax.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.080]   So yeah, sure, if I needed to live off of 15,000 a year,
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.480]   then I could transfer that amount every year
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.760]   and create my $15,000 Roth IRA ladder
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.400]   and pay a little bit of tax on it,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.040]   but I think I can, if I live on less of that,
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.480]   then it makes sense to convert less,
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.920]   and then that way I'm not paying any tax.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.920]   - Yeah, and there's some beautiful things to the Roth,
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:36.920]   is that because there's no,
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.920]   if you have a lot of money in a Roth IRA
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.280]   and you're past the ages where you can take it out,
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:47.400]   there's no, if you have a huge portfolio inside of a Roth,
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.320]   you can take out a huge amount of dividends per year
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.920]   and continue to have an effective tax rate of zero.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.520]   So if you have a lot of money in it, you can do that.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.680]   There's one other one that I wanna point out
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:00.640]   in addition to what you said
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.280]   that a lot of people simply aren't familiar with.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.280]   There's a rule called the 72T distribution.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.480]   So the IRS allows you one way
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.840]   to get money out of retirement accounts
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.640]   before the age of 59 1/2 without paying penalties,
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.160]   and it's if you do it under what's called
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.360]   a series of substantially equal payments.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.520]   Now, this is extremely dangerous for most people
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.280]   because most people aren't in a situation where they are,
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.560]   most people aren't in a situation where they have
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.420]   so much money that they can start taking money
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.840]   out of retirement accounts before 59 1/2.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.040]   But in the context of an early retirement strategy
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.600]   like you're pursuing, if you have the money in a Roth IRA
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.400]   and you've got that contribution done
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.520]   starting at really any age,
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.680]   if you take the money out under a table,
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:53.520]   an amortization table that is equal payments
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.920]   that are expected to last over your lifetime,
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.380]   then the money can come out before the 59 1/2 deadline
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:02.160]   without paying the penalty taxes,
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.760]   and in this case, without paying any taxes.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.440]   Now, the disadvantage, if you ever stop the money
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.360]   before 59 1/2, then you owe the penalty tax.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.140]   And so this has to continue for your lifetime.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:16.240]   But in the right situation for the right scenario
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.320]   for an early retiree looking to use these accounts
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.160]   for early tax savings and later tax savings,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.180]   if the rules continue as they are now,
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.880]   there are some ways of using the money.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.320]   - Absolutely, that's a great point as well.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.720]   And I'm not sure if I'm going to do that
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.720]   just because I'm hoping that maybe I won't even tap into
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.400]   that money and just let it grow tax-free,
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.540]   but yeah, that's an excellent way of knowing
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.800]   that you can get out that money
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.320]   without going through a Roth conversion ladder
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.840]   or anything like that, so that's an excellent point.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.320]   - Yeah, and you also want to choose carefully
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:55.200]   what assets you put into a Roth IRA.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.940]   So generally, if you're gonna have
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:00.640]   both capital gains assets and income assets,
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.720]   so capital gains assets, usually stocks,
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.760]   and income assets, such as bonds,
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.360]   you would usually want to put your income assets
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.400]   inside of your retirement account.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.880]   So you could have a scenario,
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.200]   by using some of the things that you're pointing out,
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.560]   you could have a scenario where you have
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.000]   a taxable brokerage account that holds your stock portfolio
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.200]   if you're gonna have an asset allocation
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.480]   that's gonna include both stocks and bonds.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.640]   You could use the brokerage account
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.560]   to hold your stock portfolio, which with your low income,
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.160]   if you can keep under that 15% income limit,
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.860]   which is kind of the numbers where you're at
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.280]   with your low income, you can effectively have
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.800]   a 0% capital gains rate and very favorable dividend rates.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.680]   And then with your income investments
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:49.120]   inside of the Roth IRA, that would allow you to use
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.840]   corporate bonds instead of municipal bonds,
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.600]   pick up a little bit of extra yield,
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:56.680]   and then you would be able to have that income
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.240]   coming out of your portfolio on a tax-free basis
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.440]   by using your Roth.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.860]   So there's a lot of little, not a little useful tools here,
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:05.980]   which maybe we'll cover in more detail in the future,
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.200]   but for the right scenario, your strategy
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.520]   to start with IRAs and 401ks,
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.680]   especially if they're deductible now,
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.960]   and then pursue the conversion strategy
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.700]   if your income is low in early retirement,
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:24.700]   then it's a powerful strategy.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.080]   - Yeah, and I just ran some numbers
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.400]   just to give people an idea, 'cause it's not,
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.960]   you're not eating ramen on this plan.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.520]   Like I said, assume you convert 9,000 a year,
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:39.960]   you can still live off of 30 plus thousand
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:42.160]   of dividends and long-term capital gains
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.920]   and still not be taxed on any part of that convert,
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.280]   that $9,000 conversion.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.460]   So we're still talking big numbers here.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.800]   Like you could have an amazing life
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.360]   living off of your 35, 30 grand worth
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.840]   of whatever your investments are returning
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.700]   and you're drawing down on them and dividends and things,
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:04.440]   and still do 9,000 every year,
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.800]   converting it into a Roth.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   So it's, yeah, the tax code does seem to favor
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:14.400]   early retirees, which is quite nice.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.820]   And the amount of money that you can actually save
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.920]   by implementing some of these strategies
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:23.340]   is so much more than you're gonna get
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:24.720]   if you try to beat the markets
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.180]   or try to find the star mutual fund manager
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.020]   and things like that.
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:32.960]   So your time is much better spent learning the tax code
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:37.960]   and learning some of these little tricks and loopholes
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:42.280]   and taking advantage of these types of accounts.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:46.100]   And you're gonna shed years and years off of your retirement
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:48.880]   and not get any more risk.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.960]   Whereas if you're just trying to pick stocks
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:55.600]   and beat the market, yeah, you may knock a few years off,
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.160]   but you may add a couple decades
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.920]   and your risk is much higher.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:03.540]   Yeah, we wanna use every one of these things.
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:06.420]   So, and by the way, obviously,
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.900]   anytime you're talking about financial stuff,
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:08.900]   it probably doesn't need to be said,
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.100]   but I'll say it anything.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.780]   This is all situation dependent.
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:13.780]   So hopefully people can just use these ideas
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.380]   and then look at your situation
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:17.340]   and consult somebody who's qualified
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:22.340]   and properly credentialed to give specific advice.
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:25.340]   But maybe some of these ideas would help each person
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:29.380]   to figure out their specific situation,
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.820]   'cause neither of us is probably qualified
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.860]   to give specific tax advice.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:36.020]   - Absolutely, yeah, that's always worth mentioning.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.500]   But yeah, at least you have something to go and talk about
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.400]   and ask about.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.940]   - Now, the next strategy of the three
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:47.660]   is you have what you call the ultimate retirement account.
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.960]   And this is a type of retirement account
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.700]   that most people don't have a clue about.
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:55.700]   So walk us through a summary of what you consider
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.580]   to be the ultimate retirement account and why.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:00.060]   - Okay, yeah, so as I said,
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.940]   I love taking advantage of tax advantages up front.
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:08.700]   I know this is gonna be probably the most I'm ever earning,
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.380]   so I want to lower my tax burden now
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:12.860]   as much as I possibly can,
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:15.060]   'cause then that means more of my money's working for me
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.780]   over a longer period of time.
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:20.740]   So yeah, the ultimate retirement account in my mind
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:23.820]   is the HSA, which is the Health Savings Account.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:27.500]   Now, this is an account that people can contribute
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.700]   to if they are currently enrolled
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:33.220]   in what's called a high deductible health plan.
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:37.340]   So if you aren't, then you won't be able
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.540]   to get the tax advantages of contributing
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:40.900]   to this type of account.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.980]   And the contribution limits are much lower
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:47.340]   than things like 401(k) and even IRAs.
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:50.000]   So you're not gonna get too much bang for your buck,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.540]   but it is definitely a good way
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:56.860]   to lower your taxable income
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.060]   and getting lots of the benefits
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:02.540]   of both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:06.580]   So to explain how this works
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:09.860]   and why it is so beneficial to contribute to,
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.980]   so the idea is that you can contribute,
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.500]   I think it's 32.50 in 2013,
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.060]   I think the contribution limit is.
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:21.740]   So you can contribute up to 32.50 a year,
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:25.260]   and that is pre-tax, so you're not taxed on that income.
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:28.100]   And you can then invest it,
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:33.780]   depending on the people that are holding your HSA,
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.740]   some have better investment options,
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:40.260]   others just have a savings account or equivalent.
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:45.220]   Mine, I can invest in broad-based, broad-index funds,
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:47.020]   stock market index funds, things like that,
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:48.320]   that have low expense ratios.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.900]   So I treat it just as another investment account.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:53.340]   So the idea is you can put this money in
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:57.340]   and then use that money for medical expenses
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:34:58.620]   without paying any tax on it.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:03.140]   So that means that if you spend 200 bucks at the doctor,
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:05.280]   that $200 is completely tax-free.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.940]   So already you're better off,
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:10.700]   because no doubt you're gonna have something,
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.420]   some medical expense in your life
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.460]   that you're gonna have to pay for,
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:16.860]   and it's much better to just pay for it with tax-free money
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.320]   than it is to pay for after-tax money.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:23.380]   So that's the main idea behind the account,
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:26.420]   is to allow you to pay for healthcare expenses
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:31.420]   with your own money and not pay any tax on that money.
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:36.700]   So my idea is, though, there's a little,
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:39.740]   it's not a loophole, I guess,
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:42.500]   but it's just part of the rules.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.020]   You don't have to take out that money
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.960]   as soon as you pay for the health expense.
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.200]   So for instance, say, like I said,
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.620]   I had a $200 doctor bill.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:58.120]   So yes, I could take that $200 out of my HSA,
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:01.040]   hand it to the doctor, and then that's it.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.620]   I just used tax-free money to pay for it, which is great.
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:09.700]   Alternatively, I could pay for that
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.880]   with $200 out of my wallet that's,
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.660]   you know, I've already been taxed on, it's just my cash,
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:18.680]   and then I can leave that $200 sitting in my HSA
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.000]   for the next 40 years to grow tax-free,
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.560]   and then I could take out that $200 tax-free.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.200]   So this is another way that I'm saving
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.940]   for my early retirement.
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:37.120]   So it's sort of acting to me like a combination
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.680]   of a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA,
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.080]   and an early retirement IRA,
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.600]   because every time I spend money on a doctor,
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.780]   I'll keep track of it.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:48.020]   That money will continue to grow tax-free,
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.340]   and then say when I'm 49, I'm like,
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:52.660]   oh man, I really need $200.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.220]   Then I can take that out tax-free
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:59.000]   and keep all of the investment earnings
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.980]   that have accumulated over those 19 years,
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:05.140]   and those will continue to grow.
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:06.120]   So it's like,
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:11.660]   so yeah, it's like I've been calling it the super IRA.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.920]   And the best thing is,
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:16.540]   so you may be saying, oh, well, that's great,
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:20.280]   but what if I don't have $3,200 worth of medical expenses
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.300]   before I turn 60 or something?
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.560]   The good news is that that account
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.000]   then just converts into a traditional IRA.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000]   So at that point, you could then do the conversion ladder
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.120]   that I already talked about,
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.280]   or you could just pay tax on the withdrawals
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.180]   just as you would a traditional IRA.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.740]   And at that case, at that point in your life,
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:47.100]   you may not have to pay any tax
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.540]   just based on how much income you are,
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.820]   you actually need to survive.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:55.500]   So yeah, at the worst case, it's just a traditional IRA.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.020]   At the best case, it's a super Roth
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.060]   where it's a traditional IRA
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:02.140]   'cause you don't pay tax going in.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.660]   It's like a Roth IRA 'cause you don't pay tax going out,
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.240]   and it grows tax-free,
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.100]   and you can withdraw some of the money
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:10.520]   prior to your standard retirement age,
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:12.600]   so you can use it in early retirement as well.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.160]   So that's, I hope that summarized it.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.700]   My post on it's probably a lot more eloquent, but.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:22.540]   - Yeah, this should give people just a teaser.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.460]   'Cause the HSA for early retirees is,
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:27.700]   and I've pointed people a couple times to your article
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.900]   'cause it does do a good job of kind of explaining it.
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:33.380]   Most people aren't so familiar with HSAs,
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.880]   and most people don't know about the fact
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.340]   that they can take the money out
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:42.020]   and spend it on any expense after the age of 65.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:45.180]   So now you're gonna go ahead and pay income taxes,
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:47.580]   ordinary income tax rates after that time,
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:50.060]   but that's identical to a traditional IRA,
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.920]   but most people aren't familiar with that.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.260]   And people oftentimes get these confused
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.860]   with flexible spending accounts, FSAs,
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:59.940]   which have to be spent each year,
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.980]   and they don't realize that the money
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:03.660]   can accumulate inside of the HSA.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.200]   My encouragement is this is a good way
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.760]   of stacking functions.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:11.960]   For early retirees, you're likely going to,
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:14.700]   legally now with the changes
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:16.720]   in US American healthcare law,
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.680]   you're gonna need to maintain some health insurance.
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.560]   And by the way, one caveat,
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.240]   it's a little unclear at the moment
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:26.660]   what with the implementation of the,
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.120]   what do you call it, Obamacare,
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.000]   Patient Protection Affordable Care Act,
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.400]   whatever it is, with changes in health insurance,
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.100]   the future of high-deductible health plans
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.340]   is a little bit uncertain,
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.980]   and then the future of health savings accounts
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:38.820]   is a little bit uncertain.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:41.180]   Doesn't seem like anything alarming,
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.940]   but keep it, if you're listening to this
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:44.320]   a year, two, three years from now,
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.300]   which is July of 2013, check the current rules,
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.900]   'cause this may have changed since then.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:52.420]   But the flexible spending accounts,
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:54.500]   people, you have to spend those each year,
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:55.680]   or you lose the money.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.100]   That doesn't occur with the health savings account.
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:39:59.260]   So the health savings account
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:00.460]   gives you an upfront deduction,
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:03.140]   and one way to add to your case
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.520]   for a super retirement account,
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.740]   unlike contributions to IRAs and Roth IRAs,
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.660]   my understanding is that health savings accounts
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:14.700]   are not subject to Medicare and Social Security taxes.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.540]   - Absolutely.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.320]   - So in a traditional IRA,
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.840]   although you don't pay current income taxes,
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.480]   your money, you still have to pay
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.820]   Medicare and Social Security taxes on the income.
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.700]   With a health savings account, you don't.
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:27.400]   So that's an extra savings.
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.520]   The money can accumulate.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.060]   Most people aren't familiar with how much,
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:36.060]   how liberal the definitions of what health expenses are.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.740]   So check the IRS website.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:41.360]   There is a, I'll put a link to it,
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.420]   I think it's publication 502,
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:47.360]   where you can check the IRS lists
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.960]   of what qualifies as an expense.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.260]   But even things like, the ones that always interest me
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.580]   is I wear contacts.
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:57.720]   Contacts and contact solution are qualified.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:58.900]   Some prescription drugs,
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:00.880]   it used to be that over-the-counter drugs were covered,
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.860]   that rule changed a few years ago.
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:05.340]   Even things that maybe traditional health insurance
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:06.580]   doesn't quite cover fully,
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:09.100]   things like chiropractic adjustments,
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:13.900]   other types of alternative medicine may be covered.
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.660]   Check the IRS rules.
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:17.340]   So there's a lot of flexibility to it.
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:20.200]   Plus, the fact that people are paying with your own dollars
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.820]   allows you sometimes with your healthcare provider
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:27.540]   to negotiate a discount, a cash payment discount
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:30.420]   that doesn't necessarily go through the insurance claim.
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:32.820]   And sometimes you get better deals because of that.
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.420]   So when you start stacking current expenses,
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:40.100]   current things, on top of your ideas
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:42.420]   about delaying the distribution
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.660]   and also taking it as retirement,
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.140]   it definitely bears looking into.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:48.140]   And it's one of those valuable places
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:50.020]   that people can stack their benefits
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:53.220]   if they're able to arrange their financial affairs
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.420]   in such a way that they can make the contributions.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.860]   - Yeah, and you made some great points about the FSA,
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:59.660]   because that, I actually just got an email
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:01.860]   from a reader recently, and he said,
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:05.780]   "I got this money, I'm about to dive into
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:07.100]   my health savings account,
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.420]   but I was reading the fine print,
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:10.780]   and it said that you need to use this
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.460]   before the end of the year, or else you'll lose it."
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.300]   And I hurried up and emailed him really quickly,
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.980]   and I was like, "No, no, that's an FSA,
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:17.420]   that's a flexible spending account,
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:20.740]   and you will lose it, so definitely do not
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.780]   put all your money in there
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:26.460]   if you don't think you're gonna spend it within a year."
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:27.800]   And then he wrote back, and he's like,
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.020]   "Yep, that was an FSA,
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.060]   and it looks like I don't have an HSA to contribute to,
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:35.540]   so that's very, very important,
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:37.340]   because yeah, you will lose the money
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:38.700]   out of a flexible spending account,
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:41.300]   so make sure you check that first."
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:46.300]   And your Medicare, that was also a great point,
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.020]   that'll save you another, what is it,
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.740]   7.5% or 7.65% or something,
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:54.940]   that you would have had to pay on that money,
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:58.200]   so that's definitely another excellent benefit.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.680]   - Yeah, and to your reader there,
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:04.480]   this is a suggestion to listeners,
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:08.180]   an HSA is generally, the HSA account
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.580]   is something that generally,
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:12.100]   most places you'll wanna set up yourself.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:14.580]   So your employer may offer you
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:18.260]   a high deductible health plan, which is HSA qualified.
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.060]   If that's the case, they may not,
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.500]   generally an employer doesn't say,
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:22.740]   "Here's who you have to use
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.180]   for your health savings account."
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:26.820]   You can go out and research and find a provider
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:29.000]   that will do it outside of that.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.340]   So if you have a health insurance plan
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.860]   that's a high deductible health plan,
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:36.480]   that's HSA qualified, you can still open the account.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.880]   It generally won't be something
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.240]   that is deducted off of your pay stub.
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.160]   So speak with your human resources department
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.000]   and ask about that.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.160]   Number two, for early retirees who don't have an employer,
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.400]   this is still possible with an individually owned
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.040]   high deductible health plan.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.520]   So as long as your plan is HSA qualified
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.240]   and your health insurance provider will let you know that,
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.040]   you can use an HSA bank or generally they're offered
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.880]   by banks or sometimes brokerage companies
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.940]   and you can research what would be the best provider.
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:09.600]   Then you can open this type of account on your own.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.360]   There are a lot of acronyms in health insurance,
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.320]   don't get them confused.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.480]   There's HSAs, which is health savings account,
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.560]   FSAs, which is flexible spending accounts,
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.120]   HRAs, which are health reimbursement accounts.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.120]   Each of them is unique and has their own advantages
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.240]   and disadvantages and their own implementation.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.240]   But hopefully this will give people
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.520]   a little bit of information to talk to their HR people
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.460]   or research further on their own.
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:37.400]   Anything else on the HSA, Brandon,
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.000]   before we go on to the last thing I wanna talk about?
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]   - No, no, I think that covers it.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.720]   And then yeah, those are all really good points
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.560]   that you made.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.760]   And yeah, as always, take a look
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:48.460]   and see if it'll work out for you.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:53.240]   But yeah, it could be very beneficial
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.600]   for people that are planning on early retirement
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:00.080]   and are just trying to minimize their taxes
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.960]   in the last few years that they're working.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:04.320]   - Absolutely.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.080]   Free Ivy League degree.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.560]   - Right, yep.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.760]   - Talk me through this, what are you doing?
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.620]   - Yeah, I'm currently one class and a thesis away
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.760]   from getting a master's degree.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:18.840]   This is something, you know, I--
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.320]   - What's your degree? - I'm sorry?
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.080]   - What's your degree gonna be in?
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:23.800]   - Yeah, so it's a complete 180
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.640]   from what my computer science bachelor's
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.360]   science degree was.
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.360]   So the, I have to say first,
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.460]   first I'm working full time,
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:36.760]   so there's only, at the institution that I work at,
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.720]   there's only a few programs that you can do part time,
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.540]   and this is one of them.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:44.320]   So I'm getting my master's of arts in liberal studies,
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.260]   but my thesis is actually gonna be on,
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:50.680]   I actually just was emailing my thesis advisor this morning
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.520]   about my proposal, but it should be something
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:57.440]   that would be interesting to both of our listeners.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.880]   So hopefully it'll result in some pretty cool research,
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.480]   but yeah, no, it's a master's of arts.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.560]   I've always thought I would go back to school.
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.120]   I've always wanted to try grad school,
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:13.080]   but there's no way I would want to pay for it
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.720]   because I currently don't need any other qualifications
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.280]   to reach financial independence,
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.880]   so there's no way I was gonna set myself back 50K
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.960]   just to go back to school for a bit.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:28.880]   But yeah, no, my wife and I moved to an area
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:33.200]   where there's an excellent university close by,
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.720]   and I decided, at the time I was working remotely
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.200]   for a financial company, and so yeah,
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:43.480]   once we moved close to the Ivy League school,
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.640]   I was like, well, let me look into it,
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.000]   see if there's any programs that
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.360]   I could complete for free as an employee.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.960]   So there was, and it sounded interesting
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.280]   and something that I hadn't done before
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.920]   'cause like I said, I was computer science,
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:03.720]   so I was just doing math and science and programming
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:06.480]   pretty much my entire undergraduate career,
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.440]   whereas this one's much different,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.280]   lots of reading and paper writing
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.160]   and discussions and things like that.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:14.880]   So yeah, I thought it'd be worth it,
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.000]   so I decided I was gonna go for it,
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.680]   and so I just kept an eye on the job boards for the school,
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:26.200]   and then as soon as one popped up that was what I do,
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.840]   I applied, got it, and yeah,
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.320]   I'm less than a year from graduation,
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:34.120]   which feels great 'cause it's been,
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.280]   doing it part-time is quite difficult,
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:41.920]   working full-time and then trying to do papers
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.120]   and read tons of books and all this sort of stuff,
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:48.200]   and since I'm doing it part-time it took over,
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.640]   I think it'll be just under three years
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.840]   that I'll complete it in,
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:53.640]   and I have less than a year left,
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:56.200]   so I feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel,
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.600]   and yeah, it's been great,
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.480]   and I highly recommend it for anyone
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.120]   that wants to go back to school.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:05.240]   I think that people could even get undergrad degrees
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.720]   by going this route.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.000]   I'm not sure on that, but I think that that's the case,
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.960]   but you could definitely get a graduate degree,
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:18.840]   and yeah, it's been very fulfilling.
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.400]   - Yeah, this can be,
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.120]   and the reason I wanted to talk about this
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.760]   is education is, many people's one of their major expenses,
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:30.320]   and people are very passionate about education.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.000]   Some people passionately believe
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.480]   that without formal education your future is doomed,
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:38.520]   and some people very passionately believe
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:41.000]   that if you go down the route of formal education
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.240]   your future is doomed,
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.240]   so there are a lot of strong feelings on it,
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:48.640]   but you and I don't know what's right for people,
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.440]   but if people are interested in formal education
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.480]   the approach that you're pursuing
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.640]   is one that can add a lot of benefits,
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:57.760]   and so I've thought a little bit about some different ways
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:00.400]   that you can leverage these,
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:03.240]   and again, this may just be a couple ideas in here
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.320]   for people to pursue on their own
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.720]   and see what's right for them.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:10.700]   Number one is that exactly like you said,
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:13.700]   many universities, if you're working for that university,
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.080]   will give you either discounted
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.280]   or completely free access to their classes.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:21.640]   Usually it's a cap of a certain number of classes,
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.720]   and I think that can be done at undergraduate levels,
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.720]   graduate degrees, and even masters and PhD type of work,
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.080]   and so the other thing is that by working at a university
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.080]   a lot of times the university
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:36.060]   may be a very enjoyable work environment,
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.800]   so rather than somebody working at a job
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.380]   that they don't like, that's very stressful,
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:42.920]   and then going out and taking on student loans
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.160]   to pay for a degree,
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.320]   it may be worth looking into working at a university
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.080]   and then using the discounted courses as a way to do that,
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:53.120]   and by lowering your taxable income,
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.000]   it's possible that you may be able
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.480]   to simply have a lower tax bill
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.000]   if you're earning a higher income
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.120]   and you go to a lower income,
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:02.680]   rather than having to pay for your income
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.320]   with taxable dollars,
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.380]   you're getting a valuable fringe benefit.
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:09.820]   A lot of times also universities
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:11.220]   offer generous benefit programs
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:12.780]   that go beyond their salaries,
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:17.660]   so universities sometimes offer very generous
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:20.060]   retirement programs with generous matches,
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:21.580]   generous health insurance,
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:24.940]   so if you look at the total value of a compensation package
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:28.860]   and include into it the dollars of your degree,
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:30.520]   that what you would be paying for the classes
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.420]   if you were paying for them out of pocket,
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:33.720]   it could be compelling.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.860]   - Those are all excellent, excellent points,
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:40.020]   and that was some of the things that I had to consider,
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.100]   'cause like I said,
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.900]   I was working for a big city financial company,
[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:44.960]   I was working remotely,
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.060]   so I had a lot of flexibility as far as that's concerned,
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:50.020]   and I was making good money,
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:55.020]   and it was a decrease to go and work for the university,
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.980]   but if you add up all the benefits,
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:00.700]   like the tons of paid time off,
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.880]   lots of holidays, great retirement benefits,
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.600]   and healthcare and things like that,
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.560]   and if you do add all those up,
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.760]   it is pretty similar to what I was actually earning
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:14.080]   as a pay-by-the-hour consultant,
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.560]   which is pretty impressive,
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:19.360]   and then when you factor in the educational benefits,
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.320]   then it totally blows it out of the water,
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:27.320]   'cause right now I think it costs
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.960]   over six grand per course,
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:32.640]   and I'm taking four courses per year,
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:35.080]   so that's another 24 grand of value
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:38.260]   that I'm extracting from being employed by the university,
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:41.020]   and as you said, it's much lower stress,
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:43.580]   it's just a totally different environment
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:45.200]   from corporate America,
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:49.440]   like it's much more rewarding as well,
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:52.680]   and I'm helping some of the smartest kids in the country
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:55.520]   get a degree rather than helping the bottom line
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.080]   of some financial company,
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:01.240]   and I actually enjoy my work a lot more,
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:04.780]   and yeah, it's great getting a salary,
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:06.960]   and going to school,
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:11.240]   and most of my classmates are paying 50 grand a year,
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:13.660]   and not getting paid, so.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.520]   - Yeah, and in addition, for early retirees,
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:19.960]   I think there's some other benefits.
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.880]   I'm familiar with some friends of mine
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.160]   who worked at a university,
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:28.600]   but also by being students and working at the university,
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:31.720]   had access to some university housing,
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.360]   and that housing is provided,
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.360]   they needed to pay for it,
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.280]   but it's provided at a discounted rate,
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.660]   or they can negotiate that
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:39.640]   as part of their compensation package,
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:42.440]   and so if you have university housing,
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.840]   that can help when people are looking
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.720]   to decrease their expenses substantially,
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:48.480]   'cause generally it would be less
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.120]   than maybe what you could find
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.120]   in the miles around the university.
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:55.060]   In addition, again, stacking functions,
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:58.080]   if you are living and working on a university campus
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.560]   where you're getting your education,
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.120]   it's probable that you can lower
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:02.360]   some of your other expenses,
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.380]   such as transportation expenses.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:08.160]   Many college students will ride a bike to class,
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:10.220]   and so now instead of having to ride a bike
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:12.080]   10 miles across town for a commute,
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:14.560]   you can simply walk to your job,
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:16.240]   that lowers your expenses.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:17.860]   Also, things like entertainment.
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:19.400]   In the university system,
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.440]   college students generally aren't the most affluent.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.520]   There's plenty of free and cheap entertainment
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.060]   that's really interesting
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.380]   that would allow people to live
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:30.800]   an extremely enjoyable but lower cost lifestyle,
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.860]   and people forget about this a lot of times,
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.480]   that it's not just something
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.620]   that you can only do at 20 years old.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.580]   Some friends of mine were doing it
[01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:41.360]   in their mid-30s with kids,
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.280]   and still able to live in,
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.400]   they weren't living in the dorms
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.560]   with the 18-year-old freshman students,
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:48.100]   but they were living in on-campus housing,
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:53.100]   working there, both spouses worked at the university,
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:56.380]   and it's a compelling situation financially
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:58.580]   if you can start to stack those functions.
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:00.280]   There's a way to get a degree
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.100]   and get an expensive education
[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:04.300]   without necessarily going the retail route.
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:07.620]   Just to go into details for a second,
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:10.360]   my friends who were,
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.660]   both spouses were working at the university,
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.940]   earning the income.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:16.260]   When you take on the fact that you have a couple of kids,
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.700]   you're living and working on a university campus
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:22.020]   where you have entertainment, low transportation costs,
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:23.780]   low housing expenses.
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.060]   When you take the kids,
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.660]   and you take relatively low income,
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.500]   but a lot of value for the income,
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.900]   and you start to run that through the tax code,
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:33.540]   you can qualify for the child deductions,
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:37.300]   you can qualify with a generous 401(k) or 403(b)
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.660]   as the case may be, retirement accounts,
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:43.220]   you can qualify for refundable earned income tax credits.
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.780]   I mean, it's a substantial, substantial financial gain
[01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:49.780]   for the right person in the right circumstances.
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.420]   - Absolutely, and you forgot one of the best things
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.060]   is the university library.
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:56.180]   There's just, you could just keep yourself entertained
[01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:59.180]   for decades with the amount of stuff that's in there.
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:02.140]   They got DVDs, CDs, they got tons of books,
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:04.260]   and yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:06.380]   There's a lot of fringe benefits
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:10.580]   of working for a university that could, yeah,
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.380]   make it very worthwhile for someone
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:14.340]   that's thinking about going back to school.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:18.020]   And yeah, just in case anybody questions anything,
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:22.180]   I use 401(k) synonymously with 403(b),
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:23.500]   but I actually have a 403(b)
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.340]   since it's a non-profit entity that I work for,
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:30.260]   but yeah, same type of thing, same account pretty much,
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:33.420]   but yeah, just in case some of your more,
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:36.900]   your listeners that are listening very closely,
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:38.300]   then I don't want anybody to think that,
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:41.380]   hey, how's he have a 401(k) if he works at a university?
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:42.820]   - That's true.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:45.020]   And then two other things, just to add onto that,
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.700]   two other ideas that I've had, and if you have any others,
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:49.020]   the nice thing about universities
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:52.860]   is many times the universities have programs of,
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:56.100]   either whether it's study or employment,
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.420]   where they're working together with other schools
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.820]   that are in other places in the country
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:01.340]   or other places in the world.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:04.740]   And so if somebody has an interest in world travel,
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:06.980]   it may be that by pursuing their education
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:09.460]   at a foreign university, when I was younger,
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:13.100]   I considered studying at University of Hong Kong
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:14.740]   'cause I was interested in living there.
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:16.900]   I didn't pursue it, but it could be that
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:19.420]   by being a student in an international context,
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.740]   you can take some of those things
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:22.940]   that you talked about earlier with travel,
[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.660]   you can combine it with earning an income
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:26.780]   and combine it with educational value,
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:28.580]   and now you've stacked so many functions
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:29.660]   on top of each other that you've got
[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:32.780]   a really powerful, really powerful scenario.
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:35.620]   - Absolutely, yeah, studying abroad in Glasgow
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:39.660]   was one of the, yeah, the best years of my life.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.180]   And I met my wife over there
[01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:43.300]   and completely changed my outlook on everything.
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:46.180]   So yeah, that could be a very fun
[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:49.140]   and rewarding thing to do.
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:52.180]   - Yeah, and then the last one,
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:54.960]   and then we'll wrap up, is that just to remind people
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.740]   that a lot of times, this isn't necessarily
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:59.460]   just limited to university level.
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.560]   Many times, if somebody's looking for a way,
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:04.220]   whether it's private school, many private schools
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:07.140]   for elementary and high school students
[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:09.620]   offer similar programs, and it could be
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:13.280]   that if somebody, something that my parents were able to do,
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:16.300]   or that my parents did that allowed me
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:18.580]   and some of my siblings to attend a private school,
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.300]   it could be that instead of two parents working
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:24.200]   at higher income jobs, it could be that
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:27.620]   with one of the parents switching to working
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:30.960]   at either a university so that their children
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.540]   could go through college, or whether it's,
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:35.260]   'cause this is also a strategy for kids,
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:36.460]   that if you have children that you need
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:38.420]   to put through university, the same type of program
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:41.300]   can apply to parents and their children's students.
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:44.620]   Or at high schools, you can get a significant discount
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:48.340]   up to 100% on tuition, and if that lowers your,
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:49.700]   again, if that lowers your tax bill,
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:51.380]   because you have a lower earned income,
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:55.660]   if that allows for you to pursue some
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:58.060]   of these other strategies that we're talking about,
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:00.060]   consider it, and consider if some of these strategies
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:04.180]   might help you to achieve your financial goals sooner.
[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:06.300]   - Definitely, great advice.
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:07.140]   - Brandon, what did we miss?
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:08.340]   Anything else you wanna add?
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:09.580]   That's about it as far as what I had
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:10.900]   on my list of things to talk about.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:12.500]   Anything that we missed, or any--
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:15.460]   - No, that was great, I really, really enjoyed it.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:18.100]   Yeah, that was, like I said, I was looking forward
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:19.380]   to being on the other side of it,
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:23.060]   and it was a lot easier, so you did a fantastic job,
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:26.820]   and I had a great time, so I appreciate you letting me
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:29.540]   come on and talk about some of this stuff.
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:32.860]   - Yeah, well, keep it up, and I like to encourage people
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:35.980]   to sign up and read your blog and listen to your podcast.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:38.260]   Things that's interesting that I like is that
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:41.860]   you're not there, you haven't achieved it, right?
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:44.100]   So you're not technically financially independent yet.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:45.420]   - That's correct, yep.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.460]   - You're working down the path, and a lot of times,
[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:50.460]   if people are interested in goals similar to yours,
[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:53.980]   you're gonna develop a community around your site
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:55.420]   and around your blog and podcast
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:57.820]   of people that are pursuing similar goals,
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:58:59.260]   and that can be really encouraging,
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:01.540]   is for those who are interested in those types of goals,
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:04.780]   to talk with one another, to encourage one another,
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:08.740]   to brainstorm ideas, and it's also fun sometimes
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.740]   to see people working towards their goals
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:12.540]   and just simply follow them on the path.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.700]   I can guarantee, probably with a pretty,
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.020]   I feel pretty confident that your plans
[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:18.300]   and your ideas are gonna change,
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.820]   and you're gonna find out that some of the stuff
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:21.460]   that you've probably even said in this podcast
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:23.540]   doesn't work for you three years from now,
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:25.980]   but you're gonna find some new stuff that does work for you,
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:27.580]   and that's okay.
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:29.260]   You're probably more likely, you're more likely
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:30.540]   to achieve your goals 'cause you're working
[01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:33.740]   towards something rather than just simply floating on by.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:35.260]   - Absolutely.
[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:37.540]   - Keep up the good work on your blog and on your show,
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:40.060]   and I promise I'm not following you around
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:40.900]   interviewing all of your guests.
[01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:42.100]   - Yeah, that's all right.
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:43.620]   Like I said, I picked them for a reason
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:46.100]   'cause I really like reading their stuff
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:47.320]   and wanted to hear more from 'em,
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:51.380]   so even if you take 'em all, I'll still be listening
[01:59:51.380 --> 01:59:54.580]   'cause like I said, I'll like to hear anything else
[01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:55.740]   that they have to say about it,
[01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:57.760]   and you'll probably ask different questions than I did,
[01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:01.180]   so yeah, feel free to go for it.
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:02.020]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:04.060]   I'm trying to get, when it's available,
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.260]   I'm trying to get Jim Collins from GL Collins NH on here
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:08.220]   'cause I want to talk about,
[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.900]   I love some of his writings on real estate,
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:12.020]   and I think he has a good way of talking through that
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:13.300]   in some of his articles he's written,
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:15.740]   so I'm hoping to get him on here to talk about that.
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:18.660]   - Oh yeah, yeah, I'm actually planning on just having
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:22.240]   a call with him right after this, not a podcast or anything,
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.340]   so I'll put in a good word, and I'm sure he'll be on your
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:27.800]   show in no time, but I know he's busy over the next
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.180]   few months traveling and Ecuador and stuff,
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:35.320]   but yeah, now I'm actually, I sometimes help him
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:38.020]   with some of the more technical stuff of his blog,
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:43.020]   the computer side of it, so I'm gonna call him
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.620]   right after I finish speaking to you,
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:47.980]   and no doubt look into something computer related,
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:50.900]   so I'll be sure to mention that I had a good time.
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:51.940]   - Awesome.
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:53.300]   Well, that has been another episode
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:55.220]   of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:57.060]   Today talking with Brandon, the mad scientist.
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:58.980]   All the links to these articles that we've referenced
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:00.340]   will be in the show notes, and I'll put links
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:03.540]   to your podcast on iTunes and to your website.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:06.520]   Encourage people to get over and enjoy some of your content.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:09.080]   If you have questions or anything that you'd like
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:10.320]   to talk with Brandon again in the future,
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.480]   put notes in the comments section, and who knows,
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.680]   maybe we'll have him back in a year or two
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:15.800]   and see how he's doing on his journey.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:16.640]   So thanks again, Brandon.
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:18.800]   - Hey, my pleasure, Joshua, take care.
