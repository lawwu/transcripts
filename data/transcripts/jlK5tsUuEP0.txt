[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   just a couple questions before we kick off okay look that's what i told you before it's bad
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.240]   o'clock okay it's thick 30. i've been through a lot sax right now but i'm still flirty okay
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.400]   is everybody back up in the building sax it's been a minute tell me how you're healing
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   because i'm about to get into my feelings how you feeling sax how you feel right now
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.560]   what language are you speaking right now
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.680]   you're right remember when you had at your 50th oh yeah when you had and she sang
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:43.840]   and she sang and your was dancing to beep delete that delete that let's start executing
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.560]   the insta strike with jake why insta strike when he says something that we just insta strikes we
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.800]   don't have to edit it later just insta strike it's because um i am uh taking back my power i was in
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.120]   therapy
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.560]   the other day and they told me i need to take back my power insta strike but he apparently
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.800]   reads the comments section because he knew friedberg that you won the episode last week
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.680]   oh big time which i agree with i thought you did i agree too it was big friedberg energy
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.880]   finally i honestly do not like the competitive nature of the show i think it makes us all hate
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.280]   each other and it's not a good dynamic we should just do the show with each other
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.640]   i know but the point is your performance after i threatened to fire off the show has gone up
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.720]   you know who also doesn't like the competitive nature jacob because
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.080]   he's losing yeah totally the fact that i'm even still here is winning i love how jacob thinks he
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.400]   can threaten to fire freeburg it's like the janitor at staples center think he's gonna fire
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.920]   lebron because he played poorly in a game this is a motivational technique i got the best out of him
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.480]   i'm like michael jordan he's my dennis rodney you're like the hot dog dealer okay pal he's
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.680]   like lebron james you're the hot dog i do not insta strike these comments
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.000]   don't let your winners ride
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   all right everybody uh welcome to the all in pod uh with us again uh david freeburg took a break
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.440]   from playing his stray video cat game uh sax is here in his deposition apparently
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.960]   chamomile do you guys want to see this look at this
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.240]   size of this jcal's apparently playing no comment today on the comments so i will open the show i
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.920]   will open the show by asking david sacks would you like to tell us about what you're holding in your
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.960]   hand yeah okay so i got this subpoena from twitter this is a non-party subpoena for didn't twitter
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.320]   subpoena your tweets yes let me get into that this is subpoena i thought they're public they are
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   these nitwits have walked out lifted and billing them with probably two thousand and twenty-five dollars.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.920]   thousand dollars an hour to subpoena tweets that are public i mean brilliant brilliant strategy
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   but this is called a subpoena for production of business records in an action pending outside
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.960]   california so i'm not a party to the laws at least they're not suing me because i have no
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.680]   involvement in this thing but they sent me the broadest ever subpoena it's like 30 pages of
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.840]   requests and now i gotta hire a lawyer to go quash this thing because they basically want any of my
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.040]   communications with any of my friends over the last six months and they're like i'm gonna go to the
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.760]   court in the next two months it's insane sax can you just explain to the audience and to us like is
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.320]   this is a court sanctioned subpoena the court is basically allowing the lawyers to demand that you
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.520]   hand over these communications is that right yeah but i haven't had a chance to fight it yet so now
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.800]   at my own expense i gotta hire a lawyer and go send them to fight it because this is a ridiculous
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.960]   overbroad subpoena and by the way i'm not even involved in this thing i'm just a commenter on
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.640]   twitter um i don't have any let me just save
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.160]   walk tell lipton a lot of time right now i'm not in possession of non-public information about this
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.120]   and you know the craziest thing is yeah like you mentioned they cite my tweets as a as an exhibit
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.240]   here and they say they want all documents and communications concerning your statement in a tweet
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   dated april 16th that the quote new twitter ceo checklist includes eliminate all bots and fire
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.480]   useless employees 50 percent of the time they're not going to be able to get the job done and they're
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.980]   going to be able to get the job done and they're going to be able to get the job done and they're
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.520]   going to be able to get the job done and they're not going to be able to get the job done and they're
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.920]   going to be able to get the job done and they're not going to be able to get the job done and they're
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.520]   so obviously they didn't like that uh your statement in a tweet dated april 25th crazy
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.800]   thought what if jack masterminded this whole thing your statement in a tweet dated july 18th
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.920]   that quote randomly sampling 100 accounts a day is not a serious effort uh and or your statements
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.200]   in any other tweet concerning the merger blah blah let me just save them time right now i don't have
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.600]   documents and communications concerning my tweets now i know to a lawyer at walktel lipton that
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.560]   looking at my tweets and how brilliant they are you may think that i have extensive documentation
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.360]   and source material for them but let me tell you what happened i went to go take a and
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.880]   i basically tweeted off the cuff and that's how that tweet ended up in the public record there
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.320]   are no documents and communications concerning my tweets and this idea that somehow i guess what
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.040]   they're trying to get at is that they're not going to get the job done and they're not going to get
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.120]   a job done and they're not going to get the job done and they're not going to get the job done and
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.680]   is that somehow i was tweeting on behalf of someone or at someone's behest not true go look
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.240]   well before this year at my public tweets and blogs about the topic of free speech i've been
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.200]   a critic of twitter's for a long time on the issue of free speech i've written a um a content
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.760]   moderation policy i've written about what i think a content moderation policy for a social network
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.880]   that cares about free speech should be you know i've written all these posts on medium going back
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.760]   years now you know i was a critic of twitter throwing donald trump off the platform so these
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.240]   views that i've publicly stated are the reason i've stated them is they're just my views and
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.000]   there's just nothing more nefarious or something behind them other than that and they're just i
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.200]   think they're just trying to chase a there that's there is no there there right so let me just say
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.240]   everyone a lot of time you and i can talk because our our friends have no comment on this matter
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.480]   yeah one question i have a follow-up question during this movement that you had and you composed
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.560]   the tweet is there any documentation of the movement no but uh you know next time that i
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.480]   compose a tweet on the can i will document it thoroughly and i will send the lawyers that
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.120]   walked out lipton what happens if you don't respond in 20 days i don't know i mean i gotta
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.800]   i mean now i've hired a lawyer but by the way just so people understand you may think that
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.120]   because of my position in business or something that these things happen all the time they don't
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.320]   i've been maybe subpoenaed like three times in my entire career and the and i've never been
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.760]   subpoenaed in my capacity as an individual it's always been in connection with a company and i
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.400]   don't think i've gotten one of these in over five years so this just does not happen that often
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.600]   these guys are totally chasing at straws and it leads me to believe they're they're wasting my
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.840]   time and twitter's money and they're trying to somebody at twitter should just rein in
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.240]   their lawyers because they're i'm sure racking up a fortune in legal fees it sounds like
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.160]   um sax the case is that they're trying to make that elon used his network of friends
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   to help wash away the deal because he didn't like the price anymore and had his friends you know kind
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.520]   of tweet about bots and other stuff to support his case for killing the deal because he didn't like
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.120]   the price and they're trying to see if there's any communications that he specifically said he
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.840]   didn't like the price yeah i mean look they all in addition to my tweets they want all my documents
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.560]   and correspondence related to my appearance on megan kelly my appearance on the will kane podcast
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.000]   and you know other media appearances i've done look you know i had no coordination with you
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.560]   elon before appearing on any of those shows i just went on those shows and said what i think i mean
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.720]   look it's not like i'm a guy who doesn't have hot takes every single week on various issues you know
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.800]   we do that we've been doing this podcast for years i've been tweeting for years i'm just a commentator
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.000]   on this i have i've never been in possession of non-public information and i've tweeted my takes
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.440]   based on the public information that's been available about this dispute now you know after i
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   heard for example on will kane i remember elon tweeted in support of my appearance but there was
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.720]   no coordination before i appeared or after for that matter he just liked the appearance yeah so
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.400]   it's just me spouting off doing what i've been doing on this pod and tweeting for years now i can
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.640]   understand if maybe they're trying to read something into it they're on a fishing expedition
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.040]   but i've just told you i just think the truth is the whole thing is just such an enormous waste of
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.200]   time just get into court adjudicate the thing and move on
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.800]   i was reading um yesterday this guy who follows the delaware courts pretty closely he had a bunch
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.080]   of commentary and it he mimicked some of the stuff or the judge apparently on the case said some
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.440]   stuff about preserving the integrity of the court meaning that the interpretation people are making
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   is that ultimately they don't want to the court is unlikely to try and force the merger because if
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.040]   the merger then doesn't get consummated it damages the reputation of the court's ability uh to make
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.560]   it happen and then it's just a matter of time before it gets done i just think that's the way it is
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.000]   and i think it's a very important point i think i think it's a very important point and i think it's
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.920]   important for the court to make a decision about what they want to do it's not a matter of time
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.280]   because it's a matter of time before it gets done i think the court is a very important point and i
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.640]   think it's important for the court to make a decision about what they want to do and it's not
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.960]   about the court's ability to make a decision about what they want to do it's not about the court's
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.920]   ability to make a decision about what they want to do it's not about the court's ability to make a
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.000]   decision about what they want to do it's not about the court's ability to make a decision about what
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.800]   they want to do it's not about the court's ability to make a decision about what they want to do it's not
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.500]   anything to deserve it or prompt this I wasn't part of the transaction I just wasn't um and I've
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.720]   never I've never and I've never said anything in regards to the transaction that should lead
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.700]   anyone to believe that I'm in possession of non-public information yeah so this is harassment
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.620]   as punitive and the fact that they're citing my tweets in which I criticize Twitter's management
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:10.500]   it's just petty and vindictive yeah I agree I mean look at your legalIs reimbursed probably good luck
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:18.240]   no five or six years ago I approached Twitter about what I would have called a friendly activist
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:27.120]   myself in a and another large fund and the reality is there's a lot of data that sits uh in the
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:33.600]   public domain that you can use to get a very clear view of Twitter's advantages and disadvantages
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.200]   and so you know all of these issues that Twitter is dealing with has been known for a long time
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.740]   to people that spent any time analyzing the stock comparing it to other social media stocks so I just
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:54.300]   don't understand what all of this is about at the end of the day a person that had a point of view
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:00.120]   has changed their mind get to the bottom of what that person thinks but going on these
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.340]   broad fishing Expedition I think is just really stupid and then what was Joe Lonsdale subpoenaed
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.900]   for I mean he just appeared for being at the all-in Summit for being a guest at the all-in
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:16.080]   Summit so so that that just shows you how silly this is too because Elon we did an interview the
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.200]   four of us interviewed Elon at the all-in Summit uh in Miami back in was it May is when did we do
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.280]   that yeah in any event um so Elon appeared but he dialed in by Zoom it's not like he was walking
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.240]   around the hallways bumping into people and talking like there was he did not communicate
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.180]   with anybody else at the Summit yeah he was a guest by Zoom so if you want to know the
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.120]   communications that we had just go watch that public recording of us interviewing Elon there's
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.880]   just again this there's no need for this fishing Expedition guys this is the this is the record
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.460]   for the longest amount of time in his life J Cal has not spoken so I want to I want to
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:03.420]   acknowledge this moment and we can move forward um Saks did you do any prep work for the interview
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.940]   with Elon while you were wow good question in the commode no in the commode there's no prep work I
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.300]   showed up
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:17.160]   um barely I barely showed up barely you guys remember yeah oh my gosh see and you guys don't
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.740]   want to do all in Summit 2022 come on 23 come on we're good we're good yeah exactly why do I need
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:29.160]   another one of these I actually want to have Friedberg stands create an event honoring him
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.720]   and I'm going to appear there as the keynote speaker absolutely Sultan of science Con actually
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.400]   I should really thank you J Cal yeah it's totally for throwing the Summit thanks Jake
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.760]   first I blame Twitter's executives then I blame you I think you could put listen if we do another
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:51.180]   all in Summit maybe it's profitable and can we just say legal bills can I just say like as a
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:59.520]   user just as a user okay commentary the the bot issue is really real like how many accounts are
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.000]   there which have like 20 or 30 followers that just spew vitriol either positive or negative
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.700]   constantly every time you tweet anything it makes
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:15.000]   tweeting impossible I used to be an ardent user of Twitter and I think in the last year it has
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.960]   become exceptionally unusable well and so they should just fix they should fix that product
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.120]   quality problem in fairness to Saks he did pay ten dollars per account to have those created
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.920]   and to control your replies but it is true if you I always screenshot it I look at who's like
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.400]   trolling me in replies and inevitably it is uh a six month old account with that's following
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:45.480]   100 people and has no followers or five followers and has like some you know large but I mean it's
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.440]   like it's like numbers at the end of the name every time you say something every time I say
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.480]   something it's like every other comment is about a stock it's about a crypto thing that they want
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.280]   you to click on and so you know this last month I've started to experiment with turning comments
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.580]   off and it's been the best because I can still communicate out it gets the same reach millions
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.100]   of people will see what I have to say but I don't have to deal
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:17.340]   with all of the bullshit that comes with it now yeah but you can also pick you should there's a
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:23.460]   real problem on that platform that needs to get fixed here's the thing it's easily fixable
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:29.700]   because if you go to LinkedIn or Facebook or Instagram you don't see this so if it if the
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.940]   other platforms can figure it out across many different companies it's not like
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.800]   there's some secret sauce here you just have to put up you know a couple of reasonable Gates
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.840]   and have some reasonable reporting and you take a little friction out and people will not be able
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.060]   to create bots on mass yeah I noticed that problem you know in the early days of the Ukraine war when
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:53.340]   I would tweet out my opinion my non con my contrarian opinions my non-consensus opinions
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.520]   on the Ukraine war you get attacked I saw I remember you were getting attacked it was
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.860]   ruthless and those are not real people those are not real people those are algorithms yeah when
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:07.500]   you would go click on those accounts you would see that they were accounts created that month with zero followers
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:14.760]   zero following and uh they're brand new accounts without any history and they were all tweeting the
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.560]   same thing accusing me of being Neville Chamberlain it was all just you know Putin talking points or
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.360]   whatever so there you know I think particularly when you speak out against the current thing
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:30.420]   there's yeah you know an organized effort to try and drown you out and but look the Washington Post
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.040]   had a story about this that Ukraine was really good at what they called strategic communications
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.060]   propaganda but in any event yeah I mean look there's absolutely a problem it's now a playbook
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:48.300]   um if you I don't know if you guys saw the Zack Snyder uh recut of Justice League supposedly there
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.460]   were bot armies that put the pressure on Warner Brothers to release his cut of that movie
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:59.640]   and that he might have in some way been involved was the insinuation and it actually drove Commerce
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.200]   they gave him the whatever 30 40 million dollars to recut the film uh all right let's talk about
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.900]   markets since that's what everybody um really comes here for
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:14.040]   uh looks like inflation is uh finally maybe uh getting a little pushback gas and oil is way down
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.300]   a big win for Americans and obviously the administration there clearly is an upper
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.380]   bound to how much people will pay for a gallon of gasoline consumption is actually going down which
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:29.460]   is interesting humans pretty adaptable there uh jobs and we've talked about this every month as we
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:35.400]   watch it uh finally dipped under 11 million as sacks predicted you know we're gonna shed 300
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.600]   400 000 jobs
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.120]   uh it seems every month uh which should take this uh you know 10 11 million number over the next year
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.180]   down to maybe five or six which would still be uh an unbelievable number still put us up very robust
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:54.780]   full employment which has been a big question so there's a number of of open job the the number of
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.800]   job wrecks it went down by something like half a million in one month yeah and it's been going down
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.540]   three or four hundred so it's it's kind of been pretty consistent but there's clearly something
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.300]   going on here and
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:12.840]   um the stock market interestingly um we've started to see a little bump here even crypto
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:21.000]   um which the most speculative of all assets I guess Bitcoin bounced as well you know hitting 22 23 now so
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.760]   what do you think Chamath about markets we you you may have called the bottom uh here on the program
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.400]   a couple of months ago and uh I started J trading three weeks ago based on our discussions here thinking
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.680]   that we're bouncing along the bottom is it a head fake right now I think at the time initially I
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:48.960]   think I said you know it rallies to around 4 000. I was a little off rally what rallies to 4 000.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:59.220]   the S P yeah probably gets to 4 200 4 300. look it's always important from my perspective
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.540]   today just so people know yeah it's always important from my perspective to just take the
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.740]   other side and just
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:11.100]   intellectually debate with oneself why the other side could be right so in at this point right now
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.620]   what people would say is okay the Fed's going to capitulate at the beginning part of 2023
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.760]   we have a pretty clear forecast for all the rate increases that have to happen
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:27.180]   everybody's doing the work that's necessary either raising prices cutting costs or doing
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:34.620]   both letting people go Etc Etc so maybe we're we're there okay so what's the other side of that
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:43.140]   well I think again as I've stated before the other side starts with energy and the reason why I
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.780]   think it's important is that it really is the conflation of an economic system and a political
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:54.960]   system using an instrument and if you look inside of what's happening in Europe there's a lot of
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.020]   complexities here that I think need to get unpacked so for example a couple days ago the
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.920]   French government basically said that they're going to start producing less nuclear energy
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.860]   and you'd say well why would they do that well it turns out because you know the temperatures
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:17.940]   are so high you cannot use the water to cool these nuclear reactors because the the exiting
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:23.100]   water is then so hot that would actually destroy the ecosystem of the lakes and rivers that they
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:30.360]   use to feed natural fresh water in to cool the nuclear reactor second because it's so hot
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:37.560]   that all the rivers are below their natural level barges that carry coal and that gas are getting
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:43.980]   stuck on the Danube the Po which is the longest River in Italy that feeds all the fields actually
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.140]   can't is below the level where it can actually off you know offload the water so farmers can't
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:54.300]   basically do what they need to do to produce a food supply so if you play all of that out
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.700]   you start to see an issue where by you know
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.160]   October November of this year we're back into the same complexity where energy is the tip of
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.380]   the spear around which everybody starts to debate all of the national security issues that we have
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:17.280]   to deal with the Ukraine war Etc Etc so I don't know I mean you know you've made a lot of money
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.080]   this year by basically doing the following which is the exact opposite of everybody else when
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.720]   everybody else was freaking out had you bought you would have made a ton of money now everybody's like
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.040]   it's over and you can tell that by looking at the numbers and the numbers and the numbers and the
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.900]   you can tell that by looking at the VIX which is the volatility index we're about to get into the
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:42.720]   high teens you have systematically it has been true that when the VIX is in the teens you tend
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.540]   to basically buy volatility which is essentially you get short stocks and when the VIX is in the
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.460]   30s you tend to basically sell volatility and you buy equities because we've hit the bottom if you've
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.840]   been doing that for the last year you've made a ton of money so there you have it I really don't
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.380]   know what's going to happen from here but I'm going to give you a little bit of time to think about that and then we'll talk about it in a minute.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:02.880]   happen from here but I tend to think things still have to get a lot worse to flush everything through
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.840]   the system and for people who don't know the VIX is the ticker symbol that you can look up yourself
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:13.800]   for the CBOE's volatility index which measures the stock market's expectation of volatility
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:23.640]   based on the S&P index's options trading if you look at oil sacks we are now down to 87 bucks for
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.720]   a barrel haven't been here since uh gosh looks like a lot of people are going to be buying stocks
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:37.140]   looks like yeah February maybe and so and gas prices plummeting something going well in this
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:43.260]   regard what are your thoughts yeah I mean it's uh that particular Commodity is coming down I
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.940]   still think we have a big inflation problem um why do you think it's going down I guess production
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.920]   stepping up I mean in response to higher prices uh people increase production and um the price
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.320]   comes down no no no no no there's less demand the the the crazy sad thing about this whole thing with
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.060]   Biden was that OPEC came back and they basically said we can increase like 600 000 barrels a day
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:09.060]   but the only two countries that are able to do it were I think Kuwait and Saudi and the total number
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.080]   of barrels is about a hundred thousand so with all the bluster and all of this you're right actually
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.580]   it's because the interest rate increases are actually having an effect correct you know
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.020]   these rate increases are like chemotherapy you know it's um on the economy the gas is going to be a lot of money
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:28.560]   the gas demand is lower than the summer of 2020 in the middle of the pandemic yeah yeah you're right
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.420]   so the the Commodity prices are reflecting expectations that the economy is slowing down
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:40.020]   and and you know maybe in a recession so supply supply modestly up demand massively down equals
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.360]   hey we want to get people to buy this Commodity it will lower the prices lo and behold the same thing
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.160]   is happening a little bit with groceries uh and we'll see what happens with travel homes also
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.120]   spectacularly falling down in price
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:59.280]   and the inventory spiking as well so what's your your take here you unpack the 75 basis point
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.760]   increase in the chemotherapy that you were going down that road well let me just speak to this this
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.900]   um this rally in the market for a second because I think there was a really interesting chart that
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:12.540]   Philippe Lafon showed at that kotu Summit that we talked about on the spot a few months ago and I'll
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:20.040]   just put it on the screen I put in the chat uh what it basically shows is that uh is that during you
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.560]   know protracted bear markets you can still get substantial bear market rallies and so during the
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:38.340]   2000 2001.com crash you had these plus 32 plus 41 plus 45 rallies but even while the market as a
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:44.580]   whole was going down and so they ended up being sort of sucker rallies now I don't know if that
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:49.140]   is what's happening here but it is a possibility um one interpretation facts of this could be that
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.000]   the prospects of this could be people are picking the winning stocks while the losers continue to
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.620]   lose and that's what's causing this you know jagged Edge or the the dead count bounce dead
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.060]   cat bouncing as they say which is what we're seeing in a lot of these public companies right
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.960]   I don't know if you're watching but Uber you know obviously I'm still a big shareholder had a massive
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.300]   print and other companies have been doing equally as well Apple included I think two things happened
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:17.580]   last week one is there were a number of companies that reported uh good earnings and I think even
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.960]   more importantly has strong
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.480]   forecasts so that helped and I think it was just there was so much pessimism and negativity that
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:31.380]   just companies reporting decreases that weren't as bad as people were expecting created some room to
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.180]   move up but the other thing that that drove the rally is that the Fed made these comments on the
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:42.840]   heels of that 75 basis point rate increase that we were close to neutral and so the market seemed to
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.900]   get really optimistic that we wouldn't get much more in the in the way of rate increases maybe
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:54.240]   there would be a 50 basis point rate increase towards the end of the year which would bring the
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:00.300]   Fed funds rate up to about the two-year bond rate so the idea was we're close to neutral and markets
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:06.180]   really reacted to that the thing about that is though that I think what the what Powell and what
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:12.720]   the Fed says today about rates is way less important than what the inflation data will
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.480]   actually show in a few months if we still have nine percent inflation three months from now
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:24.900]   then I don't think the rate increases are done so at the end of the day I think that the data here is
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.160]   going to be a lot more important than what the Fed says because certainly the Fed has said a lot of
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.420]   things over the past couple years that turned out not to be true you would agree they seem to be
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:39.660]   doing something correct here with the 75 Bips you know and taking it a little more seriously it's
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:44.700]   having an impact I'll say it again I've said it now five pods in a row we've never seen a moment
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.300]   in history in American history where when CPI
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:54.780]   has printed successively above five percent that it got under five percent without Fed funds getting
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:01.680]   to that same number so we should all hope that this is the exception that proves the rule but
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:08.640]   there's an enormous amount of data that would tell you that we have to take rates to double
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.700]   what the equilibrium rate is thought to be right now there was no print in August they take the
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.240]   month of August off they could do an emergency print and then they're expecting 50 or 75
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:24.720]   Bips in September if they do that Sachs Chamath 50 I think 50 is the expectation for September but
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.160]   look I think it's appropriate now after all the rate increase they've done to take a pause they're
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.440]   going to get two full months now of inflation data before the September Fed meeting I think
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:40.260]   it's appropriate to let the economy digest these rate increases and see where we're at and let's
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.640]   see where the next two months inflation print is and then that'll determine what happens next
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.180]   freeberg based on all this uh what's your Outlook for
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:56.340]   the economy I think there's more we all try and be predictive based on the current set of conditions
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:05.400]   in the world and there are a number of conditions in the world that the switch could flip very
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:13.560]   quickly and there's enough of those triggering events right now that um the probability of any
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.580]   one or any set of them happening in the next couple of months is probably pretty high
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.840]   uh you know I kind of talked about it on the show a few weeks ago that it's like a bunch of
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   tortoises sticking their head out of the shell and you know there's a few that might pop out here
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.740]   there's obviously a massive problem with getting gas to Western Europe for this winter
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:42.240]   there's an emerging problem with food insecurity in Africa South Asia around the world
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.520]   there is obviously continuing escalating conflict
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:54.240]   in Eastern Europe this NATO situation may or may not help the Taiwan visit may or may not help is
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:02.280]   it escalating yeah I mean I think you know Sweden and and whatnot joining NATO is okay it's going to
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:10.440]   be viewed as provocatory and you know it it could not make things cooler and calmer over there but
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.000]   make them more tense I mean we view it as a security issue but it really is a conflict
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.820]   escalation issue and um and then I think that there are emerging markets problems you know
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:27.960]   Argentina is facing 60 inflation Brazil has a criminal as their president right now and he has
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.520]   said publicly in the last couple of days that he will not leave office if he loses the election
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.260]   because the election is fraudulent and if that happens then you could see massive civil unrest
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:42.120]   he's been encouraging the population in Brazil to go to the streets and fight back and there
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.580]   are a number of these flashpoints and by the way that's a massive
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:53.700]   uh you know a food supplier as well as a massive holding in EM credit portfolios around the world
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:59.880]   U.S consumer credit is a problem you know we just had the largest number of new credit card accounts
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:07.200]   open since 2008 in Q2 from the New York Fed report yesterday all of these things I'm painting as
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:14.280]   pictures of potential flash points for what could quickly become wildfires or brush fires that spread
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.260]   very quickly in markets and could escalate some of the considerations so I don't feel like I look
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.660]   around and say everything is good we're in a good place there are some indications that some of the
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.160]   stagflationary considerations and concerns we may have had in the way that markets are behaving
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.920]   right now gives us a pause gives us a respite makes us feel okay but there are also a lot of
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.840]   things that could go wrong and any one of those things could be a triggering point so I always
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.920]   think in terms of probabilities there's a whole bunch of low probability things but when you have
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.900]   enough low probability things the probability that something in the set is triggered becomes
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.280]   high that's where I kind of say look the probability of something being a flashpoint
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:59.340]   for us this year is high I also still think that globally we are very primed for conflict right now
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:04.500]   and we feel like and are hoping that the Russia Ukraine thing resolves but there are other points
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.600]   of escalation look at what's happening with Pelosi visiting Taiwan everyone that's you
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.560]   know even well informed is scratching their head saying what the heck is going on here there is
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:13.860]   currently
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:19.200]   an indulgence in conflict and I think that that indulgence will um you know cause more harm than
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.720]   good uh particularly for these financial markets that we're commenting on right now in the months
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:31.020]   ahead so um look I you know like I've always said I'm not going to be one to time markets it's like
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.300]   trying to time social behavior like who's going to say some word first I don't know the answer in
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.780]   a population of people you know you can kind of guess how people are going to behave but markets
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.800]   are the output the manifestation of social behavior and so timing
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.940]   markets is very difficult I think you can do a good job analyzing businesses and the quality
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.440]   of businesses and how they will perform over time I don't think that anyone over time can do a good
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.120]   job timing markets and I think that there's a lot of these things that could really shift anyone's
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.460]   perspective on what you believe right now very rapidly in another direction based on any one of
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:08.940]   these uh things happening trim off do you feel the world is uh as Dr doom here is you know setting it
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.420]   up I'm not by the way I'm not being negative I'm just pointing out that there are a set of things
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.480]   that could flip things the other way right absolutely I'm being slightly facetious here
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.500]   but you paint a pretty stark picture of hey there's all these tipping points around the
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:24.480]   world chamath do you feel like this is how the world works there's always a bunch of potential
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.380]   tipping points there's always going to be wars sadly and there's always going to be countries
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:34.620]   uh that are dealing with dictators or insolvency especially in frontier markets and emerging
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:42.360]   markets or is this chaos you know really acute and and people should be uh you know
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:48.180]   anxious and in a panic I think both of you guys are right like there's always stuff going on in
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:55.200]   markets and markets represent the collective sum of our wishes and expectations and also the realities
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.480]   this is why I think for me at least the way that I process this information is not trying to have an
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.960]   opinion on any one of those things because I just I find it too hard and I don't have enough depth
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.340]   of understanding of any of those things for me I'd rather go back to the historical Trends because
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:22.620]   I find a little bit easier to parse and whether any of those things are true and can they turn that
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:29.460]   radio down Jason we're we're just talking something oh okay no problem I it's just a little we can't
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.840]   hear you sorry I'm gonna no problem the second helicopter is replacing the first helicopter
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.180]   because swapping out yeah no that's a big helicopters are switching on the helicopter I
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.160]   mean it takes a team to part this
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:53.580]   so the the real problem is that like if I go back to the historical artifacts have there been issues
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:00.420]   in the past the way that you know um freeberg described absolutely so this is why I think you
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.380]   can look at the fact that whenever there's inflation and whenever it's spiked this what
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:10.980]   has had to happen by the Fed is you have to take rates above that key five percent threshold when
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:16.860]   the CPI is above five percent to break enough demand so that the economy's reset
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.900]   and I think that's where we are so instead of trying to figure out whether you know I mean the
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.940]   the Brazil thing as an example that that freeberg said is crazy like he's basically you know he said
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:32.880]   publicly in a press release the army is on my side and it's ready to help me you know keep and stay
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.560]   in just the craziest thing so what are you supposed to do the fighters need to take to the streets
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.180]   so what are you so what are you supposed to do in my opinion I'm like you know what a version of
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:47.700]   Brazil has happened before I don't know enough history quite honest you know the specifics of
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.640]   what happened then and how that could translate to now and I don't want to spend the time
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.900]   understanding what's going to happen in Brazil right now I'd rather just say there are 20 or
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:34:00.900]   30 things that could very much complicate the world economy I think the reality is that
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:07.500]   governments need to flush all this excess money out of the system so that we can really find out
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.020]   what equilibrium demand is and get back to normal there's also by the way a really important trend
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:19.620]   chamath unlike that I think is playing out and will play out for the next decade on deglobalization
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:27.840]   so as the U.S tries to build its own semiconductor manufacturing capacity as China loses key trade
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.300]   partners as all of these markets stop trading with each other and start to build redundancy
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.200]   there is a massive longer range economic effect of
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:44.100]   deglobalization globalization enables efficient pricing it enables labor and energy and everything
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:49.140]   to be done you know to go to the cheapest source that's the way globalization has benefited us
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.720]   we've been able to get cheap energy and cheap labor in overseas markets to do work for us and
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.640]   as a result we've gotten access to cheap products so when you deglobalize you end up having to pay
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.380]   more for labor more for energy you have to build infrastructure and the price for everything goes
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.140]   up we've said this on the pod for two years now
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:15.720]   that era of cheaper faster better is over and what comes with that is better National Security
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.840]   but the cost of that better National Security is higher prices higher prices less growth and
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.560]   there's nothing that we can do to avoid that I'm not sure I agree with the less growth I actually
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.720]   think that there's enough excess slack to be absorbed by all of this free money that I think
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:36.120]   you can still have sustained growth but it will come with higher interest rates and higher inflation
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.020]   and higher input
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.660]   costs everybody will have to do their part to absorb some of this but that's what's going to
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.740]   happen and I think we should just deal with the medicine as quickly as possible this is why the
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.700]   people that actually think that the fed should just be very aggressive and get this over with
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.780]   quickly I suspect on the margins are right the problem is they don't want to look at the historical
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.520]   artifact because they sort of artifact would say wait I need to raise interest rates by another 250
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:04.200]   basis points that's just way too disruptive for what the world is ready to to hear right now so
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.960]   we're going to incrementally plot along
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.980]   and I think what freebrook says is right which is that there's going to be a whack-a-mole that emerges
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:15.420]   that's going to tilt the markets then the consumer credit thing will implode that's going to tilt the
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:20.820]   markets then Jair bolsonaro will try to take over Brazil that'll tilt the markets and we'll go back
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:26.880]   to this you know inflationary fragmented de-globalized view of the world that just
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.380]   frankly takes higher interest rates to normalize all right and sax I'll bring you on this I mean
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:36.780]   counter to freebrook's point the the counter obviously would be hey we will have less
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:43.980]   dependency on dictators like Putin Xi Jinping MBS Etc and that would be great for humanity and
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:50.040]   we'd have resiliency in our supply chain uh and you know the West now becoming unified
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:56.100]   say what you will about the NATO membership and the timing of it it's probably a great thing that
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:01.380]   the West is saying hey we're going to get together as a group I think you would agree and stand
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.720]   against dictators invading other countries and if everybody pays their fair share to be part of NATO
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.760]   that's not that's not what they said that's not what it is well I mean no that is not but look be
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.580]   intellectually honest every day we all said the first part and just nobody talked about that
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.680]   second part and the only person who you know which is Josh Holly who's you know not exactly my
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.060]   favorite person in the world but maybe sax wants to comment was the only one that actually said
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.780]   which is probably the fair thing with Jason you are saying is part of the deal it is not part of
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.960]   the deal no no should be part of the deal I'm saying it should be part of the deal and for
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.440]   people who missed what we said there United States spends three and a half percent of our
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.840]   GDP on uh military other places in NATO might be spending one or two percent and we're trying to
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:49.080]   get them all to two percent to be a little closer to us and then this obviously trip to Taiwan
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.120]   strengthening our relationship with that country but at what cost and why are we doing it now uh
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.740]   all come into play here so do you actually think that this trip to Taiwan actually strengthened our
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:03.900]   relationship with Taiwan did we come out with a deal for chips did it see all of a sudden say
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:10.920]   in what way I'm curious well because they are I mean did you not see their statements and giving
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.960]   Pelosi Awards and they Taiwan very much wants to strengthen their relationship with the West that
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.040]   that is their goal they want to strengthen the West they want the protection of the West so yes
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.240]   it's trying to get this was a coordinated hold on let me finish it does strengthen our relationship
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.460]   with Taiwan the question is does it provoke China and was it necessary at this point in time in
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.840]   history when the world does feel like uh it's a little bit of a powder keg no but so so six
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.400]   months from now when all the fruits and vegetables that have been embargoed and not sent to Taiwan and
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.880]   then the sand that allows them to make chips continues to not flow do you think that they'll
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:47.580]   still be positive about the trip we'll see I mean I I let's go to Sax he likes to comment on these
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:52.140]   things so all right well I want to dismantle everything you just said I know that's why I
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:58.020]   set you up for it so I'm Pelosi I mean look once it came out that Pelosi was going to Taiwan and
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:03.780]   China threatened her and the U.S saying you can't go obviously we couldn't back down from
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:10.440]   that because we can't let China dictate which of our officials can go to Taiwan so at that point we
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:16.320]   had to back her play and you saw that everybody from Fox News to 25 Republican senators got on
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.320]   board okay but here's the issue the real issue is should she even have been going I think this
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:28.800]   trip was self-indulgent it was reckless she was told by the Biden administration don't go this
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.720]   is not the right time this is a sensitive time the uh the CCP's
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.120]   got their party conference in the next couple of months there was no reason to basically provoke
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:45.420]   this showdown right now and she just dismissed what the administration with Biden and what the
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.880]   Pentagon told her to do because she wanted to make some sort of valedictory tour to Taiwan
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:58.260]   so look Nancy Pelosi does not deserve any credit for this trip did we have to defend her once
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:03.660]   you know once China threatened her yes of course we had to like I said back her play but
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.640]   this was reckless and it was self-indulgent and it didn't need to happen and you know it
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.740]   really makes you wonder who is calling the shots in this administration when Pelosi won't even
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:19.440]   respect the wishes of a president in her own party and what is she doing going over there
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.060]   she's not the secretary of state I had the same president had the same questions like why why now
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:29.460]   why not Thomas Freeman had well because it's all about her making this valedictory tour
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.600]   before she's going to hand over the gavel look the Democrats are going to lose the
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:39.060]   house in November once she passes the gavel to a new Republican speaker of the house I think she'll
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.740]   be announcing her retirement shortly after that so this is all part of her farewell tour
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:51.180]   but it didn't need to happen and the fact that she did it in violation of the wishes of a president
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:56.760]   of her own party makes you wonder who's calling the shots over there and it kind of reminded me
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:03.000]   you know a few weeks ago Gavin Newsom was over at the White House when Biden was over in Europe and
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.540]   everyone was
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.680]   translating what's he doing over there is he measuring in drapes yeah he's measuring the drapes
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:13.200]   so you know it just goes to show this does this administration have control over anything over
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.920]   the members of their own party over 60 of Democrats say they want someone different to run in 24. so
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:26.880]   yes there was a surface level of consensus and backing of Pelosi but if you scratch beneath the
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:32.760]   surface you see that the trip was unnecessary and reveals a president who doesn't seem completely in
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.480]   control of our foreign policy
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.820]   so in a statement um almost universally uh the leadership of the Republican Party said for
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.200]   decades members of the U.S United States Congress including previous speakers of the house have
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.180]   traveled to Taiwan this travel is consistent with the United States one China policy to which we are
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:55.680]   committed we are also committed now more than ever to all elements of the Taiwan relations act so one
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:02.220]   China if you don't know is that Taiwan and China are all part of one uh unified uh entity so we're
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:07.560]   the Republicans seem to be supporting this in a cynical way you're saying or it is consistent that
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:12.060]   uh other members of the United States Congress have gone including other speakers of the house
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:17.340]   I think there is bipartisan support now to defend Taiwan I actually think that that is in the cards I
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:24.780]   think there's a very high probability that we actually end up in a war with China really this
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:30.480]   century oh yeah I don't think so I think so much flashpoint in the world uh I would agree with that
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.380]   but explain why you think there's going to be a war because I think a lot of people think there's way
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.520]   too much at stake here for there to be a war so there is going to be some sort of negotiated
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.540]   settlement in the South China Sea so why would you think you think the majority cases there's
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:47.220]   going to be a war really you you have to look at it first of all from the Chinese point of view
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:53.400]   they view Taiwan as sacred territory and for decades now they have said in every single
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.980]   meeting diplomatic meeting with the U.S Taiwan is always their number one issue they are hell bent on
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.420]   recent history unification
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:07.500]   of mainland China with Taiwan and they would like to do it peacefully through coercion if they can
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.780]   but I think they will do it militarily if they must and the only question is when they feel that
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.700]   they will be strong enough to basically take the island by force so that's I think the Chinese
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:25.260]   point of view and I think America is increasingly committed to the defense of Taiwan so you know we
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.460]   have contradictory statements on this though the one China policy says that
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:36.720]   we respect that there's one China but on the other hand the Taiwan Relations Act commits us to help in
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:43.440]   the defense of Taiwan so we have a contradictory policy on this but if you really want to understand
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.940]   as does Saks you would agree China has flip-flopped on this and it's only the last hundred years that
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.300]   they've really considered Taiwan strategic they didn't care about it two or three hundred years
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.800]   ago they were kind of like this is worthless you guys do what you want Taiwan was part of
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.400]   China until 1895 when Japan took it from them yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.480]   they didn't want it at that time that's that's the other thing they were like this is worthless
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   real estate we don't care it's only true well Taiwan Taiwan is extremely important strategically
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:15.120]   and if you want to understand why I think you need to look at this map yes no I read up on that I think
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.540]   it's really interesting pull that up actually yeah it's a really interesting discussion because 200
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.060]   years ago they didn't care and then all of a sudden they're like wait a second if we're going
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:25.560]   to be in wars with the West and Japan's going to be a democracy we do actually have something at
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.340]   stake here we'd like that island back the island chain strategy was originally created
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:37.140]   by John Foster Dulles this one of the Secretary of State I think under Eisenhower who was one of
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.980]   the initial architects of our containment policy against the Soviet Union but also came with this
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:48.060]   idea of how we would contain China in East Asia and the basic idea is that China is surrounded
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:53.220]   by a series of island chains the first island chain goes down from the southern tip of Japan
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:59.280]   to Okinawa to Taiwan to I think there's some islands of the South China Sea the Spratly
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.800]   Islands uh it's got the Northwest tip of the Philippines that's the first Island chain second
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:11.280]   Island chain goes out to Vietnam Eastern part of the Philippines no Vietnam's all the way down and
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:18.720]   I think it's second Island chain includes you know it goes down to Indonesia and then I think there's
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.860]   even a third Island chain that includes Guam although Guam actually might be in the second
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.540]   somewhere it's somewhere around there it's a heavily fortified American base so the idea is if
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.220]   you want to bottle up and contain China
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:37.080]   you do it by controlling these island chains and Taiwan is really the central one it sort of divides
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.480]   this East China Sea uh where you've got South Korea and Japan from the South China Sea where
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:48.780]   you've got Vietnam and Malaysia between Vietnam and Japan it's literally if you were to draw a
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:54.120]   center line of China's coastal access that is it yeah so so the bottom line is this if you want to
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:59.160]   pursue a policy of containment against China you really want to control these island chains
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:04.860]   another way to think about it is that these islands are unsinkable aircraft carriers
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:12.300]   they allow America to project power 6 000 miles away into the Pacific that's how we saw it during
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.980]   World War II is we had all these island hopping battles and as we took these islands they would
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:22.140]   then become a runway for the next stage of to project American power to get all the way to
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:28.500]   to Japan so you know if you believe that we're headed for or we already are in Cold War II
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:35.400]   with China and I think we are I think China is really I think we'd all be a political threat not
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:41.400]   Russia the way that you would contain China and keep them bottled up is to have these uh islands
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.620]   in the American alliance it's gonna be very hard for China which is now building a huge blue water
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.520]   Navy has actually more ships in the United States it's gonna be very hard for them to project their
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.800]   power all over the world if they are contained a bottle up and have to watch their own back one
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.720]   put on the number of ships though in East Asia is you know they they have a lot of small ships the
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:06.540]   tonnage wise we have much more tonnage and if you were to look you know even uh the the perfect
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.100]   setup as you explained through these islands is very similar to NATO and the um what's happening
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:17.820]   with Russia you know we have Korea we have Japan uh we have Vietnam the Philippines we have an
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:24.420]   incredible Alliance in this area and that's a great thing for America and Taiwan obviously is a
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.680]   jump ball here uh
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:31.740]   um but this is a setup for China you know having Jason what do you think about the repercussions of
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:38.460]   her visit so CATL which is Tesla's biggest battery supplier basically you know delayed the announcement
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.960]   of a of a factory it's not clear whether they're going to put it into the United States they may
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.700]   actually pick a city in Mexico but what the decision that was supposed to happen now has
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:52.020]   now been delayed until September or October there's a bunch of you know there's all of
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.500]   these crazy military drills that happened was it all worth it I mean
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:01.140]   that is the question and I I'm asking you now was it worth it we don't have enough information I
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:06.600]   think to know what why this was done now it was it a freelance he asked me a question let me finish
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:12.540]   is is it a freelance and Nancy Pelosi is completely freelance or is there a bigger strategy here is
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:19.620]   the question is China weak now are we trying to send a message to them and one could equally take
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:25.080]   the side of the argument that the United States supporting Finland uh supporting Sweden supporting
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:31.440]   NATO you know supporting the Ukraine and supporting the Pacific is actually the right move here to
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.940]   contain the dictators I agree but we have a I agree but we have two people to do that it's the
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.680]   president and the secretary of state well that would be a much bigger provocation I think is the
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.120]   issue so if you sent the president that would be a very big provocation the Thomas Friedman article
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.820]   that Sachs mentions yeah it was pretty explicit that you know Blinken and Biden both told her
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.900]   please stand down yeah the NSC and the
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:00.240]   joint chief said please stand down you are way over your ski tips here and she's great I agree
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:05.400]   I I I've been very public what is the point of doing this now is the question and we don't have
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:11.760]   information once China tried to dictate to Pelosi that she couldn't go of course we had to back her
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:17.040]   play but you have to be kind of a fool to fall for this in the first place this was self-indulgent by
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:21.540]   Pelosi she didn't need to pick this battle the administration asked her not to and look let me
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.840]   give Biden some credit here Biden has the right policy on Taiwan
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:31.500]   which was stated this way he says that we support the status quo and we are against unilateral changes
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:36.900]   to the status quo we want the United States to be a status quo power with respect to Taiwan and force
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.940]   China to be the revisionist power and we need to be very careful that we do not come across as the
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:48.180]   revisionist power that would give China an excuse so we want to just maintain the status quo that
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:51.780]   should be our policy all right everybody we'll see you next time on the all-in pod bye-bye
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.720]   foreign

[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.940]   We should all just get a room
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.540]   And just have one big huge orgy
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.480]   Cause they're all just useless
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.180]   It's like this sexual tension
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.620]   That we just need to release somehow

[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.380]   I'm doing all in
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:48.400]   I'm doing all in
