[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   [silence]
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.500]   Now, some of you may already be doing
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.040]   low repetition, pure strength work,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.760]   but I believe that most people don't.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.560]   Most people who do resistance training
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.440]   are using either machines or free weights
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.280]   or some combination of those,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.320]   or perhaps are using body weight.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.360]   And they tend to focus on repetition ranges
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.360]   from about five and usually more like six repetitions
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.280]   out to about 10 and perhaps 15 repetitions.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.120]   Now, of course, doing resistance training
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.240]   in repetition ranges of five to 15 reps per set,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.000]   provided it's done at sufficient intensity,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.440]   so either to failure or close to failure,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.380]   of course, in good form, is tremendously beneficial.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.280]   It can help build strength, it can enhance hypertrophy.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.920]   There is tremendous value to training
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.800]   in those repetition ranges.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.900]   But when I sat down with Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.560]   to discuss resistance training specifically,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.120]   he made it very clear that at least for some portion
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.600]   of one's yearly training cycle,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.040]   so perhaps eight weeks or 10 weeks,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.920]   or in the case that I adopted, 12 weeks,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.440]   there is tremendous benefit to training
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.360]   in the three to five repetition range and maybe even lower.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.120]   So the second tool of training specifically for strength
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.760]   in this three to five repetition range
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.800]   is something that I started to incorporate
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.320]   after I sat down to record that series.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440]   And I'll just tell you a few of the benefits
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.400]   that I've experienced,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.200]   and then I'll tell you the specific protocol
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020]   that makes it very easy to do this.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.400]   The most obvious benefit to me was that I got much stronger,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.240]   and that that strength persisted
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.520]   such that when I went back to using higher repetition ranges,
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.640]   so typically I trained with weights or machines
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.560]   in the six to 10 repetition range,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.800]   sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.680]   but never before had I specifically trained
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.480]   in the three to five repetition range exclusively
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.760]   for a period of 10 to 12 weeks.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.160]   And when I did that, I, of course, gained strength,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.360]   but that strength stayed with me
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.720]   such that when I returned to higher repetition ranges,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   I could use more weight in good form,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.560]   and that, of course,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.280]   enhanced strength and hypertrophy further.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.240]   In addition, there was another effect
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.600]   that was, at least to me, very unexpected,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.200]   which was that my cardiovascular training
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.920]   improved significantly.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.760]   Now, why would this be?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.040]   Because typically a three to five repetition set
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   does not elevate the heart rate for long enough
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.300]   that you would consider it cardiovascular training.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.160]   And of course, the rest periods between those sets
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.340]   is pretty long as well.
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.840]   So even if heart rate goes up during those heavy sets,
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.560]   it's going to go down during those long
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.400]   three to five minute rest periods between those sets.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   But what I noticed was that my overall posture
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.560]   and my ability to maintain cardiovascular output
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.000]   while using good running form or good rowing form
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.040]   was also vastly improved.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.880]   And the logical interpretation of why that would be
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.140]   is simply that the muscles got stronger
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.080]   and those same muscles are being incorporated
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.760]   into the cardiovascular, let's call it endurance work
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.120]   that I'm doing on other days,
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.940]   and therefore I can carry out
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.120]   those cardiovascular training sessions in better form
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.280]   for longer periods of time.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.960]   I actually felt much stronger
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.840]   during my cardiovascular training
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.760]   as I got much stronger moving these heavier weight loads
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.640]   for low repetition sets.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.360]   And then the third specific benefit that I noticed
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.380]   is that when training heavy
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.200]   for three to five repetitions per set, I didn't get sore.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.720]   And this to me was an incredible benefit
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.000]   because typically when I train in the six repetition
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.560]   to 15 repetition range,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.480]   and I take those sets to failure or near failure,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.320]   I do experience some soreness the next day.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.600]   Ordinarily that soreness isn't so intense
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.780]   that it prevents me from doing
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.920]   any of the other sorts of workouts that I do.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.440]   And for those of you that have visited
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.200]   that foundational fitness protocol,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.040]   you know that I hit each major and minor muscle group
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.600]   once per week directly,
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.680]   as well as once per week indirectly.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.220]   That's the overall structure of that program.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.280]   In order to allow sufficient recovery
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.020]   between those resistance training workouts
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.360]   to be able to make continual progress.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.320]   Now, by training in this three to five repetition range
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.900]   that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested,
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.400]   I was able to improve my strength,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.360]   improve my cardiovascular output, reduce soreness.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.080]   I also just felt better overall.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.060]   I had a lot more energy after those workouts
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.500]   than I typically do after my resistance training sessions
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.520]   when I use higher repetition ranges.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.880]   There were just a number of different things
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.160]   that made me feel, wow, this is really a powerful protocol.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.840]   And of course, moving heavier weights in the gym
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.000]   feels good too.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.180]   It feels good to get stronger.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.440]   At least there's a positive feedback there for me.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.200]   And I think for most people.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.120]   And I should also mention that for those of you
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.460]   that are averse to doing heavier resistance training
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.240]   in this three to five repetition range,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.680]   because you fear that it will make you too big or too bulky,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.400]   training in the low repetition ranges
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.640]   is actually more geared towards increasing strength
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   and is shifting away somewhat
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.100]   from increasing hypertrophy or muscle size.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.300]   So that's a great benefit for those of you
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.600]   that want to be strong and also want to maintain
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.080]   cardiovascular fitness,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960]   but you don't want to add muscular size.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.220]   And of course, for all of you that want to add muscular size,
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.040]   it's well-established that increasing your strength
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.800]   will allow you then to return to patterns
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.320]   of hypertrophy training that will allow you
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.680]   to use heavier weights
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.480]   and therefore induce greater hypertrophy.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.760]   So there are oh so many reasons to incorporate
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.800]   these strength training protocols.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.640]   So the way that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested one do it,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.840]   and it was the way that I did it,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.360]   is to use this three by five protocol.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.320]   The three by five protocol is very straightforward.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.240]   It involves doing three to five exercises per workout, okay?
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.920]   So if it's a workout for legs, it's three to five exercises.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.560]   If it's a workout for some upper body muscle,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.240]   it's three to five exercises.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.240]   Three to five exercises for three to five sets per exercise,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.840]   three to five repetitions per set,
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.800]   and three to five minutes of rest between each set.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.400]   In addition, he emphasized that one can do those workouts
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.360]   three to five times per week.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   Although I'm going to put an asterisk
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.080]   next to that last statement,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   because I found that I couldn't do the three by five protocol
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.160]   say for legs specifically, three to five times per week.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   I realized that might be possible for some people,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   but I'm somebody who, like many of you out there,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.960]   either doesn't have the time
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   or doesn't have the recovery capacity
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.160]   to train my legs three to five times per week.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.300]   Even though I acknowledge
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.120]   that there are probably ways to do that
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.780]   that would still allow me to recover,
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.220]   it just simply starts to impede
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.540]   into other areas of training.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.760]   It starts to impede other areas of life
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.440]   like work and family and sleep and all the rest.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.740]   So what I did and what I'm suggesting you try
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.040]   is for any existing resistance training that you're doing
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.640]   to take a period of eight or 10 or ideally 12 weeks
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.680]   and do the vast majority,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.480]   if not all of that resistance training
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.240]   in the lower repetition range
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.280]   that's designed specifically to induce strength adaptations
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.900]   and to not pay attention to whether or not
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.640]   you're hitting that same muscle group
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.440]   three to five times per week.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.280]   Rather, if you train your legs once or twice per week
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.400]   to simply do all of the work for your legs
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.520]   in that three to five repetition range.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.160]   If you train an upper body muscle or muscle groups,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.320]   chest, shoulders, back once per week or twice per week
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.400]   to just stay within that three to five repetition range
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.420]   for those work sets, right?
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.480]   Warmups can include a few more reps.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.480]   And then to adhere to this three to five exercises,
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.720]   three to five sets per exercise,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.760]   three to five repetitions per set
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.420]   and three to five minutes between sets.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.760]   Now, the one exception to this that I incorporated
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.960]   was that for very small muscle groups.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.840]   So for instance, the rear deltoids or for neck work
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.080]   or for calf work to not rely purely
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.520]   on three to five repetitions,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.640]   but maybe to work in a range of anywhere
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.680]   from five to eight repetitions.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.620]   So still fairly low repetitions,
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.240]   but not so low that it restricts you
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.640]   to three to five repetitions.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.760]   The reason for that is that I,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.080]   and I think a lot of people out there,
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.160]   find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.840]   adequately with good form
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.760]   when restricting oneself to those low repetitions.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.080]   However, for big compound movements like presses
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.840]   and squats and deadlifts and glute ham raises
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.560]   and things of that sort,
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   maybe even leg extensions and leg curls,
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.480]   which are isolation exercises, of course,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.120]   to really restrict oneself
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.240]   to those three to five repetition ranges
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.760]   that take you to failure or near failure.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.720]   I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.000]   And I'm confident that you will also experience
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.160]   a lot of benefits.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.380]   So just to remind you what some of those benefits are,
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.760]   you get stronger, which feels great.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.620]   That occurs within your weight workouts,
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.060]   but it also carries over
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.840]   to your endurance training sessions.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.080]   I also noticed that when we're returning
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.600]   to higher repetitions for resistance training,
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.200]   so after 12 weeks,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.760]   shifting away from three to five repetition ranges
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.880]   and going back to training
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.520]   in the six to 10 repetition ranges mainly,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.820]   occasionally up to 12 or 15,
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.160]   but really mainly restricting to six to 10 repetitions,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.840]   that you can move much heavier weights in good form
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.640]   and thereby induce more hypertrophy
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.080]   while still also continuing to gain some strength.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.920]   And another benefit was, again, reduced soreness
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.640]   compared to when training with higher repetition ranges
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   and more mental freshness.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.400]   It's, I guess, the only way to describe it
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.200]   when training in those lower repetition ranges.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.040]   I don't know about you,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.000]   but when I finish a really hard hour-long
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.160]   resistance training session
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.180]   done in the six to 12 repetition range,
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.920]   there's a certain type of mental fatigue
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.000]   that even if I eat properly afterwards,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.700]   even if I hydrate properly,
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.840]   that it tends to sap a bit of my mental energy
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.960]   later in the day,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.560]   but that the training at the three to five repetition range
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.880]   did just the opposite.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.700]   It actually enhanced my focus and my cognition,
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.960]   my overall levels of physical energy,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.120]   which is great because it allows you to do
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.960]   all the other things
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.560]   that we're required to do throughout the day,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.680]   and by the way,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.520]   it'll also allow you to get more of that zone two cardio.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.100]   [upbeat music]
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.520]   [upbeat music]
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.320]   (upbeat music)
