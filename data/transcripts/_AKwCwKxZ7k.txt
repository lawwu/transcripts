[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.480]   - All right.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.760]   Folks, welcome back.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.960]   Most of you already know I am John Luskin
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.360]   and I'm gonna be moderating our withdrawal rate rumble today.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.840]   We've got three very special guests.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.480]   One was just interviewed about an hour ago,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.320]   so he doesn't need much of an introduction,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.120]   if he did anyway in the first place.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.400]   That's Mr. Bengen, creator of the so-called 4% rule.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.760]   And then on the other side of the panel,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.080]   we have Christine Benz,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.640]   Director of Personal Finance and Retirement Planning
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.080]   at Morningstar.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.800]   Her latest book is entitled How to Retire,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   20 Lessons for a Happy, Successful, and Wealthy Retirement.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.080]   Christine was recently on the Bogleheads
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.760]   on Investing podcast with host, Rick Ferry,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.040]   talking about those 20 lessons.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.200]   So you folks can check that out on boglecenter.net.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.760]   That's episode 73, the most recent episode.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160]   And then last but not least,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.720]   our gentleman in the middle,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.560]   Carsten Biggern-Jeske, retired in 2018
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.600]   after a long career in academia, government,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   and corporate America.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.440]   On his blog, Early Retirement Now,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.080]   he writes on all topics related to personal finance.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.920]   He's best known for his comprehensive series
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.000]   on safe withdrawal rates.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.520]   Now folks, just like last time,
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.000]   I have some questions I prepared ahead of time,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.520]   but I know you have your questions,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   so please write them down on piece of paper,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.640]   hold them up, and then Mike Piper right over there,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.360]   give us a wave, Mike.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.200]   He is gonna be collecting them.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.720]   All right, let's get started with a quick review
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.760]   of all your research on retirement planning.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.680]   Again, we recently just had Mr. Bingen
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.640]   talk about the 4% rule.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.200]   Let's turn it over to Carsten and Christine.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080]   Tell us a little bit about what you found
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.200]   about sustainable spending in retirement.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.920]   - Yeah, so hi, I'm Carsten,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560]   and people often ask me,
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.240]   Carsten, you write so much about safe withdrawal rates,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240]   you must be really nervous
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440]   about running out of money in retirement.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.920]   And actually, it's the other way around.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.000]   So people ask me, you must be really nervous
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   about running out of money,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.440]   and I say, no, it's actually the other way around,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.960]   by doing your analysis right,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.200]   and looking at your numbers,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.240]   and looking at your plan,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.840]   and kicking the tires from every possible angle
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   that gives you more confidence to retire,
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.800]   and gives you more courage
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.680]   to actually take money out of your account, right?
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.800]   So unlike maybe some other fire bloggers,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.520]   I actually take money out of my account.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.480]   So I get a little bit of revenue from my blog,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.320]   but most of my retirement spending
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.120]   comes out of my portfolio.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.920]   And so when I got ready to retire,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.480]   I mean, obviously I knew about Bill's work, right?
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.840]   It's legendary, and it's not Bill's fault,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.200]   but it was too generic for me personally, right?
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.840]   I'm not a 30-year traditional retiree,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.440]   retiring at age 65 with a flat spending profile.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.520]   I had all sorts of other parameters,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.480]   longer horizon, some positive cash flows,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.160]   some negative cash flows in the future, right?
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.240]   I had a bequest motive.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.680]   I don't want to run out of money after 30 years,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.440]   because that would still be considered a success
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800]   in some retirement calculators.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.240]   So I needed to personalize what I do
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.800]   for my personal retirement.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.720]   And some people say,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.160]   obviously 4% rule is a good starting point, and it is,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.240]   but these personal parameters,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.640]   they can shift it all the way down
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.080]   to maybe three and a quarter percent
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.680]   for somebody who is 30 years old
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.640]   and has a 60 or 65-year horizon,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   or you could go up all the way up to 5%
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.560]   for somebody who retires a little bit later
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.160]   who has social security right around the corner.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.320]   And so I wanted to do that exercise right.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.000]   So then my niche in the FIRE community is that,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.200]   I mean, I like to do this personalized analysis
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.480]   both on the personal parameters,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.640]   and then also I'm very careful and cautious
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.840]   because this is really near and dear to my heart,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.200]   both as an economist and former finance,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.000]   asset management professional.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.720]   It's asset valuations matter a lot, right?
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.760]   Especially for people in the FIRE community, right?
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.560]   Because we retire endogenously,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.400]   and we tend to have the retirement date
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.360]   close to the market peak, right?
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.480]   Because we retire when we have enough,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.080]   well, that's positively correlated
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.000]   with retiring right around the market peak.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.440]   And so all of these additional factors that go in,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.680]   and so this is why I started my series,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.600]   and it has been therapeutic to me
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.280]   that I feel more confident in retirement.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.000]   And a lot of people that reach out to me,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.920]   they say, "Yeah, I mean, you gave me the confidence to retire
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.960]   "and they also knew about your work."
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.760]   But they said, "I mean, you pushed me over the edge
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.720]   "to also retire." - Oh, don't blame me.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.440]   (all laughing)
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.800]   - And again, we don't blame him,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.960]   we almost blame other people misinterpreting your results.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.400]   I mean, that's really what happens sometimes
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.880]   as a researcher.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.760]   And because you had to keep it generic, right?
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.000]   You couldn't publish a safe withdrawal rate study
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.480]   for, say, your neighbor, right,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.440]   who has all of these bells and whistles.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.680]   You had to keep it generic and general.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.000]   - Particularly if my neighbor is John Gotti, yeah.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.320]   (all laughing)
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.680]   - So anyway, so this is my little niche.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.360]   I publish a lot on earlyretirementnow.com.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.760]   I have a free early retirement toolkit.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.200]   It's a spreadsheet.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.720]   It's not a program you have to pay for.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.400]   I post this for free.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.760]   You can download this and run your own simulations.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.400]   And it will always stay free.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.240]   People have asked me,
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.240]   "Can't we make this a for-pay product?"
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.640]   And I want to keep this free
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.560]   so people can utilize that without paying for that.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.120]   So anyway, so that's my blog,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.200]   and people seem to enjoy it.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.320]   - So Karsten's blog is really amazing and comprehensive.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.600]   Our team at Morningstar has been doing
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.260]   a state-of-retirement income study every year
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.640]   for the past three years.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.720]   And we very much stand on the shoulders
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.640]   of people who have had a go at this research before.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.840]   So Bill Bengen's research is the starting point
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.160]   for everything that any of us have done in this space.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.480]   But our team does Monte Carlo simulations,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.200]   which were discussed in the previous session with Bill,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.260]   where we attempt to kind of take a forward-looking view.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.840]   We embed our Morningstar Investment Management team's
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.280]   capital markets assumptions,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.600]   so their expectation of stock and bond returns,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.200]   as well as their expected inflation
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.480]   over a 30-year horizon.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.840]   They tend today to be pretty conservative
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.480]   in terms of their U.S. equity forecasts,
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.860]   somewhat more sanguine about non-U.S. equity
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.680]   and fixed income return expectations
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.200]   have gotten a bit better with bond yields rising.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   So first year we did this research in 2021,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.720]   the takeaway was 3.3% would be a good starting
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.520]   withdrawal percentage if you had a 30-year horizon
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.000]   and you wanted to take the same amount out,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.040]   inflation adjusted every year throughout your retirement.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.640]   That was partly because bond yields, as you remember,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.520]   were very, very low at that time.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   Equity valuations were very elevated.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.520]   When we revisited in 2022,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.700]   the number had lifted a little bit,
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.540]   in part because of better bond yields.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.400]   And so it was 3.8% in 2022.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.600]   In 2023, drum roll, it was 4%,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   was the starting safe withdrawal percentage
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.220]   that we came out with.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.840]   But the interesting component of that research,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.640]   I think, is that we do look at a number of different
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.160]   flexible or dynamic strategies,
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.220]   including John Guyton's guardrails strategy
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.280]   that he was here to discuss yesterday.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.520]   And what we do find,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.200]   there are a lot of different variations
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.040]   on these dynamic strategies,
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.000]   but you do tend to get a lift
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.560]   in terms of your starting withdrawal
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.320]   if you're okay with the trade-off
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.040]   that you will potentially have to take less
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.220]   if the market goes down.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.960]   So we explore the pros and cons
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.920]   of the various dynamic strategies.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   One of them is that if you do have a strong bequest motive,
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.640]   dynamic strategy will tend to be less good for that
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.920]   because it's going to encourage you to spend more
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.540]   if your portfolio balance is up.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.680]   So that's a trade-off.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.020]   And like Karsten said, it's very individual specific.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.880]   Some people might say that's not a concern.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.500]   I'm kind of a last breath, last dollar person,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.360]   they might say.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.080]   And so in that case,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   you might be just fine with a dynamic strategy.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.540]   So it is very, very personal,
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.800]   but we explore the pros and cons
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   and the lift that you get with taking a dynamic strategy.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.140]   - Thank you, Christine.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.400]   Mike, I'm ready for you.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.100]   Let's talk about variable portfolio distributions
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.480]   in retirement.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.460]   This one came from Greg Wilson from Vogleheads Facebook.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.760]   He asks about how does one incorporate
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.360]   the go-go, slow-go, and no-go years
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.960]   into your distribution strategy?
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.680]   And before I let you guys answer that,
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.080]   I'll have one of you tackle go-go, slow-go, and no-go
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.620]   for those folks who aren't retirement planning nerds.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.400]   - Yeah, I couldn't hear the question, sorry.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.360]   - It was about spending changes
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   throughout the retirement life cycle
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   and the kind of go-go, slow-go, no-go trajectory
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.200]   that people have had to achieve.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.040]   - For spending?
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.860]   - Okay, that smile thing, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.560]   - I can hop on that.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.400]   - Why don't you start on that?
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   - Because we actually did model that into our research.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.680]   We had some research from EBRI,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.480]   Employee Benefits Research Institute,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.740]   that we used on retiree spending.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.560]   So we modeled in real retiree spending,
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.760]   which does tend to show that pattern,
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.880]   that actually real spending tends to decline
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.680]   by one percentage point less than the inflation rate,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.960]   if you sort of average it out.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.120]   And so we incorporated that into last year's research.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.120]   So if you're thinking that your spending
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.080]   will trend down throughout your life cycle,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.020]   you can take more earlier on.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.360]   So the 4% sort of baseline finding became 5%
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.020]   when we incorporated that natural downturn in spending.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:25.020]   But of course, retirees need to be okay with that trade-off.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.760]   One quick note on the retirement spending smile.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.060]   This is something I discussed
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.840]   in my book with David Blanchett.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.600]   And so there's been so much discussion
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.980]   about this smile idea.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.160]   So spending is going down and then going up.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.040]   And so the upward trajectory
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.640]   obviously relates to healthcare expenses,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.560]   specifically uninsured long-term care costs.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.200]   Catastrophic long-term care costs,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.880]   David pointed out, actually accrue
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   to a fairly small percentage of our retiree population.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.420]   So it's a big number,
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.880]   but it is landing with a small percentage of retirees.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.040]   The problem is you don't know which cohort you'll fall into,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.560]   the person who doesn't need much long-term care
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.400]   or the person who needs a whole lot.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.980]   So anyway, just for what it's worth.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.440]   - So, I mean, I can answer the two.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.160]   One is for me personally
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.840]   and how I would handle this academically
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.360]   if I wanted to model this in my sheet.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.880]   So first of all, the smile doesn't start for me yet, right?
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.800]   Because it usually starts at age 65.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.540]   So I still have a few years to go.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.240]   I am actually more worried about the other way around
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.480]   that if you retire early,
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.120]   say 20 years before normal retirement age,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.760]   and you do only CPI.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.480]   Forget about CPI minus 1%.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.800]   You do only CPI and you're still in your prime years
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.200]   where you want to travel, you're engaged,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.120]   you still want to buy the newest iPhones
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.160]   and computers and cars.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.200]   I would say it probably should be CPI plus X
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.920]   and plus X could be something like
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.240]   average per capita consumption growth,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.520]   which is maybe one and a half percent.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.400]   Because if you don't do that,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.460]   you don't adjust your spending
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.400]   the same way everybody else around you,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.240]   your relatives, your neighbors, your friends,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.120]   would adjust their spending, right?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.040]   Because the CPI prices,
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.260]   well, the phone that you would have bought last year,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.600]   well, the price for that goes down a lot this year,
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.640]   but I'm no longer buying the phone from a year ago
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   or two years ago.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.680]   I no longer, we no longer buy
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.520]   black and white television sets, right?
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.920]   Or these boxy sets, right?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.800]   We buy, so a lot of the CPI,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.240]   the reason why the CPI is actually a little bit depressed
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.600]   has been in some of these technological goods
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.640]   are becoming cheaper,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.840]   but they're becoming cheaper
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.640]   because of quality adjustments, right?
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.760]   So the actual out-the-store price
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.040]   is not going down as much as the CPI would suggest.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.540]   So I would personally be a little bit afraid
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.280]   of doing only CPI adjustment, at least at the beginning,
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   but then I agree, obviously later in retirement,
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.440]   a lot of people slow down.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.120]   And the way I would model this in my simulation sheet,
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.440]   there's actually one parameter
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.240]   where you can set a scaling parameter.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.860]   And the scaling means I can set this to one at the beginning
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.600]   and then I can increase by,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.080]   say, if I want to do CPI plus 1%,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.080]   I can let this grow by 1%.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.400]   So it would model spending increases above inflation.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.840]   And then later on, when that U shape, that smile happens,
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.360]   then I will take this down again and take it up again later
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.160]   when I'm maybe 85 or 90 years old.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.000]   And I mean, usually what happens is that
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.440]   if you're an early retiree and you're looking at,
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.000]   well, what is the potential for nursing home expenses
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.840]   later in retirement?
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.900]   It will have a relatively small impact
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.500]   on my initial withdrawal rate.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   But I can tell you that doing anything like the CPI plus X,
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   it will take down my initial withdrawal rate for sure.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.500]   Because even though it's a very slow creep in your expenses,
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.260]   it definitely lowers your safe withdrawal rate.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.540]   And that's one of the things that we should worry about.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.540]   Can we really afford to do only CPI plus zero?
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.360]   Do we have to do CPI plus X?
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.000]   And if you go way above CPI adjustments,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.080]   it might mean that, especially for early retirees,
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.700]   you need to be more cautious and conservative there.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.640]   - Can everybody hear me with this mic all right?
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.840]   Okay, good.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.560]   Probably what I'm gonna say is gonna echo
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.520]   what my colleagues have said earlier.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.340]   But one thing I learned in my research over years
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.540]   is that until I've run the numbers,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.020]   I'm better not off announcing any conclusions
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.220]   because this field constantly surprises me.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.180]   There are a lot of counterintuitive results
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.980]   that come out of the research.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.500]   If your expenses, and I haven't modeled an expense
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.140]   where you start high, drop and come up,
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.440]   which is called a smile.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.940]   And I guess the first question I ask is,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.560]   your retirement kind of a Mona Lisa smile
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.880]   or is it really a big laugh?
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.440]   Yeah, we're gonna drop sharply.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.880]   My instinctive reaction is to expect
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.440]   that the most important part of retirement
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.120]   are the first 10 years, my research indicated.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.240]   What happens there to inflation, to your expenditures,
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.280]   to your withdrawals, to market returns,
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.620]   pretty much sets the pattern for the rest of retirement.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.440]   So if you go into retirement
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.860]   and you're reducing expenses initially,
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.940]   I would expect it would have a favorable effect
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.560]   upon your initial withdrawal rate.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.040]   So I would expect that if you use the COLA method,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   you were gonna come out with 5%,
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.000]   you might have significantly more
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.960]   if you were gonna follow some kind of a smile
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.680]   depending upon your sense of humor.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.560]   - Christine, in your research,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.480]   you mentioned we can go from 4% to 5%
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.280]   if we assume a decrease in spending.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   Are you also assuming an increase at the end as well,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.440]   an increase in spending?
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.280]   - So we did, we looked at the EBRI research
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.960]   and I believe it did have some elevation,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.480]   but after talking to David,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.120]   I think we did not incorporate
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.680]   the full effects that he has demonstrated
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.880]   with his smile research.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.880]   So because it's just not something that happens to everyone,
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.840]   not everyone is hit with those big outlays later in life.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.960]   - Got it, it's those outliers.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.600]   So we have a related question also from Boatlet's Facebook.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.640]   This one is from Anthony.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   And he asks about how sustainable distributions
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.960]   in retirement change if you've got no social security income
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.040]   and then that social security income kicks on.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.960]   How does that impact your distribution rate?
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.920]   - Yeah, I'm really, I have like a dead spot here.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.080]   If you could just repeat that for me.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.960]   - How does social security income,
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.640]   how does social security income?
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.960]   - Oh, okay, how does that fit in?
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.840]   Yeah, I can start that.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.760]   - I ignore it completely.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.800]   Sorry about that.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.200]   The folk, obviously if you're doing
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.080]   a complete financial planning analysis
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.280]   for an individual for retirement, critical portion.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   But my whole job is, I think is,
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.880]   from the beginning has been trying to maximize
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.800]   what you get out of your portfolio,
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.560]   irrespective of what other income you have,
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.280]   whether it be social security, annuity,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.080]   or Pinterest, so forth.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.440]   I like to say, think of your portfolio as a cow
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.920]   that you bought at retirement and you want to get milk
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.880]   from that cow for your whole retirement.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.440]   You want to know as much as you can
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.040]   about the maintenance and care and the feed
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.680]   and the housing of that cow.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.400]   So you get the most milk and you want to also know
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.720]   how much milk you can safely get out of that cow
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.920]   without killing it, at least not so soon.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.240]   So that's kind of a weird analogy I know,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.600]   but I think if you think of it like that,
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.240]   that's what I do and I don't ignore
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   about all the other animals in the barnyard,
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.960]   like the goats and the sheep and everything else.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.480]   I'm just focusing on the cow.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.640]   - Yeah, so I mean, we have to distinguish sometimes
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.480]   traditional versus early retirees, right?
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.840]   Traditional retirees often retire
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.320]   and then claim social security at the same time.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.680]   So you basically, many people just do a separate analysis,
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   where they say, well, I have my social security income
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.560]   and then I take my portfolio and then I apply
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.040]   the 4% rule and then I run with that.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.680]   Obviously, depending on the size of your social security,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.160]   you could also say, well, maybe social security
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.320]   already covers all of your mandatory expenses,
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.560]   so you can take some more chances with your portfolio.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.200]   So in that sense, social security impacts
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.560]   your safe withdrawal rate analysis.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.720]   For us early retirees, obviously,
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.120]   we want to factor in social security.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.400]   I mean, some people say, well, I ignore it, right?
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.520]   And then they ignore it and then they say,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.560]   well, first of all, maybe the government
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.440]   is gonna default on it.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.000]   I don't think the government will default on it.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.600]   They might do a little bit of a haircut,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.320]   there's some kind of a benefit formula changes.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.000]   It's possible, but maybe you give it a small haircut.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.480]   But even if you give it a small haircut,
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.680]   so imagine that you know that 20 years into your retirement,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.960]   you receive social security benefits
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.880]   that are worth 2% annually withdrawal rate,
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.280]   compared to today's portfolio.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.200]   Well, obviously you can raise your safe withdrawal rate
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.520]   today by 2%, has to be a little bit less than 2%,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.400]   but I think it should not be zero, right?
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.840]   It has to be more than 2%.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.560]   And of course, by how much you can raise
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.800]   your today initial withdrawal,
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.000]   and then you would take it down
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.400]   by as much as you get social security later.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.320]   So that is a numerical and quantitative exercise.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.960]   You have to put this into my toolkit
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.920]   and then see what it is.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.240]   It could be that it's maybe half of it,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.520]   and you can already use half of it,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.320]   as long as later on in retirement,
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.800]   you reduce your withdrawals.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.840]   So you think of that as a multi-stage retirement.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.520]   But instead of thinking of that as some kind of a bucket
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.280]   and a mental accounting thing
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.800]   where you do everything separately,
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   I think it should be done as one unified, holistic exercise,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.760]   and that's the clean and proper
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.360]   and mathematically optimal way.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.160]   And yeah, I mean, you should factor in social security.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.760]   Don't discount it.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.480]   - I would also just say that for our 2024 research,
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.000]   that is one of the real world scenarios
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.760]   that we're modeling out where someone delays social security.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.160]   And so that necessitates higher withdrawals earlier on.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.120]   And so we're examining the impact
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.800]   on what starting withdrawals would look like
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.960]   in that scenario and how that affects later withdrawals.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.760]   And John, in response to your previous question
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.440]   about how we modeled in long-term care,
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.160]   I'm recalling that the EBRI research that we used
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.240]   did not actually show that upward trend
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.960]   on the right-hand side of the smile.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.600]   And so it was a little bit in conflict
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.560]   with David Blanchett's research that showed the smile.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.280]   I remember we kind of looked at it and said,
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.600]   wait, it's not even really going up,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.960]   even factoring in the fact that some retirees
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.520]   have high long-term care costs.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.520]   - So use 5% only if you're lucky.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.960]   Okay.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.400]   All right, we've got a couple of questions
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   comparing Carsten's and Bill's sustainable distribution rates.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.680]   Carsten claims 4% is too high.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.760]   Bill claims you can go higher than 4%.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.080]   Discuss.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.680]   (all laughing)
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.520]   - Again, it depends on your personal parameters, right?
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.160]   And it also depends on what our asset valuations right now.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.760]   So we're doing this conference in September, 2024.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.720]   So we'll be reminded the CAPE is at 36.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.040]   Whether it's trailing earnings or forward-looking earnings,
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.600]   they are maybe not all-time highs,
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.080]   but very close to all-time highs.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.400]   So I would probably be a little bit more cautious.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.680]   But as I said earlier, right,
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.080]   if you look at not the generic safe withdrawal rate exercise,
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.880]   but you look at actual volunteers,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.080]   actual people that do their math,
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.640]   say somebody who retires in their late 40s, early 50s,
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.960]   and social security isn't too far away, right?
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.360]   You should take that into account.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.480]   Very quickly, you're way above 4%,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.080]   even at the market peaks, right?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   And absolutely, you can squeeze out a little bit more
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.720]   if you factor that in.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.240]   And by the way, I'm already prepared
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.280]   for what Bill is gonna say.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.840]   I mean, maybe you can squeeze out a little bit more
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.760]   with more diversification.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.720]   We've heard a lot about small-cap value investing.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.600]   In historical simulations, absolutely,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.640]   you can show that small-cap value buyers
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.080]   would have raised your safe withdrawal rate.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.760]   I personally, I'm a little bit of a skeptic,
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.360]   so I'm in the Rick Ferry camp and Jim Dolly,
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.960]   because I would be afraid.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.680]   I wouldn't tie my retirement
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   to the small-cap value buyers picking up again
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.840]   right around the time I'm retiring.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.280]   And what if it doesn't?
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.400]   What if it deflates again?
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.880]   I would probably be...
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.440]   So if you talk about an alpha source, right?
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.680]   Somebody could come up with some alpha source
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.280]   that increases my retirement spending.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.680]   I want that alpha source to be relatively reliable
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.040]   over every single market cycle.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.840]   So I don't have the luxury of saying,
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.120]   "Oh, yeah, I mean, every once in a while,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.840]   "we have some 30-year drought periods,
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.320]   "but then it really takes off."
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.880]   Well, after 30 years, you might be dead or bankrupt.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.280]   So, but anyways, I'll let Bill weigh in on that one.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.120]   So how do you want to raise that?
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.160]   - Okay, I want to be sure I answer the right question.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.040]   So you're asking, what about,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.240]   what specifically were you asking?
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.600]   - So I'm the more conservative guy,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.360]   and you say with the right planning,
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.400]   you can increase your safe withdrawal rate
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.360]   to 5% plus. - So that's question basically.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.920]   Yeah, there are, I mentioned in previous sessions,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.080]   there are factors.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.360]   I've identified four factors,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.320]   which I call free lunches in retirement investing.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.960]   Some of them are not so surprising.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.920]   The top list is diversification.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.960]   Every capable investor does that.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.600]   You don't put all your money in Nvidia stock
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.160]   and ride it till the end of your life.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.320]   You know, you have other investments.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   Although that would not have been too bad
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.600]   for the last couple of years, I got to admit.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.200]   Another one is rebalancing your account.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.680]   That can add a significant amount to your,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.560]   and you need to do that to get to the 5% level.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.240]   Another consideration is to
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.160]   slightly tilt your portfolio
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.560]   towards higher returning assets.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.120]   Don't do this in an excessive way.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.160]   For example, I start with a portfolio
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.640]   with five asset classes, each have 11%.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.880]   And I decide I'm gonna put maybe 14% in the micro caps
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.440]   and the small cap stocks,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.160]   which have quite a bit higher returns over the long term
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.320]   than some of the other asset classes.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.520]   That'll give you a significant bump
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.760]   to your, like a quarter of a percent.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.880]   And all these factors, when you put them in, add up.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.080]   And historically, they've been proven
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.520]   really not to generate any additional risk
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.720]   over and above what you would normally take.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.840]   So I say, if food's on the table, let's eat it.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.360]   You know, enjoy the meal.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:47.560]   - So relatedly, we've got S&P 500, we've got bonds.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.360]   What are the other asset classes that we are assuming
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.560]   is in the portfolios when you guys
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.560]   are calculating your distribution rates?
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.800]   - Now I have to admit, I didn't hear that right.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.520]   Could you explain it to me, Bill?
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.080]   - I can repeat.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.840]   So what other asset classes are you using
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.920]   in your forecast of safe withdrawal rates?
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.680]   - Right, so in my toolkit,
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.720]   I have U.S. stocks, international stocks.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.800]   So on U.S. fixed income, I have short-term,
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.160]   something like three-month T-bill,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.760]   10-year bonds, 30-year bonds.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.720]   And I have gold and commodities.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.080]   And I have the two pharma-French factors,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.640]   are the value and size factor.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.240]   And you can play around with that.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   And for me personally, I think that you can
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.520]   pretty much span everything by just doing
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.360]   the 10-year treasury versus U.S. stocks
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.360]   and play around with the allocation.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.720]   And what I found is that portfolio 75% S&P 500
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.520]   and 25% intermediate bonds,
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.360]   so something like the IEF, I believe.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.720]   So seven to 10 years ETF.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.400]   That would hedge against kind of everything
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.880]   that the market throws at you,
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.520]   whether it's a demand shock recession
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.600]   like the Great Depression in 1929 to the 1930s,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.360]   or this long extended event between the 1960s and 1982
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.760]   with the sluggish market,
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.200]   and then very inflationary episode
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.440]   with poor bond returns
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.040]   and also modestly poor equity returns.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.240]   So everything that the market throws at you,
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.800]   you can capture with that
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.680]   and get a halfway decent safe withdrawal rate.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.000]   And now you can obviously micro manage this
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.360]   and find the absolute best allocation
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.840]   that covers all the different angles.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.120]   Sounds like overfitting to me.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.560]   So if I keep it relatively simple,
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.400]   I mean, at least I know going forward,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.080]   we have an equity premium
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.400]   that's going to pay generously, I hope.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   We have a bond term premium
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   that pays you a little bit more than cash.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.960]   There's a little bit of diversification
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.160]   between stocks and bonds,
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.960]   so it's not going to totally wipe out your portfolio
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.760]   in the next sequence of return event.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.360]   So I'm relatively comfortable doing the 75/25.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.880]   I'm really hesitant to find anything
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.440]   that is super optimized
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.280]   where I throw in all sorts of other factors
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.960]   like small cap and value
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.800]   and small cap value and energy and gold.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.280]   Actually, gold at the margin,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.160]   at least would have performed quite well.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.800]   Of course, always with the caveat
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.960]   that in this country,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.880]   we weren't even allowed to hold gold,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.240]   but I mean, you can throw the return series
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   at the simulations, obviously,
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.320]   with a little bit of the asterisks
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.800]   that actually gold would have,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.000]   I mean, there's small allocation,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   something like 5% to 10%
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.440]   would have done a pretty good job
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.200]   at hedging quite intriguingly
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.520]   both deflationary and inflationary recessions.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.320]   But again, I don't want to stress that too much
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.600]   and I'm not doing it myself.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.040]   I kind of did the math.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.240]   If I look at my portfolio,
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.080]   if I wanted to put 10% into gold,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.440]   I mean, that's some,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.400]   I don't think I would be comfortable
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.200]   moving that into gold.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.280]   So that's why I want to do something
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.920]   very bare bones, nothing overfitted.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.320]   And if it's not overfitted,
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.920]   I'm more confident that it actually works
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.040]   going forward and out of sample.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:30.920]   - Our asset allocation, we do vary.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.840]   So we look at all different equity bond allocations
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.240]   when we do the research.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.520]   At an intra-asset class level,
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.720]   we hold those steady.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.640]   We don't vary them.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.960]   Our main thing that we are looking at
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.680]   is the core asset classes
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.840]   and how varying those exposures
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.400]   change up the safe withdrawal rate.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   The kind of stunning takeaway
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.080]   for our base case last year was,
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.000]   so we came up with this 4% safe withdrawal percentage,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.920]   but it corresponded with a portfolio
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.720]   with just 20% to 40% equity.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.200]   And I was like, go back.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.440]   Let's do that again because that doesn't make sense.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.520]   But really what it is,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.600]   is with what we're asking the simulator
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.000]   to provide for us is,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.960]   we're saying we want this sort of fixed paycheck,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.560]   unwavering in retirement.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.800]   And so given where yields were last year
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.720]   when we ran the simulations,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.880]   it basically says back to us,
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.240]   okay, if that's what you want,
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.760]   if you never want to waver
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.560]   how much you take from the portfolio,
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.760]   you just want the same real amount,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.440]   go for the fixed income today.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.880]   It was basically saying let's lock that down
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.240]   because of the much higher standard deviation with equities.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.840]   So that was kind of an interesting takeaway.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.440]   So the sort of secondary takeaway
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   is that if you are willing to vary your withdrawals,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.120]   you can take a higher starting withdrawal, as I said,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.720]   and that tends, the highest safe withdrawal
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   with a dynamic strategy tends to correspond
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.280]   with a higher equity allocation.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.040]   So just some interesting findings
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.240]   in our most recent research.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.320]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.600]   Which brings me to a related question.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.040]   You mentioned that optimal mix,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.520]   at least for this year's study,
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.000]   being between 20 and 40% bonds
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.960]   because you make an assumption of high yields
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.080]   from that bond portfolio.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.000]   Carson, Bill, tell us about the optimal stock to bond mix
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.240]   if you want to get the highest distribution rate
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.320]   from your portfolio.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.520]   - Yeah, so as I said,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.520]   I think 75/25 seems to be a pretty good mix.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.200]   If you go too far on the bond side,
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.920]   it helps you during the Great Depression,
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.360]   but then it totally kills you during the 1970s and '80s,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.920]   and then vice versa.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.600]   If you're too aggressive on stocks,
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.320]   it's going to really kill you during the Great Depression.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.720]   And then, so you almost want to look at what's the,
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.160]   you look at the minimum between the two episodes,
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   and then you maximize the,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.880]   and again, this sounds a little bit like,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.280]   you know, maybe overfitting, sausage making.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.040]   You don't, you almost lose your appetite
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.880]   when you see sometimes how sausage is made
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.040]   and how statistics are made,
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.760]   and then also how economic forecasts are made
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.360]   and how a safe withdrawal rate simulations are made.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.880]   Sometimes you don't want to know the details,
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.000]   but I mean, this is how I came to the 25/75, right?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.760]   You look at what does the best, more robust,
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.920]   that gives you a hedge against both
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.880]   a deflationary recession and an inflationary recession.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.240]   Now, as I said before,
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.560]   you can play a little bit more with,
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.960]   maybe we don't want to have all bonds that have duration,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.560]   right, maybe we have a little bit more fixed income,
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.400]   but it's in cash,
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.280]   so something like three month T-bills.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.600]   You could play around with that too,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.000]   but if I'm just tied to the stock versus bond,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.600]   I found that the 75/25 seems to be pretty good.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.360]   And then there's always this,
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.280]   I'm glad Clifford Esners is not here,
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   so he would always point out,
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.920]   well, why don't you just take the tangency portfolio
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.880]   and lever that up?
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.640]   Yeah, I mean, if you're very financially savvy,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.480]   you can do that,
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.080]   but the average retail investor
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.720]   wouldn't be able to do that.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.840]   So if you are bound to a portfolio without leverage
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.040]   and only stocks and bonds,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.920]   I would propose 75/25.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.600]   - Yeah, do you want me to?
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.720]   Yeah, my research indicates that
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   between about 46% equities and about 70% equities,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.080]   it doesn't make too much difference what you choose.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.280]   You're gonna have approximately the same withdrawal rate.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.960]   You get outside of that range,
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.160]   like 75%, I'd like to see your numbers.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.000]   I really haven't.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.080]   I'd probably learn a lot what you're saying,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.360]   but 75% is a slight penalty, but it's not a lot.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.760]   So I can't disagree strongly with what you're saying.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.000]   I do wanna make one point.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.200]   I think that retirees,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.000]   my research is based on a buy and hold strategy.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.680]   That area assumes that.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.040]   That's because it's very difficult to analyze
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.440]   anything that isn't buy and hold.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.400]   But I'm of the firm of opinion that retirees,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.680]   particularly early in their retirement,
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.520]   the first 10 years,
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.280]   should not be buy and hold investors necessarily.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.720]   I think they should be more risk managers.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.400]   I think their primary concern
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.920]   will be preserving their nest egg
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.280]   from a huge bear market like we had in 2008,
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.280]   where people saw they lost 30, 35% of their portfolio.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.440]   It came back eventually
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.880]   because of very aggressive actions by the Fed.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.800]   But I just wanna express the opinion,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.960]   and I know there's a lot of people who disagree with me.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   I don't wanna suggest that you use market timing,
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.680]   which is trying to get the exact bottom to sell,
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.320]   to buy an exact top to sell.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.920]   I don't think anyone in God's creation
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.280]   can do that reliably.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.400]   But I think there are third-party services
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.840]   that offer advice in risk management,
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.080]   where as risk increases in the stock market,
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.560]   you reduce your allocation.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.000]   And as more favorable conditions arise,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.480]   you increase your allocation.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.840]   I just think, to me,
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.240]   that makes sense to preserve capital
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.360]   and not expose yourself to something
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.600]   we haven't seen before.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.320]   Who knows what the next bear market will look like?
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:43.120]   - Vogel has probably what caution at market time,
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.240]   but I think I agree with you that, for example,
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.360]   something like a reverse glide path in retirement,
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.600]   where you have, and so people call it differently,
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.720]   reverse glide path, or a bond tent,
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.480]   which the bond tent is the two parts,
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.720]   the two legs of the glide path into retirement,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.760]   and then during retirement, you start shifting up again.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.320]   So that means you want to have the maximum bond exposure
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.760]   at the time of your retirement,
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.560]   and then almost as a hedge against sequence of return,
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.240]   which then you shift back into equities.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   And do you know why?
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.440]   Bill Bernstein's chart, did you see that one?
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.480]   But the negative correlation in stock returns,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.120]   not year-to-year, not month-to-month, not day-to-day,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.560]   but over larger timeframes,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.280]   over 10 years, 15 years, 30 years,
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.480]   if you have bad luck in your first 10 to 15 years,
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.560]   stock returns are then going to be much higher
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.720]   over the next 15 years, at least on average.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.920]   And well, guess what?
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   That's exactly where your glide path ends,
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.240]   and then you have higher equity allocation
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.600]   right when equities turn around again.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.640]   So that's where that intuition comes from.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.000]   And then there's actually multiple ways of justifying that.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.080]   One is there's market history,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.080]   but even with completely basically Monte Carlo returns,
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.360]   where you don't have any kind of mean reversion
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.120]   or negative serial correlation,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.840]   is what it's called in statistics,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.920]   even with completely random Monte Carlo draws
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.360]   from a normal distribution,
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.440]   you still have this impact.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.640]   And it has to do with when you go into retirement,
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.280]   you're phasing out your,
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.760]   when you go into your last few years of allocation,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.560]   you want to go lower risk.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.360]   And then once you're in retirement,
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.960]   so think of your retirement savings
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.640]   as almost like an implicit bond allocation,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.000]   and you phase this out.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.280]   To overcome that, you do the glide path into retirement.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.920]   And then when you're in retirement,
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.360]   think of your withdrawals
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.720]   as an implicit negative bond allocation, right?
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.960]   Because you're taking money out.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.360]   It's almost like a bond, like a fixed income flow.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.800]   I mean, it's literally fixed withdrawals.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.360]   So I think of that as negative bond allocation.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.680]   And as you roll this out and say you,
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.760]   and then as a bequest motive,
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.360]   you have, well, whatever you have left over,
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.000]   you leave to your kids and you want to maximize that.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.560]   And as you phase out your withdrawal,
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.960]   so that's the opposite effect.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.040]   And now you go back into equities again,
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.600]   because you have less of this negative bond allocation.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.960]   So this glide path, bond tend and reverse glide path,
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.880]   it's very intuitive,
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.400]   even though target date funds do the opposite.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:23.280]   And this hasn't really reached the target date industry.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.960]   And there might be some legal reasons
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.840]   why they can't do it,
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.480]   but it's actually mathematically.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.200]   And then from a financial history point of view,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.360]   there are rationales that you want to have
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.480]   this reverse glide path in retirement.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.240]   - And Karsten, is that something you've looked at
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.360]   in your research, a bond tenant,
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.880]   has that increased sustainable distribution rates?
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.360]   - But then again, don't get too delusional, right?
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.920]   I mean, it's not like if you're bare bones,
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.480]   safe withdrawal rate is 3.5%.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.760]   It's not like with that reverse glide path,
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.240]   you can suddenly raise that to 4% or 4.5%.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.040]   And we are talking about something like 20 basis points,
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.640]   which is huge, right?
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.840]   Because 20 basis points,
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.560]   that could be something like 6, 7% of your retirement budget.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.080]   I mean, at least in historical simulations,
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.720]   you have a little bit of a higher initial withdrawal rate
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.440]   if you do this bond tent business.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.320]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.480]   - Super.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.040]   Bill, we've got a follow-up question for you.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.680]   What is the fourth free lunch, only three were mentioned?
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.240]   - Yeah, that was the fourth free lunch, the glide path.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.720]   Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.840]   - All right.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.560]   Okay, at least two speakers mentioned
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.640]   that there is no safe fixed withdrawal rates
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.760]   and that you will have to adjust withdrawals
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.400]   as markets adjust.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.520]   Do you agree or disagree?
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.560]   - Well, I don't know that you have to,
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.120]   but our research would point to the value of doing so,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.880]   that if you are willing to make, say annual,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.200]   at least an assessment,
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.920]   you might not always have to do a course correction,
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.280]   but if you're willing to check in annually,
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.120]   I think that's a good practice.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.400]   And potentially you will have to take haircuts
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.640]   now and again, but you may be able to take raises as well,
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.000]   depending on what sort of dynamic spending system you use.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:21.960]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.680]   So for example, this is probably another way
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.720]   in which your research is misunderstood,
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.480]   that they think that a fixed withdrawal rate
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.320]   or a fixed withdrawal amount CPI adjust,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.560]   it means that this is a set it and forget it kind of deal.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.160]   And of course you want to check
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.000]   your financial plan occasionally.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.160]   And I always view it this way.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.400]   I mean, what if every year you re-retire, right?
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.280]   I mean, you look at your portfolio
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.080]   and you do another safe withdrawal rate analysis
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.600]   and you look at, of course,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.040]   what would be really dangerous
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.480]   and probably way too conservative
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.880]   is what if your portfolio is down,
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.960]   are you going to re-retire with this lower portfolio
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   again at the 4% rule?
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.200]   Probably not, because now suddenly your withdrawals
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.800]   are just going to be as volatile as your portfolio.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.160]   So you can probably do some kind of an adjustment.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.480]   And there's even an economic and financial rational, right?
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.080]   Because if the stock market is down,
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.200]   now probably the CAPE ratio is down too, right?
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.800]   So your portfolio may be down,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.120]   but maybe now you can increase
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.520]   your safe withdrawal rate a little bit.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.720]   Not by as much to completely undo the effect
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.400]   from your portfolio drop, but at least partially.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.960]   And yeah, so I think it is absolutely,
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.800]   it's the financially and I think it's also
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.760]   the mathematically sound thing to do
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.800]   to reassess your retirement plan.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.480]   And there's a whole, I studied economics
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.560]   and you talk a lot about dynamic optimization problems.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.920]   There's a whole, it's called the Bellman principle
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.240]   of optimality that you, every optimal plan
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.840]   has to be optimal at every possible stage in the future.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:59.320]   So, and yeah, absolutely, you should revisit
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.560]   what your retirement plan looks like every,
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.440]   maybe not every month, but every year.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.960]   Check if you're still on plan.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.520]   And for example, I did this, right?
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.040]   I mean, I went through one correction in 2018,
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.960]   right out of the gates, a bear market in 2020
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.280]   and another bear market in 2022.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.960]   And so every time I checked, well, yeah,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.600]   I mean, portfolio is slightly down about my spending.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.960]   Is that still in line with where it should be?
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.920]   And then of course you also look at market valuations.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.440]   Yeah, portfolio is down,
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.040]   but equity valuations are much better.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.280]   And I always make this case.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.560]   If the stock market is already down by 30%,
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.360]   I don't have to target again a 4% rate
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.360]   because that's calibrated to the worst case scenario
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.120]   of the 1929 bear market.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.080]   It's not like we are going to tag on another 80% drop
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.520]   from that 30% drop already.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.760]   So take into account that, well,
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.280]   maybe don't compare today's safe withdrawal.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.480]   If your portfolio is down,
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.120]   don't compare today's withdrawal rate
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.320]   to the peak before the 1929 bear market.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.840]   But well, 1929 minus also 30 or 40%,
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.000]   where was the portfolio then?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.200]   And then check what would have been
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.440]   the safe withdrawal rate in that month,
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.840]   far away from that peak.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.640]   So, and I mean, you definitely keep your sanity
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.480]   if you do that.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.000]   Now, if you recalibrate every time with a 4% draw,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.760]   that might become stressful, right?
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.720]   So you want to do it, you want to reassess,
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.440]   but reassess it in a sane way
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.840]   and don't get too conservative that way.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   - Yeah, can I go next?
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.680]   Okay.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.960]   Three years ago, I developed what I call a two-factor model
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   where to develop the safe withdrawal rate
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.440]   for an individual.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.640]   I look at current inflation rate, whatever the regime,
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.200]   what we think it'll be in the next five years,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.040]   and look at the valuations of the stock market
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   using that Shiller-Kate cyclically adjusted PE ratio.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.480]   And I found out that those two factors used together
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.240]   have about an 85% correlation
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.920]   with what safe withdrawal rates were in the past.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.080]   Well, that means about 15% of the time,
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   it's going to give you the wrong answer.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.640]   Half of that time, about 7.5%,
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.440]   the withdrawal rate that emerges from that process
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.280]   is going to be too low.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.320]   An example would be, let's say in the mid to late 80s,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.840]   we would have forecasted a much lower withdrawal rate
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.160]   than was actually possible.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.440]   And what happened, of course,
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.240]   is that from the mid to late 80s,
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.560]   which had fairly normal stock market valuations,
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.560]   valuations more than doubled into the 2000 dot-com bubble.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.200]   So investors had, in their early retirement,
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.000]   an enormous tailwind which ballooned their portfolios
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.840]   beyond anyone could expect.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.080]   And of course, since it happened early in retirement,
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.360]   it was maximum benefit.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.000]   There are other cases where it'll give you the wrong answer,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.280]   it'll give you the answer that's too high.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.520]   So it's essential that an investment,
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.000]   what I call just not a withdrawal rate,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.320]   it's an entire plan,
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.560]   and it's a retirement withdrawal plan,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.280]   has to be monitored just like any plan,
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.760]   whether it be investment plan or estate plan,
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.200]   insurance plan,
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.240]   and you have to be prepared to recognize
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.240]   when that plan has deviated in a dangerous way
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.320]   that it might actually cause a downfall of the plan
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.880]   and recognize what steps you have to take.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.120]   And very briefly,
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.840]   if you run into an unexpectedly deep bear market
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.080]   early in retirement,
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.160]   probably your best strategy is do nothing
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.800]   because the market will probably recover from there.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.160]   That's the one good thing about bear markets,
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.560]   they don't last forever.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.040]   You know, they're gone and they recover.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.280]   However, if you encounter a period of extended,
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.400]   unexpected high inflation,
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.440]   get ready to run for the hills, folks.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.600]   You're gonna have to do something to you actively
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.280]   to manage your withdrawal rate
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.000]   because that is a very bad danger
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.520]   because you're gonna elevate your withdrawal rates
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.640]   and it's gonna continue.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.440]   You're stuck with those high dollar withdrawals
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.520]   for the rest of retirement.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.160]   There is no respite.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.320]   So, and there are other variations of it,
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.920]   but that's my overall view of take-up things.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.640]   - Wonderful, thank you.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.120]   Well, folks, that is gonna be it for our panel.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.600]   Let's give them a round of applause.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.560]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.400]   - Good work. - Thank you.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.240]   - Enjoyed it.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.880]   you
