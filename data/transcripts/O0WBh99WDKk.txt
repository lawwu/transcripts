[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, when it comes to temptations to sexual sin,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Jesus said, "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off."
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   He also says that there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   In reading these texts together, a listener writes in to ask if Jesus is
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   commending surgical or chemical castration as a winning strategy for men
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   in the war against lust. No question is off limits for the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   but you all know that by now. Here's the email from an anonymous man.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm a man who struggles greatly with pornography use.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Even though I've come to know God and try to fight these temptations with Scripture,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I cannot seem to win over my sexual immorality."
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Jesus said, "For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Let the one who is able to receive this, receive it."
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Matthew 19, 12.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   "I want to glorify God and I'm willing to sacrifice everything I have to be with Him."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Jesus also said, "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands and to go to hell,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   to the unquenchable fire." Mark 9, 43.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So my question, Pastor John, for you is this.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Is surgical or chemical castration a viable option for me?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   In Matthew 19, 9, Jesus limits remarriage after divorce so narrowly
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   that in verse 10, the disciples, as it were, throw up their hands and say,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   "Well, if such is the case of a man with his wife, then it's better not to marry."
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   In other words, if there's no back door to marriage, better not to walk through the front door.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And to this, Jesus responds by saying that not everyone can fulfill his radical view of covenant keeping in marriage.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   He says in verse 11, "Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given."
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   In other words, marrying and staying married under these conditions of absolute faithfulness
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   is a gift of God and not everybody receives it.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And then he describes three situations in which a man may be sexually pure,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   sexually continent, while not receiving the gift of marriage.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Verse 12, it says, "One, for there are eunuchs who have been so from birth,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and two, there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and three, there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Let the one who is able to receive this receive it."
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   In other words, there are four possible paths of faithfulness.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   First, to receive Jesus' radical teachings and live in a marriage according to those teachings.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Second, you can be born with a physical inability that prevents sexual relations.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Three, you may be prevented in some way by other people from having the ability for sexual relations.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And four, you may make a choice that would prevent sexual relations outside of marriage.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Now, the man who sent us this question is asking whether this fourth option,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   which Jesus describes as making oneself a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   is in fact a legitimizing of physical or chemical castration.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I think we need to respond at several levels, maybe four.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   First, even if Jesus meant this literally, physically literally, castration literally,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Even if he meant that literally, that's not the same as saying you may or you should,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   nor is it a prohibition that you can't use physical means to dampen or remove your sexual drive.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So that's the first observation. It's not a mandate, and it's not a prohibition.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Second, Jesus does say in relation to sexual sin, and our questioner pointed this out,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   if your right hand causes you to sin, I mean, if your right eye, let's use eye, he does say hand,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell, Matthew 5:29.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But isn't it remarkable that he only refers to the right eye,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   which would leave the left eye perfectly free to continue with lust?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Now, this has led most interpreters to think, and I agree with them,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   that Jesus is not saying that gouging out your right eye is a good remedy for lust.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   A literal taking a screwdriver and poking it in your eye is not a good remedy for lust. It isn't.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   The left eye will pick up right where the right eye left off.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   This is a call to the most serious spiritual battle of mortification, but probably not self-mutilation,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   since that, in this case, wouldn't do any good.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   But the seriousness is no less, because he says heaven and hell hang in the balance.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   That's the second observation.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Third, this suggests to me that probably making oneself a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   refers to a radical call to chaste celibacy, like Paul in 1 Corinthians 7, rather than physical castration.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Fourth, finally, however, I don't want to rule out the legitimacy of taking physical steps
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   to dampen one's sexual drive if the aim is spiritual victory over sin.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   We do this. All of us do this, at least if we're smart and if we're obedient, we do this.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   We do this with other physical temptations.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We get sleep to dampen the bent toward the sin of irritability.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   We jogâ€”I jog to dampen my bent toward the sin of despondency.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I take walks in the beautiful October weather in Minnesota,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and look at these gold and yellow trees to replace inward-oriented moroseness with outward-oriented joy.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We drink a cup of coffee in the morning to make us more alert and effective in our working.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So there's a principle here that he's on to that's not wrong,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   namely taking physical steps to mute the power of lust or of whatever impulse it is that is leading us into sin.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But I would beware of procedures that have permanent and unknown personal effects.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   That's good. And if you've listened to this podcast for some time,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   you know this twofold attack on personal sin comes up a lot.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   We cultivate the inner heart. We feed the spiritual affections.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And we also battle and resist in the outer context of life with habits and boundaries and accountability.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And this twofold approach emerges all the time in the ethical questions.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's a very important paradigm to live by,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   and you'll hear it come up in this podcast quite a bit because of how important it is.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Well, thanks for listening and supporting this podcast.

[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Well, in the end times, the Bible tells us that people will be lovers of self,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   lovers of selfies, lovers of selfie sticks.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I'm reading into that a little bit, but when and how does our social media manifest our corrupt self-love?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   That's the question on Monday.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We'll see you on the other side of the weekend.
