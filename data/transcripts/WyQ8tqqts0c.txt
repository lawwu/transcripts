[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Well, fantasy sports gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States and a
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.880]   young man, a listener to the podcast who wishes to remain anonymous wrote specifically to
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.000]   ask about fantasy football gambling.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.360]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.360]   Thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.480]   I'm a big sports fan and I absolutely love playing fantasy football as a hobby.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.120]   I started out playing one free season in an online league, but as of late, I've been playing
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.240]   daily fantasy sports games on DraftKings and FanDuel, a form of gambling which costs money
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.620]   in entry fees.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.880]   The bets I place are rather modest at $20 to $50 per week.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.720]   I have not found a lot of Christian resources on the topic.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   Pastor John, is modest online sports gambling like this sinful?"
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.080]   Yes.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.120]   I think online gambling in general, little or big, is sinful, whether you call it modest
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.880]   or exorbitant.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:06.280]   And I've got seven reasons at least that I would encourage this young man to rethink
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.760]   the way he spends his time and his money as a Christian.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.240]   And it's the cumulative effect of these seven observations that caused me to say that what
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.960]   he's doing is sinful.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:32.000]   But of course, he will need to judge according to the Scriptures and his conscience, because
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.760]   my words don't make something sinful.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.880]   God's words make something sinful.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.760]   So here are my reasons I would like to see him rethink his ways and devote his life to
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.480]   something vastly more important and use his money differently.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.760]   Number one, I would remind our young friend that he has one single life to live on this
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.920]   earth for the glory of Christ, and then comes eternity.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760]   He never gets a redo.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.840]   Every day is invested well or is lost forever.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.960]   Every breath you take, every minute of life you have is a free gift of God and a trust,
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.400]   a stewardship, which God says should be lived for his glory, for the magnifying of his Son.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.760]   Innocent games can be helpful.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.480]   They can be a helpful refreshment to the mind.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.600]   They can be a sweetening for relationships, especially with kids, I would say.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.200]   It can be a taste of heaven and fellowship.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.880]   But in themselves, in a fallen, needy, miserable, tragic, dying, hell-bent world like ours,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.040]   they have very little significance.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.760]   Our friend calls himself a big sports fan.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.720]   He says he absolutely loves fantasy football.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.120]   He speaks of multiple avenues of playing.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.960]   He talks about putting money on the line.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:22.120]   I would say all this time, all this intensity, all this money show things are out of proportion
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.400]   in his life.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.680]   This to me looks like a tragic waste of a precious, God-given, gifted life.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.320]   Number two, I would say that the degree to which a person is absorbed in an unreal world,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:48.040]   to that degree, he needs to give an account for how his living in an unreal world is making
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.720]   his real-world impact greater for the good of people and the glory of God.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.040]   I think our friend should reflect on the fact that the Bible refers to the deceitfulness
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.020]   of sin, Hebrews 3:13.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.040]   That should send off alarms in his mind, because deceit is essentially creating a sense that
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.880]   what is unreal is more to be desired than what is real.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.480]   I would ask our friend, are you not finding thrills by investing your time and your emotions
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.080]   and your money in unreality rather than reality?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.920]   Is that not a problem?
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.700]   Number three, it seems to me that there is good evidence that our young friend has already
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.260]   entered a seriously blinding fog.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.360]   When he calls putting down $50 a week modest gambling, he's lost touch with reality.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.860]   This is not modest.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.140]   A nickel might be modest.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.500]   This is serious.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.260]   $50 a week is $200 a month, $2,400 a year.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.580]   One half the world's population lives on $2.50 a day, which is $1,750 a week, which is below
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.540]   what he's gambling.
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:24.180]   Our friend is throwing to the wind up to $50 a week, calling it modest gambling.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.980]   So there's good evidence he has lost touch with reality, and I would plead, wake up,
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.980]   friend.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.300]   Wake up.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.140]   Number four, it is very difficult to believe that gambling $20 to $50 a week is happening
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.580]   simply to add an emotional buzz to the entertainment.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.280]   That would be bad enough.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.420]   But in fact, it is almost certain that his motive includes the desire that he would win
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.040]   and thus get more money.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:01.200]   The desire to get more money by putting other people's money at risk and doing no biblically
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:10.040]   warranted wholesome work is certainly the sign of at least an incipient desire to get
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.700]   rich, which the Bible says is suicidal.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.500]   First Timothy 6:9, "Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation."
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.060]   That's what's happening.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:29.580]   Into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.620]   "For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evils.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.780]   It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.260]   with many pangs."
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:48.260]   Number five, our young friend needs to pause and remember none of his money belongs to
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.220]   him, ultimately.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.380]   It all belongs to God.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:01.580]   First Chronicles 29 14, "All things come from you, and of your own have we given you."
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:09.260]   And I would say quite bluntly and forthrightly and confidently, you have no right to risk
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.540]   God's money this way.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.300]   Managers don't gamble with their master's money, period.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.020]   Financial trustees may not gamble with the trust fund.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:29.020]   In the parable of the talents, Jesus says that he will take account for how we have
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.940]   handled his resources, which belong to him.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.620]   To gamble with God's money on trivialities like this is a kind of embezzlement.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:50.500]   Number six, gambling is a massive social sickness in our culture, bringing millions and millions
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.420]   of people to ruin, especially the poor.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:01.500]   It sucks on the poor more than anyone else, the people who can least afford it.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.640]   I don't think Christians should be a part of the entire system of lotteries and casinos
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.380]   and online gambling of any sort.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:19.820]   It is an entire structure of devastation for millions of people with no biblical warrant.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.700]   And finally, number seven, and this relates back to the third thing I said, there is a
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:34.260]   vastly better way for our friend to find joy in how he uses $50 a week.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.460]   The lowest form of the argument would simply be this.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:47.980]   If at age 25 you put away $50 a week into a well-invested stock fund, you will, with
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:57.300]   almost no risk, have $237,000 in the bank when you are 50 years old.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:05.720]   It's a house owned free and clear for what you are risking every week on games.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.940]   But betterâ€”there's a better argument than that.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.660]   The sons of this age are smarter than the sons of light.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:20.420]   But better than that would probably be, since our friend seems to have so much discretionary
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:30.060]   money, what gloriously happy, helpful, good deeds could you do in people's lives as you
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:37.540]   creatively sought outâ€”use all that fantasy creativity and excellence, seek out ways to
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:45.420]   invest $50 a week, $200 a month in the causes of justice and gospel spreading and relief
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   of suffering?
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.700]   Oh my goodness, how much fun that would be!
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.700]   Yes.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:58.620]   Believe me, friend, it is more blessed to give than to receive or to invest creatively
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:05.140]   in the eternal joys of other people than to play with God's money in the dream world
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.940]   of fantasy football.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.180]   Wow, that ended with a punch.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.060]   Thanks for your concerns, Pastor John.

[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.860]   Charles Spurgeon once said that "There is no joy in this world like union with Christ.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.220]   The more we can feel it, the happier we are."
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.700]   That's a great quote.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.620]   Union with Christ is one of the great prominent themes of the New Testament, but what exactly
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.620]   is it?
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.820]   We'll explore it next time on Wednesday, Union with Christ.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.820]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:09.820]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.060]   you
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.060]   you

[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   you
