[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   All right, Jesse, that's making me hungry, thirsty.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.600]   I feel like I need some Magic Mind of Monk pack
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.360]   to get going.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.160]   But let's dive into some questions.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.760]   Our first question of the episode
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.080]   comes from Worried Housewife,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.720]   who writes, "How can a housewife implement deep work
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.160]   "into her life, or is it only for advancing in career work
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.320]   "or for creator, writers, et cetera?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.720]   "I love your book, however, I am mostly a housewife
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.720]   "and I feel a bit anxious because the self-help books
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.960]   "seem to imply unless I am writing books
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.740]   "or working towards business, my life is mediocre.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.280]   "I wanna be among those who feel accomplished
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.120]   "and productive.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.520]   "What would your advice be for someone implementing
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.120]   "the deep life in this situation?"
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.680]   So I don't know, Jesse, is housewife a word
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.120]   we're not supposed to use anymore?
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.320]   It doesn't feel like that's the word
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.820]   we're supposed to use anymore.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.200]   - I mean, she listed it, so I guess you--
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.920]   - Yeah, it's her self-description.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.760]   I'm reading verbatim.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.640]   I'm thinking stay-at-home parent is probably
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.640]   the word of choice.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.840]   So, well, for those-- - You're probably right.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.720]   - For those who are concerned, I am reading verbatim.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.720]   I'm reading verbatim the question.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.440]   All right, so this is a good question.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.160]   First of all, I think there's a semantic issue
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   that we often have on the show, let's get back to,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.480]   which is what exactly do we mean by deep work?
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.120]   Because again, I talk about this all the time.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.120]   I think deep work gets generalized into areas
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.420]   in which it was not meant to originally apply.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.080]   So really, the intention behind the phrase deep work
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.140]   is very focused.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.220]   It is when you're doing a specific type
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.760]   of cognitive-heavy work, it is a mode of doing that work
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.940]   in which you minimize back-and-forth context switching.
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.520]   So you give the thing you're working on full attention
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.980]   with minimal back-and-forth context switching,
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.800]   the main argument being that if you have a hard cognitive
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.880]   task to do, giving that sustained attention
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.080]   without context shifting is gonna be more effective
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.560]   than trying to work on that task
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.600]   while also switching your attention back and forth.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.760]   So that is functionally what deep work is.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.240]   And then the larger hypothesis in the book "Deep Work"
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.560]   is that this is broadly valuable
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.360]   in a lot of knowledge work fields,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.680]   and it's becoming more valuable
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.840]   in a lot of knowledge work fields,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.220]   especially in the American context,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.200]   and we're not paying attention to it.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.920]   So that we're setting up work systems
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.000]   that have an accidental side effect
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.520]   of requiring lots of context switching,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   requiring lots of time fragmenting,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.360]   make it very difficult to actually work on cognitive tasks
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.240]   in this manner, and so we execute those tasks worse,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.400]   and so the argument is we should actually prioritize
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.760]   in that work context, giving people unbroken time
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.300]   to work without distraction.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's very narrow.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.680]   So that would have very little relevance
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.640]   if you're asking about, I'm at home,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.880]   I'm at home with the kids.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.640]   So you're not working in a knowledge work job
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.720]   that's asking of you to do these sort of very specific
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   cognitively demanding work tasks.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.440]   And so these worries aren't relevant to that situation.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.200]   But I think this is just a semantic issue
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.880]   because later in the question you say,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.600]   what's your advice for someone implementing
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.880]   the deep life in the situation?
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.160]   And there I think we're getting to the fruitful question.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.520]   I think this is what you're actually asking about
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.680]   is the deep life and perhaps the role of work
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.360]   or focused work in the deep life.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   And I think this is a critical question.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.560]   'Cause we often extrapolate deep work
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.920]   to mean the deep life, but they're two different things.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.740]   Deep work can have a place in a deep life,
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.760]   but they're two different things.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.840]   So I'm glad we have a chance to actually talk about this
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.280]   and to try to make a distinction.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.840]   So in the theory of the deep life,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.680]   which is something that was not developed
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.120]   in the book "Deep Work", I introduced the term
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.840]   in the book "Deep Work", but don't really get into it.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.800]   I wasn't ready to get into that yet.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.360]   But in the theory of the deep life that we've evolved
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.040]   on my newsletter and here on this podcast,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.640]   the idea is you identify the areas of your life
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.600]   that are important.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.920]   And in each of these areas, you focus intensely
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.320]   on the things that are high value
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.960]   and try to minimize time wasted on the things
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.880]   that are not important or of lower value in that area.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.040]   So it's really triaging your time and attention
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.920]   towards the things that really matter.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.080]   There's a core component to the deep life that says
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.360]   for the things that really matter in this type of calculus,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.840]   you might even wanna make radical moves to support them.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.580]   So make radical changes to how you live your life,
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.200]   to really invest in the small number of things
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.080]   that are most important to you.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.820]   That is the underlying concept of the deep life.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.580]   Craft is just one piece of the different areas of your life
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.260]   that might be important.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.360]   And it's important depends on what you're doing,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.520]   what your actual situation is.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.240]   So I think regardless of whether you're working in an office
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.220]   or you're at home taking care of kids,
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.400]   or you're in between jobs and single,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.680]   whatever the situation is,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.000]   the calculus of the deep life is relevant.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.480]   What matters to me in my life?
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.880]   Am I investing in those on things that really matter
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.600]   and not wasting too much time on things that don't?
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.760]   That's always relevant.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.080]   And I think that is critical.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.120]   If you don't have that framework,
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.240]   you're gonna be completely adrift.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.120]   And so there's nothing about being at home with kids
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.600]   that says that framework's not gonna work.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.320]   If anything, it's gonna be even more important.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.840]   It's that framework that's gonna make sure
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.040]   that you don't get so caught up in X
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.160]   that you forget to actually think
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.480]   about this other piece of your life,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.920]   the community involvement, constitution,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.400]   your health and fitness,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.760]   you're seeing the different parts of your life
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.520]   and making them important.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.680]   The family commitment, the family there
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.720]   is gonna be really critical
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.740]   when you do that deep life calculus.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.040]   I mean, this is a,
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.020]   we talk about radical moves to align your life
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.420]   with your current values.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.280]   If you're dedicating your time
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.560]   to trying to help your kids raise
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.800]   in a stable, loving environment
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.680]   and cultivate the type of attributes and values
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.560]   you would want in leaders and adults
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.400]   who in the future we're gonna look to with respect,
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.460]   that's an incredibly important endeavor.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.520]   And so when you're thinking about things,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.120]   the deep life, work is just a piece of it.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.520]   And the importance of that depends
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   on what you're doing in your life right then.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.920]   So I wouldn't worry about that at all.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.160]   I would focus on the deep life
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.620]   and making sure that each of the areas
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.840]   of your deep life are getting attention.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.560]   That let's say the kids needs aren't swapping other needs
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.280]   that are also important to you
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.080]   or to the other people in your life.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.840]   Deep work by itself is not that interesting.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.760]   It's interesting if you're a knowledge worker
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.280]   who works with your brain
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.700]   to try to add value to information,
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.600]   then yeah, you wanna be doing deep work
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.160]   because if you do it with a lot of context shifting,
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.320]   you're not gonna be doing it as well.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.360]   But that's just a particular job.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.960]   That's just a particular endeavor.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.200]   I don't wanna put a moral valuation on deep work
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.320]   that basically focus cognitive work is somehow high value
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.640]   and anything else isn't high value.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.280]   No, it's high value in the context of knowledge work,
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.120]   deep is better than distracted.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.320]   But you leave the context of knowledge work,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.360]   it's not relevant.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.680]   So anyways, I hope that's helpful.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.960]   Let's use the deep life as the framing,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.420]   the thing that has some sort of moral valence to it.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.160]   That this, that's a structure to your life
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.560]   that's trying to intentionally focus on what matters
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.800]   versus those things that don't,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.680]   that is universally important.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.080]   And let's narrow in deep work to say,
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.900]   this is an approach to doing a certain type of activity
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.600]   that a lot of people do and it's relevant
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.760]   and we need to care about it,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   but it is not by itself the necessary foundation
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.800]   of a good life.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.520]   We get that a lot, Jesse, don't we?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   I think the deep work becomes a stand in for much bigger.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.280]   - Yeah, we've been getting a lot of those questions lately,
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.440]   especially from folks who are maybe retired or at home,
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.540]   yeah, this question.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.720]   Yeah, it's been coming up a lot.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.840]   - Yep, yep, so good.
