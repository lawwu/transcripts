[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.760]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.060]   My guest today is Bill Eddy.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.480]   Bill Eddy is a practicing lawyer, a professional mediator,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.660]   a licensed therapist, and on the faculty
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.280]   of the School of Law at Pepperdine University.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.280]   He is a world expert in conflict resolution.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.600]   In particular, how to resolve conflicts
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   with what are called high-conflict personalities.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.440]   I should be very clear
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.040]   that these high-conflict personalities,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.360]   as you'll learn today,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.820]   are not in a category of so-called personality disorders.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, it is the case
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.180]   that people with high-conflict personalities
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.400]   often also have borderline personality disorder,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.480]   narcissistic personality disorder,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.480]   or suffer from bipolar depression.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.320]   However, as you'll soon learn,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.240]   people who have this high-conflict personality type
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.680]   could fall into any one of those three different categories,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.200]   any combination of them, or none of them at all.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.640]   These high-conflict personalities
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.160]   essentially come in two flavors.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.760]   Some are very outwardly combative.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760]   They like to argue.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.120]   They like to generate conflict
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.120]   in a way that's very overt, very obvious.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.440]   The others, which comprise about 50%
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.640]   of high-conflict personality types, are very passive.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.240]   They play the victim, or they leverage other people,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.360]   so-called negative advocates,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.160]   in order to achieve their goal
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   of creating a lot of conflict
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.800]   where they always appear as the victim.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.840]   During today's discussion,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.080]   you'll learn how to identify
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.120]   these high-conflict personality types
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.960]   based on some very simple questions
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.800]   that you can ask yourself about them.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.960]   He also explains how to deal with these people
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.920]   in the workplace setting, in relationships,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.280]   and importantly, of course,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.360]   how to disengage from these people,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.480]   not just in the short term, but permanently.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.120]   Now, across today's discussion,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.800]   you'll realize that Bill Eddy is very sensitive
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.480]   both to the suffering
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.400]   that high-conflict personalities cause for other people,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.240]   and therefore, how to identify them,
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.120]   avoid them, and disengage from them,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.480]   but he also makes it a point
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.520]   not to demonize these high-conflict personality types.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.240]   Instead, as a mediator, as a lawyer, and as a therapist,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.680]   he is really most interested
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.640]   in helping people resolve their conflicts with these people
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.880]   and find the best, most peaceful path forward
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.480]   for conflict resolution.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.240]   Dr. Bill Eddy is the author of several important books
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.680]   related to this topic and related topics,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.320]   such as "Five Types of People that Can Ruin Your Life."
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.800]   It's an excellent book, I've read it,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.320]   and I highly recommend it for everyone.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.880]   He's also written books about adult bullies,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.120]   which are becoming increasingly common online
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.420]   and in real life,
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.680]   and about mediating conflict resolution and separations
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.920]   and things like divorce,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.620]   and in family court situations
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.320]   where he spent a lot of his professional career as a lawyer.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.560]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.200]   you will have a lot of new practical tools
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.520]   for being able to identify
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.400]   these high-conflict personality types
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.360]   and learning how to navigate forward
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.220]   and, frankly, away from them in the best way possible.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.200]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.920]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.200]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.100]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.560]   to the general public.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.640]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.600]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.900]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.320]   Maui Nui Venison is 100% wild-harvested venison
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.600]   from the island of Maui,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.240]   and it is the most nutrient-dense
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.320]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.980]   I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.280]   about the fact that most of us should be consuming
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.080]   about one gram of quality protein
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.360]   per pound of body weight every day.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   That protein provides critical building blocks
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.940]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.840]   but it also promotes overall health
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.480]   given the importance of muscle tissue as an organ.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.320]   Eating enough quality protein each day
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.140]   is also a terrific way to stave off hunger.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.380]   One of the key things, however,
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.660]   is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.940]   without ingesting excess calories.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.820]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.440]   per calorie ratio,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.420]   so that getting one gram of quality protein
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.460]   per pound of body weight is both easy
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.340]   and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.600]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.940]   They have venison steaks,
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.140]   ground venison, and venison bone broth.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.980]   I personally like all of those.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.320]   In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.560]   pretty much every day,
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.400]   and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.040]   And if you're traveling a lot or you're simply on the go,
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.720]   they have Maui Nui Venison sticks,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.920]   which have 10 grams of protein per stick
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.640]   at just 55 calories, and they're extremely convenient.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.320]   You can pretty much take them anywhere.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.240]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.880]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.640]   to get 20% off your membership or first order.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by ExpressVPN.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.760]   ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.000]   that keeps your data secure and private.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.520]   It does that by routing your internet activity
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.260]   through their servers and encrypting it
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.920]   so that no one can see or sell your data.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.120]   Now, I'm familiar with the effects
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.040]   of not securing my data well enough.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.640]   Several years ago, I had one of my bank accounts hacked,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.520]   and it was a terrible amount of work to have that reversed
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.200]   and for the account to be secured.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.040]   When that happened,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.760]   I talked to my friends in the tech community,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.840]   and what they told me was that
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.400]   even though you think your internet connection
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.600]   may be secure, oftentimes it's not,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.560]   especially if you're using Wi-Fi networks,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.520]   such as those on planes, in hotels, at coffee shops,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.080]   and other public places.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.680]   Surprisingly, even at home,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.700]   your data might not be as secure as you think.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.160]   To make sure that what I described before
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.680]   would never happen to me again,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.000]   I started using ExpressVPN.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.640]   The great thing about ExpressVPN
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.600]   is that I don't even notice that it's running
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.820]   since the connection it provides is so fast.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.140]   I have it on my computer and on my phone,
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.520]   and I keep it on whenever I'm connected to the internet.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.280]   With ExpressVPN, I know everything is secure.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.800]   My web browsing, all my passwords, all my data,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.200]   and of course, anything that's behind an account wall,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.100]   like a bank account.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.960]   It can't be tracked,
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.840]   and no one can access or steal your data,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.760]   which is terrific.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.860]   If you'd like to start protecting your internet activity
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.160]   using ExpressVPN,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.440]   you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.600]   and you can get an extra three months free.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Again, that's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/huberman
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.260]   to get an extra three months free.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.160]   And now for my discussion with Bill Eddy.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.060]   Bill Eddy, welcome.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.400]   - Thanks so much for having me.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.040]   I'm excited to discuss this with you.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.360]   - I've read your books.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.640]   I learned about them from perhaps
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   one of the smartest people I know.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.320]   She said, "You should check out this book
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   called 'Five Types of People That Can Ruin Your Life'."
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.000]   And I said, "Well, that's an impressive title."
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.340]   And I tore through the book, learned a ton.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.680]   You have a number of other books.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   I mentioned them in my introduction.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.280]   And I suppose it's appropriate to say
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   that you are an expert in conflict, conflict resolution,
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.520]   and in particular,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.200]   how to deal with people that are high conflict.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.080]   So maybe you could just tell us
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.760]   what a high conflict person is,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   how common are these people,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.280]   and how does this overlap
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.920]   with some of the more traditional
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.500]   quote-unquote diagnoses of personality disorders?
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.700]   - Yeah, it's fascinating,
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.460]   because I started out as a clinical social worker,
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.340]   working with children and families
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.640]   in psychiatric hospitals, outpatient clinics,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.260]   but I really like conflict resolution.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.460]   So I went to law school to get a law degree
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.660]   so I could do mediation, other conflict resolution,
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.700]   and I practiced family law.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.400]   And when I started in family court,
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.240]   I noticed right away that a lot of the conflicts
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.480]   seem to be driven by people's personalities
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.880]   rather than the legal issue,
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.780]   because I was also doing mediation in my office.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.200]   I go to court in the morning,
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.000]   do mediation in the afternoon, same exact issues.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.840]   In the morning, people were stuck
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.960]   for two or three years.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.160]   In the afternoon, two or three mediation sessions,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.900]   shook hands, went separate ways.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.340]   So in family court, a lot of people
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.580]   aren't familiar with this,
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.140]   but since the 1980s, there's been the use
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.600]   of the term high-conflict families.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.140]   And family court lawyers, judges, mediators, therapists,
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.780]   identified high-conflict families
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.620]   as repeatedly coming to court to make decisions,
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.320]   as having a lot of hostility,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.220]   of just seeming driven in one direction,
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.260]   unable to be flexible, and in many ways,
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.020]   unable to truly have empathy for their kids,
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.380]   so they'd fight over their kids.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.940]   And so high-conflict families was a term,
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.100]   when I became a lawyer in 1993,
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.260]   I was like, wait a minute,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.620]   these aren't high-conflict families.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.760]   These have maybe one, maybe two people
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.260]   with high-conflict personalities,
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.700]   or traits of personality disorders,
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.540]   which I knew about since 1980,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.620]   and working in hospitals and outpatient clinics.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.540]   - Because you're also a clinical psychologist.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.540]   - Clinical social worker.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.420]   - Clinical social worker.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.300]   - So I got a master's in social work in 1981,
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.200]   then I became, I got licensed to do therapy on my own.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.700]   So I'm a licensed clinical social worker in California.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.580]   I can diagnose disorders,
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.620]   I can do treatment without supervision.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.740]   I went through that, and that's how I became licensed.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.180]   So when I came into Family Corps, I go,
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.500]   this is the same patterns when I was working,
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   say, with people in the psychiatric hospital,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   who had addictions, depression, all these problems,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.640]   and my job as the hospital social worker
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.900]   was to help them with their outside problems,
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.260]   their family problems,
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.100]   so I did family counseling for the patients.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.820]   With their job, maybe their employer wanted to fire them
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.020]   'cause of their behavior,
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.940]   and I tried to help keep their job.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.380]   Maybe they were getting evicted,
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.040]   their landlord couldn't stand their behavior,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.980]   and I'd solve one problem, and I'd go,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.820]   I've got you into marriage counseling,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.340]   and your husband or wife's committed
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.040]   to working on the relationship,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.540]   and I'd go, yay, I accomplished something.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.560]   Next day, Bill, my landlord wants to kick me out.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.860]   Okay, I'd convince their landlord
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.420]   to give them one more chance.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.660]   Yay, Bill, my job wants to fire me.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.340]   Can you help?
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.540]   What they have is a pattern of conflict behavior
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.460]   that doesn't get resolved,
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.820]   and that's the high-conflict families
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.620]   that I saw in Family Corps.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.140]   So that's where that connection came from,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.620]   which I would not have arrived at
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.540]   if I hadn't been a therapist and also a lawyer.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.100]   - My understanding from reading your book
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.940]   is that this high-conflict personality phenotype
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.740]   is equally distributed between men and women.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.620]   What is the percentage of people
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.500]   that have this high-conflict phenotype?
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.860]   And then maybe we can drill into a little bit
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.140]   of how that shows up.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.420]   It's different forms of expression.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.380]   - Yeah, well, let me say a little bit
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.460]   about the difference between high-conflict personalities
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.060]   and personality disorders,
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.660]   because we have a lot of research on personality disorders,
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.580]   including statistics, which I'll give you.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.460]   We don't have a lot of research
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.980]   on high-conflict personalities.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.260]   People have talked about it, like I said,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.060]   since the 1980s in Family Corps,
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.420]   and my own observations with thousands of cases
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.060]   of high-conflict personalities
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.100]   is it's pretty much men and women.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.340]   My law practice, I've represented pretty much 50/50
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.740]   men and women, mostly custody disputes,
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.540]   mothers and fathers, so I got a good impression.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.580]   Personality disorders, there's a lot of research on,
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.860]   and I mention in the book some statistics,
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.660]   and they came from the personality disorder research.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.940]   So what they found,
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.300]   they studied the 10 personality disorders.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.620]   In the early 2000s, a big study,
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.060]   National Institutes of Health,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.060]   the alcoholism subdivision of NIH,
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.820]   they wanted to see how prevalent
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.500]   personality disorders were with substance abuse,
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.020]   with domestic conflicts, with criminal behavior,
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.580]   and workplace conflicts.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.140]   And so this study, they looked at all 10 personalities,
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.100]   came up with numbers for each.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   Five of them seemed prone to high-conflict behavior.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.380]   So these five, I can give you statistics on,
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.900]   and I can give you breakdown male and female,
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.020]   all from 20 years ago, big study,
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.780]   'cause it hasn't been repeated since.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.020]   So basically cluster B,
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.140]   that's narcissistic,
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.420]   borderline, antisocial, histrionic,
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.540]   but we see a lot of paranoid in legal disputes.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.420]   And some research says paranoid personality disorder
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.700]   is the most likely to sue their employer
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.140]   of the personality disorders.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.420]   So that's gotten attention too.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.660]   So here's some numbers.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.700]   First of all, narcissistic personality disorder,
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.700]   they found was about 6% of adults in the United States.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.700]   They found the statistics on that was 38% female
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.500]   and 62% male.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.940]   So that's more heavily male.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.460]   20 years ago, could be different now
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.980]   'cause of environmental influences.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.700]   Borderline, also about 6%.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.700]   This was 53% female, 47% male.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.060]   Almost 50/50.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.300]   And that shocked the mental health world
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.940]   'cause we've always thought of borderline
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.460]   as a female disorder.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.460]   But Marsha Lanahan, the big name in treatment for borderline
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.220]   says she agrees, she thinks that's true.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.420]   And I think that's true as a family lawyer
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.260]   because a lot of the men that we see
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.380]   engaged in domestic violence
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.380]   seem to have the borderline personality pattern.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.580]   And the domestic violence is much more male than female.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.580]   Then antisocial, it's around 4%.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.740]   And that's about 75% male, 25% female.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:48.180]   Histrionic, it's about 2%.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.580]   And they found this is about 50/50,
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.260]   which again surprised people
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.260]   'cause you think drama, center of attention, all of that.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.780]   But, and this may be very much environmental influence.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.380]   Our culture today teaches, especially young men,
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.460]   to try to get attention.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.660]   Ride your skateboard behind a car or jump off a building,
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.340]   do all these dramatic things to get attention.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.460]   - Or social media.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.140]   - And social media's really encouraged that.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.100]   Everyone wants attention
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.460]   and now you kind of have to fight for it in our culture.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.460]   And so men as well as women are getting out there
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.580]   often in dramatic ways.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.260]   So it came out about 50/50.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260]   Paranoid, it's about 4%.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.260]   Came out, I think it was 57 to 43%,
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.700]   somewhere right around that.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.620]   A little more heavily female, but not all that far apart.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.340]   Altogether, it's really roughly 50/50.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.580]   - Very interesting.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.340]   And how does this high-conflict personality
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.580]   cut through all these personality disorder phenotypes?
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.260]   Because, oh, and I should also ask,
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.060]   I could imagine that some people who are borderline,
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.940]   perhaps, are also histrionic.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.640]   Is that possible to fall into multiple categories?
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   - And the study actually broke down some of that.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.680]   So in the research, they particularly,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.700]   one that I remember is borderline and narcissist.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.060]   And it came out around 38% overlap.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.660]   So, and I teach--
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.380]   - People who are borderline also can often be narcissistic.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.300]   - Have narcissistic personality disorder.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.140]   - I see.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.860]   - And so this is personality disorder overlap.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.100]   Now there's a whole continuum here.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.620]   So many people have traits but don't have a disorder.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.940]   The current DSM says the total personality disorder
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.260]   is around 10%.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.400]   Now, that's taking an average of studies
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.900]   from around the world.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:02.780]   The study I quoted earlier in the US said 15%
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.520]   have a personality disorder.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:10.580]   So in the US, we're seeing that's significant.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.300]   And that's the one that said 38% overlap,
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.980]   borderlines, and narcissists.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.380]   I think that it fits for me.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.300]   Because when I teach lawyers, from my own experience,
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.740]   I can say you have a client that comes on like a narcissist,
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.980]   they're very self-centered and putting you down,
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.500]   saying they're superior, here's some tips to deal with them.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.600]   But they also may have wide mood swings,
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.260]   which is more associated with borderline.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.580]   So you need to butter up their ego, honestly,
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.700]   not praise them for something that's real, that they did.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.000]   But also they really need empathy.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.460]   They have wide mood swings,
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.380]   that's someone that needs a lot of empathy.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.740]   Say, wow, I can see how upset you are,
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.660]   this is so important, and they calm down.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.540]   So you have to use both sets of responses
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.020]   to deal with someone that has that combination.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.380]   You mentioned borderline and histrionic.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.860]   There's a lot of similarities.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.820]   So we see overlap with that.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.560]   But I've seen every combination.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.700]   But what I don't know in family court
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.980]   is, is it the disorder or just traits?
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.060]   And the disorder doesn't matter to me.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.280]   It's the pattern that matters,
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.580]   'cause if I see this pattern, I know I should do that.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.620]   That's the key.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.340]   - I can imagine that in family court,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.220]   it's especially complicated,
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.860]   given that some of these things, not all,
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.180]   but some of these have a genetic component,
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.740]   certainly a situational component.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.700]   So you could potentially be dealing with
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.500]   trying to work out a situation
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.200]   for the benefit of children
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.880]   that have some of the same personality disorders
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.960]   as their parents.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.920]   Could be really tricky.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.040]   - Well, what's interesting,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.500]   and it's very rewarding work when things can go well,
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.400]   when the lawyers get it, the judge gets it,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   everyone gets it, what's happening,
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.040]   they can make orders that fit the situation
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.280]   and help protect children from bad behavior
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.800]   and help get parents some help.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   So substance abuse is a bigger issue in family court
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:21.160]   than personality disorders, but almost neck and neck.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.240]   We talk about substance abuse all the time openly,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.160]   there's treatment, everyone recognizes the signs.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.960]   We don't talk about personality disorders in our culture,
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.480]   and that's like flying under the radar.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.440]   - So Ari, I'm just gonna pause you for a second there.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.960]   I think it's such a key point
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.720]   in a very interesting paper that you sent me,
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.180]   which by the way, I'll provide a link to
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.760]   in our show note captions.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.760]   It essentially kicks off by saying that
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:54.040]   the movement toward explaining to people what alcohol,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.240]   I think they now call it alcohol use disorder or alcoholism
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.520]   was and is in the 1970s and '80s,
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.400]   was a crucial move forward for the judicial system.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.800]   And I think nowadays people generally understand
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   that addiction is not just a lack of willpower,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.000]   that there are brain circuits that become hijacked
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.040]   by substances or behaviors that these brain circuits
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.320]   were designed to promote our adaptive evolution,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.240]   but they can be hijacked by behaviors and substances
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.200]   that render people really just unable
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.760]   to control their addictive behavior.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.280]   I think nowadays that that box is checked,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.120]   and it's wonderful that the judicial system
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.680]   understands that, right?
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.440]   Because then it can work with that.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.480]   I don't think that the general public
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.460]   has yet come to the full appreciation
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.280]   of these personality disorders
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.440]   and these high conflict personalities
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.880]   and how pervasive they are,
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.520]   probably because of their prevalence.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.080]   It's just sort of all around us
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.120]   and in all sorts of interactions.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.460]   And here's the question,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.760]   high conflict interactions
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.960]   tend to be quote unquote dramatic.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.840]   And there tends to be almost a reward
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.000]   for dramatic behavior, as you said, online,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.880]   in politics, in the media,
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.600]   the more dramatic, the more salience,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.360]   the more salience, the more people click,
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.920]   the more people watch.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.480]   And then the algorithms are designed
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.280]   to look at like dwell time,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.360]   which is nerd speak for how long people look at stuff.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.640]   And so you could see how this stuff could be fed
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.440]   in the same way that for nearly 75 years
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.320]   leading up to the 1970s,
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.900]   alcohol use disorder was sort of fed by the culture.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.160]   The other 5 p.m. happy hour.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.600]   Coming up in science, I would go to scientific meetings
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.120]   and it was like, okay, five o'clock hits, let's all drink.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.600]   And I always thought this is kind of crazy,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.800]   especially given that there was also a lot of concern
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.200]   about the kinds of interactions
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.440]   that drinking can create in the work environment.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.920]   - It leads to high conflict behavior.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.440]   - Exactly, so anyway, I don't wanna riff too long on this,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.040]   but first of all, this is just lauding
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.360]   the important work that you're doing.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.960]   Second, how should we think about
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.600]   this high conflict personality phenotype?
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.100]   Should we be calling people out?
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.220]   Like, hey, that's a narcissist.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.000]   Hey, that's a borderline histrionic person.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.900]   Or is there a more, I guess,
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.060]   something that embraces a little bit more of the humanity
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.540]   and the real issue at hand?
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.020]   I think that's what you're trying to do.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.580]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.940]   And you may have seen me shaking my head no
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.240]   and said, should we point this out to people?
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.180]   That's the last thing you wanna do.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.940]   In fact, don't do that.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.660]   And the reason why is personality disorders,
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.860]   oh, oh, let me just quickly distinguish
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.060]   between personality disorders, high conflict personalities.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.940]   The difference, and there's a chart
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.100]   in the beginning of the book
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.620]   with two circles overlapping, a lot of overlap.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.060]   But the main thing about personality disorders
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.300]   is they're stuck in a narrow range
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.320]   of interpersonal behavior.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.140]   So some aren't high conflict people, some are.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.160]   Thing about high conflict people
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.880]   is that they're preoccupied with blame,
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.500]   that blaming others is a big part of their life.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.980]   So when you're dealing with a high conflict person
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.220]   who's blaming and has a personality disorder,
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.140]   you get a stuck pattern of behavior.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.500]   You get high conflict personalities or high conflict people.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.780]   So they're persistent in acting that way.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.020]   That's the overlap with personality disorders
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.360]   is they don't reflect, they don't change,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.300]   they just keep blame is everybody out there.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.300]   So recognizing that difference and similarity.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.300]   So about half of people I think with personality disorders,
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.220]   and this is just my estimate,
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.320]   have high conflict personalities and about half don't.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.860]   I've worked with borderlines in the psych hospital,
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.000]   narcissists that don't blame other people,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.820]   narcissists that are just self-centered,
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.060]   and borderlines who are more frustrated
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.940]   with themselves than anybody else.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.700]   So that's an important distinction.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.740]   - You beautifully distinguish
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.800]   between high conflict personalities
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.580]   and these personality disorders.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.620]   And I just want to make sure everyone hears again
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.580]   that about half of people with personality disorders
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.380]   would fall into this high conflict personality.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.000]   - In my estimation, I don't have research yet.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.980]   - And the distinguishing feature seems to be
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.100]   that high conflict personalities are often
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.460]   or constantly casting blame on others
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.780]   for the difficulties of their life essentially.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.380]   - And that's why they have conflicts.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.860]   That's why, and they escalate
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.580]   instead of getting worked on and resolved.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.660]   - So I can imagine that the high conflict person
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.700]   doesn't always appear as high conflict.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.620]   In fact, this is something that you've alluded to many times
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.260]   already in this conversation and certainly in your book
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.880]   that sometimes these high conflict personalities
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.860]   come in kind of under the radar
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.580]   and that can be confusing to people
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.060]   or they can go undetected for a long time.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.740]   - Yeah, so part of it goes with the specific personalities.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:03.220]   So high conflict people with borderline personality traits
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.660]   or histrionic personality traits
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.240]   are often more openly dramatic.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.580]   And so they might really shock you
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.220]   that suddenly they start yelling, screaming,
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.340]   throwing things just 'cause you're having
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.780]   an average conversation, very disproportionate.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.020]   But some, and it tends to be more
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.140]   of the antisocial personalities,
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.740]   some narcissistic personalities
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.780]   can look really reasonable on the surface.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.260]   And they've actually had a lifetime of experience
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.340]   at looking good, which kind of covers up
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.620]   all the stuff under the surface.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.540]   And I think of a couple examples.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.340]   So for example, and I deal sometimes
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.980]   with domestic violence cases.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.260]   So let's say an abuser says, in court says,
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.060]   "Oh, well, I was helping her because she was so upset.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.240]   "I took her keys away and I held her down on the bed
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.820]   "'cause I was afraid she would leave
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.180]   "and get into a car crash."
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.540]   Well, there may be rare occasions where that's true,
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.300]   but that's a common story
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.820]   that we get from domestic abusers.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.920]   Or in court, I've seen this,
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.740]   where there'll be a very reasonable person
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.740]   kind of explaining the situation
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.880]   and their partner, more often a woman,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.380]   is just emotional, is a mess, maybe even in tears.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.140]   And people don't realize about 80% of divorces
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.260]   in court today, people represent themselves.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.540]   And so there's these conversations
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.700]   and the judge is like, "Whoa, this guy's being
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.380]   "really reasonable and this woman's a mess.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.460]   "I mean, I'm gonna go with what he's saying."
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.620]   And so a lot of stuff slips under the radar that way.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.940]   But gender-wise, it could be the reverse.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.940]   And a lot of relationships people get into,
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.860]   people make themselves look really good
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.500]   and then the negative stuff comes out
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.620]   weeks, months, maybe a year later.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.700]   So that's why we say wait a year
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.440]   until you decide to commit.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.060]   Because nowadays, who knows, you may have someone
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.980]   that really is good at covering their bad behavior.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.040]   - Yeah, let's hover on that one particular point,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.220]   because this is perhaps one of the most important
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.220]   takeaways from your work.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.740]   Could you just spell out this first year principle?
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:31.740]   And perhaps it's useful for us to also acknowledge
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.260]   that yes, there are a great many truly great stories
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.580]   about people who met one weekend,
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.140]   two weeks later got married,
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.060]   and then we're hearing the story 50 years later
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.300]   when they've got grandkids and great-grandkids,
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.420]   they thrived.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.960]   Or people met, got engaged three months later,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.480]   or in some cases got pregnant three months later,
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.580]   and they have this wonderful marriage
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.860]   and family story to tell.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.700]   We hear these stories
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.500]   and they're really wonderful stories, right?
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.420]   I mean, they sort of affirm your belief in humanity
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.200]   when you hear those stories.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.760]   And they are powerful.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.060]   But in discussing a little bit of this with you offline,
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.200]   you probably have witnessed more cases where people rushed
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   and that rushing to commit or to create
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.240]   led to more problems than it did good.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.720]   - Yes, and that's many, many of the high conflict divorces
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.080]   that I've worked on as a lawyer,
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.920]   and before that as a therapist,
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.520]   and sometimes as a mediator,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.720]   are, in my mind, kind of the bad luck stories.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.360]   Got a decent person, usually my client, of course,
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.600]   but something happened, they got together too fast,
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.240]   and then all this stuff came out.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.640]   And I really believe in today's world
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   that it is a matter of luck.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.680]   And that's why you should take a year to find out,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.360]   am I, did I draw the short straw in this relationship
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.880]   'cause I got this perfect looking person?
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.040]   Great record, all these good things.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.680]   But close relationships is where personality disorders
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.360]   come out, interpersonal difficulty,
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.800]   and the high conflict behaviors, mostly close relationships.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.740]   So they might, everyone might like them at work,
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.700]   but when you're home alone with them,
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.160]   they could be really terrible, yelling, hitting,
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.100]   doing all of this stuff.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.880]   So that's why we say wait a year.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.920]   I've had a lot of cases where people tell me,
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.120]   we just fell in love, it was beautiful,
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.360]   and everything was wonderful for about six months.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.320]   And then when I committed to get married,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.600]   all this stuff started showing up.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.760]   But I got married anyway 'cause I figured,
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.080]   well, time and love will heal everything, only it didn't.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.400]   So in today's world, there's a higher risk
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.360]   of getting a high conflict relationship, I must say.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.480]   And the description you gave is what people often tell me.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.620]   They say, my grandparents got married a week after they met
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.580]   and they just celebrated their 60th anniversary,
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.380]   they're still in love, everything's wonderful.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.620]   Your grandparents tended to know who they were marrying.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.260]   In today's world, not only don't you know,
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.120]   you don't have a history, but high conflict people
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.100]   have learned to cover up the full range of who they are.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.660]   And they're not bad people,
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.780]   and that's something I wanna emphasize.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.060]   They just have a different personality,
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.460]   and they may have been born this way,
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.940]   but they don't come with markings.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.940]   They don't come with the music like of Jaws, doo-doo-doo-doo.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.740]   They look good, and anybody, I think,
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.940]   is at risk of falling into a relationship like this.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.140]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.780]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.360]   By now, many of you have heard me say
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.120]   that if I could take just one supplement,
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.220]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.740]   The reason for that is AG1 is the highest quality
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.640]   and most complete
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.380]   of the foundational nutritional supplements available.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.820]   What that means is that it contains
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.200]   not just vitamins and minerals,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.580]   but also probiotics, prebiotics, and adaptogens
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.020]   to cover any gaps you may have in your diet
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.280]   and provide support for a demanding life.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.140]   For me, even if I eat mostly whole foods
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.340]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.280]   which I do for most of my food intake,
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.260]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.100]   and vegetables, vitamins and minerals,
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.160]   micronutrients, and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.620]   For that reason, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.260]   and often twice a day, once in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.280]   and again in the afternoon or evening.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.700]   When I do that, it clearly bolsters my energy,
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.280]   my immune system, and my gut microbiome.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.100]   These are all critical to brain function,
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.700]   mood, physical performance, and much more.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.160]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.300]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.860]   to claim their special offer.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.000]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.860]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.480]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.020]   to claim that special offer.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.420]   - I definitely wanna come back to this point that you made
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.900]   that you're not demonizing these people.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.100]   You're talking about how to behave with them
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.540]   or how to not behave with them in some cases
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.420]   in order to try and create
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.140]   the smoothest possible interactions.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.220]   In some cases, no interaction.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.900]   But if we could hover still a bit more
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   on this first-year idea.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.700]   My understanding is that no getting engaged,
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.060]   or for that matter, married,
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.940]   no conceiving children,
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.500]   and no moving in together in year one.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.980]   Are those the critical?
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.580]   - Except for the last one,
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.500]   is it's really don't commit like getting married
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.960]   within the first year.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.260]   Sometimes moving in together
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.740]   is a good way to find out
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.860]   what it's like up close with this person.
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.740]   - Yeah, you learn a lot by living with somebody.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.940]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.740]   And personality disorders,
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.260]   part of the definition is interpersonal dysfunction.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.020]   And that's close, that's close relationships.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.820]   So if you haven't had that close relationship,
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.680]   you don't see what happens when you leave your socks out
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.500]   or the caps off the toothpaste,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.940]   and some little thing is some huge storm.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.540]   - Or when somebody's sleep-deprived.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.420]   I always say you learn a lot about somebody
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.220]   after a bad night's sleep.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.820]   You end them, right?
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.700]   - Right.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.020]   But the key is patterns of behavior.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.420]   So one thing I wanna say is,
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.540]   everybody gets angry sometimes, that's fine.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.640]   Everybody yells sometimes.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.060]   Everybody criticizes sometimes.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.500]   But if they have a pattern,
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.120]   like their life pattern of relationship
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.840]   is to yell and scream and criticize and all that,
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.120]   whoa, this pattern is probably gonna keep going.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.360]   And as I mentioned earlier, I believe,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.780]   with personality disorders,
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.640]   it's a narrower pattern of behavior.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.640]   So it's more pattern-driven in several different settings,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.960]   family, maybe at work when it's closed,
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.600]   maybe in the community when it's closed.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.620]   So these are recognizable patterns,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.740]   as recognizable as alcoholism and addiction
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.620]   once people learn.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.620]   So that's the key.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.780]   Give yourself some time,
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.080]   see if this stuff comes to the surface.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   - I think you're raising a really interesting point,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.260]   which is that although nowadays we have more information
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.300]   about people available to us
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.220]   by way of the internet and social media,
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.660]   you made the comparison with our grandparents' era.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.520]   I'm 49 years old, so my grandparents...
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.200]   Actually, my grandparents knew each other
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.120]   from the time they were like in the eighth grade.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.800]   They eloped when they turned 18, boom,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.080]   went and got married, I think to the dismay of one side
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.920]   or the other side of parents,
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.620]   but then were married more than 50 years.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.440]   And grandkids, obviously, I'm one of them, et cetera.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.000]   And so you have these stories
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.920]   and we love these kinds of stories.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.880]   But as you point out, they knew each other very, very well
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.440]   and had for a long time.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.240]   Nowadays, one can quote, unquote, do their research,
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.880]   go online and look for things.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.840]   But would you argue that that's not complete information?
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.720]   - Right, I think it can be helpful.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.000]   I tell people, Google your partner and find out
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.060]   if there's some history there that may impact you.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.680]   But don't believe that's sufficient.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.220]   What I say that you really wanna talk to
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.760]   is relatives and friends of this person.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.240]   And what you really wanna do is see them in action
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.040]   with their relatives and friends.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.120]   - Relatives and friends.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.160]   - Yes, 'cause that's close relationships.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.040]   That's the key.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.920]   This is all about close relationships.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.160]   And that's what catches people by surprise.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.480]   They say, this person looks good at work.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.340]   Some people have worked together for 10 years
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.260]   and maybe they were in other relationships
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.600]   and they both got divorced, commiserated with each other
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.940]   and they get together.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.720]   And it's like, we've known each other for 10 years.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.240]   We're gonna have a great relationship.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.480]   And they find out this is like a stranger almost
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.240]   because it's a close relationship now.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.520]   And that's the difference.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.640]   How people behave in a close relationship
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.480]   often triggers like personality disorder stuff,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.600]   fear of abandonment, fear of looking inferior,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.240]   fear of being dominated, fear of not getting
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.200]   enough attention.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.600]   The personality disorders seem to have excessive fears
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.900]   in these areas.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.000]   - Is it fair to say that if somebody has a lot
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.400]   of stable friendships over long periods of time,
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.620]   that that's a good indication
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.680]   that they can maintain close relationships?
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.540]   But it seems to me you'd also wanna know like,
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.100]   what is a close friend to that person?
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.000]   Do they actually spend time with them?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.480]   And likewise with coworkers.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.020]   Because some work environments that I've been in
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.620]   are necessarily very non-personal.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.140]   You don't share much, right?
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.420]   Whereas other environments,
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.820]   like I know the partners of everyone I work with now
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.980]   at the podcast, that wasn't true for my academic colleagues.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.180]   I knew some of my academic colleagues' families,
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.220]   I would have dinner with them, et cetera,
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.820]   but some of them less so.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.820]   So context matters a lot, right?
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.420]   - Yes, and I'd say, you mentioned the word stability,
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.220]   and that's really a key.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.620]   So if they have close friends they've had for 10, 20,
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.280]   30 years, that's a really good sign.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:41.580]   Bad signs are, I don't want you talking to my family,
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.020]   they're evil people, they'll say terrible things about me,
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.740]   you can't trust them, they'll end up, they'll turn on you,
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.380]   they'll hate you, all this stuff.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.300]   So you can't even ever talk to my,
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.720]   I can't even let you know who my family is
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.980]   and what their emails and phone numbers are.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.820]   - Oh, goodness.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.700]   - That's a warning sign.
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.740]   - Yeah, definite warning sign.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.700]   Because everyone has conflict with family members
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.260]   at some level, but you would hope that one
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.220]   would feel comfortable allowing you
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.740]   to interact with their family.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.040]   - Yeah, and if your family's really difficult,
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.980]   introduce your partner to your family,
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.500]   let them see, this is a difficult family
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.560]   and this is why I had to distance from them.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.580]   'Cause a lot of people, to be healthy,
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.060]   do have to get some more distance.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.720]   But it's the secretiveness, it's the,
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.640]   just secrets in general are not a good thing
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.180]   for relationships, that's the biggest piece
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.780]   that's missing in a way compared to 50 years ago
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.100]   when people knew, it was hard to have family secrets.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.780]   50 years ago, now, even though people may be
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.980]   all over the internet, you might really know their secrets.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.320]   And that's what you need to find out.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.580]   - What about advocates?
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:02.580]   So, I'm familiar with some high-conflict individuals.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.500]   Some are more of the combative type,
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.540]   others are more of the kind of, what did you call it,
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.780]   sort of a quiet, manipulative, victim-playing type.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:16.780]   And both seem to be pretty good at generating advocates.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.260]   I guess you call these negative advocates,
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.280]   people that will fight for them.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.220]   By the way, this is all sounding a lot like modern politics.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.420]   - Yes.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.340]   - And maybe we'll get into that a little bit
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.060]   because it is an important reflection
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.420]   on what we're talking about.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.660]   But what about these negative advocates?
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.460]   If somebody has a lot of friends or advocates
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.540]   that they are kind of like on their side against,
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.380]   that are also in a blame mode.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.300]   - Yes.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.380]   - Is that a red flag?
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.220]   - Yes.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.060]   What's interesting, and I'd like to someday
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.980]   learn more of the neuroscience behind this,
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.360]   but high-conflict people have heightened emotions.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.180]   The cluster B personality disorders
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.880]   are known as dramatic, emotional, and erratic.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.340]   That's the DSM-5TR says that,
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.200]   the manual for mental health professionals.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.140]   And so, their heightened emotions are contagious.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.180]   And in general, what I've learned about this work a lot
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.820]   is emotions are contagious
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.620]   and high-conflict emotions are highly contagious.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.380]   So what happens, and I see this so much as a lawyer
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:33.060]   and with other lawyers, and with therapists,
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:37.060]   is the high-conflict person comes into your office
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.780]   and says, "I've been terribly treated by,"
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:45.100]   let's say my ex, man or woman, 'cause it happens to both,
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.260]   "been terribly treated and you've got to save me.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.660]   "You've got to protect me.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.020]   "You've got to win.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.440]   "You've got to," sometimes they say,
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.140]   "You have to destroy the other party."
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.540]   That's always a warning sign
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.020]   when their goal is to destroy the other party.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.800]   It's not a good sign.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.620]   But they're so emotional, you say,
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.900]   "My goodness, this person's been through so much.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.420]   "Now I have the emotions."
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.100]   And what I teach in my seminars is,
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.100]   I understand it has a lot to do with the amygdala,
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:21.060]   that the amygdala catches the intense fear or tense anger,
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.900]   that those are heightened.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.940]   And so now mine's going,
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.860]   "Oh, Billy, you've got to do something."
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.900]   I'm like, my body wants me to take action.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.980]   And I want to save this person
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.340]   from their evil co-parent, for example.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.060]   And so what we see with negative advocates
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.460]   is they're emotionally hooked, but uninformed.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.260]   They don't really know what's going on.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.860]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   A court case with a high conflict person
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.940]   brought their whole family.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:01.020]   And I had a case with false allegations, terrible allegations.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.740]   My client happened to be the father.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.560]   The mother was making false allegations
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.940]   of child sexual abuse.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.820]   And I've had all types of true cases, false cases.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.340]   So this is a real problem, a real issue.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.300]   But there also were false allegations.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.020]   In this case, that's what was happening.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.060]   So the mother brings her whole family.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:28.740]   And the judge realizes what's going on in the case
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.340]   'cause of the evidence presented
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:34.860]   and sanctions the mother for knowingly false allegations.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.260]   - What does that equate to in the legal system?
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.860]   - So my client, the father,
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.860]   spent about $40,000 getting a psychological evaluation
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.060]   having a trial, doing all of this, attorney's fees.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.140]   And so the court made her pay $10,000
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.420]   of his attorney's fees and costs.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.460]   So that's what the sanction is.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.660]   And there's a code section
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.860]   that said knowingly false allegations of child abuse
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:07.380]   are a basis to make one party pay the other party's fees.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.360]   So she's ordered, she never paid it, by the way.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.720]   And she owned no property.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.900]   We weren't able to get it 'cause she had property
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.980]   in other people's names.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.980]   But the idea was that she brought her whole family there.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.220]   She brought her mother, mother's boyfriend.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:27.660]   She brought her roommate who was a psychology grad student
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.300]   who was like encouraging her,
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.420]   "Oh, your daughter's being abused.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.360]   "You've gotta do something."
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.620]   These were all negative advocates.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.700]   And when the judge made her ruling
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.300]   and spelled out the information, that was very clear.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.020]   I mean, we caught the mother lying.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.580]   She persuaded other people to lie for her.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.780]   We caught them in lie.
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.920]   So it was a really surprisingly open case.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.820]   And the family started yelling at the judge.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.420]   They said, "This is a crime and this is a shame."
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.300]   And blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.000]   The judge said, "You take yourselves
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.260]   "out of here immediately
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.900]   "or I will have the bailiffs take you out."
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.100]   And that they stood up and laughed and shouted,
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.620]   "This is an abomination," or something like that.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.740]   These were the negative advocates.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.420]   They didn't know what the full picture was.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:22.420]   They believed their family member who was a skilled liar.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.180]   I believe, and this is very interesting,
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.420]   I got to talk to her therapist, a therapist she had.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.020]   I was released to talk to her.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.220]   And the therapist, it was in the open,
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.200]   was she has borderline personality disorder.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.100]   And that was an open thing.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.940]   And the therapist said, "And there's something else."
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:48.260]   And I said, "Antisocial personality disorder?"
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.820]   And she said, "I can't say,
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.540]   "but I wouldn't disagree with you."
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.700]   - Which is effectively a yes.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.700]   - Yeah, and with antisocial,
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.780]   that's where you get a lot of lying and stuff like that.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.020]   It's a rare case,
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.220]   but since I have the social work background
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.300]   and I've had many true cases of child sexual abuse,
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.140]   especially as a therapist, I can see the difference,
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.660]   whereas a lot of lawyers don't know what to look for.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.820]   But this was an exceptional case,
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.020]   antisocial and borderline personality disorder.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.100]   She had a lot of traits.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.620]   And at first, the judge was very critical
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:29.340]   of my client and us, and he had supervised contact.
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.440]   But the supervisor said, this is fascinating,
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.700]   "When the child would be exchanged,
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.700]   "the girl would walk tentatively towards the father."
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.540]   The mother dropped her and left.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.260]   Supervisor brought her to the father.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.100]   She was kind of tentative.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.480]   She'd see the father, and she'd look.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.720]   The mother's out of sight.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.540]   She'd jump on him, laugh, and have a wonderful time.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.100]   - I do have one question.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.540]   It's not a litmus test question,
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.440]   but do you recall from the particular case
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.180]   you were just describing,
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.900]   whether the relationship had started very quickly?
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.460]   Had they moved in together quickly?
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.060]   Decide, excuse me, had they decided
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.340]   to have children together quickly, married quickly?
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:20.340]   In other words, was your client oblivious
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.280]   because of the rate at which he were moving?
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.340]   And the analogy that comes to mind is,
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.820]   if you're moving very fast, it's hard to read the road signs.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.220]   - I think he did.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.660]   And what's interesting is they got together
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.120]   when they were quite young.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.860]   I think maybe she was 18, he was 20, something like that.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.820]   - That's pretty young by today's standards.
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.780]   - And so excitement, new, all of that.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.540]   I'm pretty sure they did.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:50.540]   And what's interesting is they had gotten divorced.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:55.560]   The issue I described was an after-divorce custody issue.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.220]   But they had gotten divorced maybe four or five years
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.820]   into their marriage, and she assaulted him.
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.380]   And he had the scars and all of this.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.620]   So he had actually custody of this girl
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.020]   who was eight years old when the story
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.140]   I just told you happened, which is also helpful
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.020]   'cause she was verbal, she could describe.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.160]   She actually described how her mother coerced her
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.540]   to say things that weren't true.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.320]   But yeah, so they got together young, I think quick.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.380]   Then they got divorced, but the patterns continued.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.460]   And that's one thing we see, a lot of high-conflict divorces
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:35.140]   keep going even after the divorce.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.260]   The actual divorce date is like a speed bump
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.780]   in the lifetime of high-conflict
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.720]   if they have children together.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.860]   - Hence the wait to have children
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.780]   with somebody if possible.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:53.020]   You asked about emotional contagion
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.400]   and you made reference to the science.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.660]   If I may, I'll just share something
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.600]   that might be of interest to you and to the listeners.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.340]   You're certainly right that the amygdala
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.980]   is a central hub for threat detection.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.400]   What a lot of people don't know,
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.860]   because it's just not discussed enough
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.820]   in the popular coverage of neuroscience
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.500]   is that the amygdala can learn in the sense
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.900]   that it's highly prone to context-dependent plasticity.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.420]   So this idea that getting emotionally charged
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.660]   is either negative valence, like fear,
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.040]   or positive valence, like, "Oh, I like that."
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.780]   That's true to an extent, but over time,
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.300]   the brain changes to, in some cases,
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.780]   like the feeling of adrenaline
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.260]   to get an associated dopamine release with that.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.300]   But a really interesting set of brain structures
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.540]   that aren't discussed enough, I'll just mention,
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.740]   'cause you asked about neuroscience.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.340]   I had a postdoc in my laboratory
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.820]   by the name of Hee Kyung Jung, a fantastic postdoc,
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.620]   who was looking at emotional contagion.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.260]   We were interested in human subjects,
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.500]   but these were animal studies.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:00.500]   By one member of a species is observed
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.740]   and then mimicked by another member of the species,
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.500]   a very powerful aspect to human and non-human behavior.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.260]   And there's a structure in the brain called the claustrum.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.180]   Most people don't know about it,
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.480]   which seems to be critical for this.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.900]   And she did a beautiful set of experiments
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:19.620]   of showing that when animals observed other animals,
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.420]   either in a positive or a fear state,
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.060]   but in this case, a fear state,
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.740]   they would, or a threatened state,
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.700]   their own claustrum to anterior cingulate cortex circuitry,
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.000]   and of course, amygdala, et cetera,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.380]   those would light up as if they were in the experience,
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.980]   but not to the same degree.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.160]   But over time, what one could see
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.180]   was a kind of a heightening, a plasticity of these circuits,
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:43.700]   so that smaller threats
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.180]   started to create larger internal responses.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.780]   That's both combining Hee Kyung's work
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.700]   and other work that's come out since.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.660]   So what it says is that our brains
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.720]   are very tuned to the emotional states of others.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.860]   This is good, empathy, for instance,
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.700]   but that over time, we can,
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:05.700]   our brains change to actually require a lower stimulus
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.300]   to activate that kind of negative advocate part of ourselves.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.140]   - Yes.
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.460]   - And so perhaps this is a good segue into a discussion
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.240]   about what we're observing societally now,
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.620]   not just in terms of politics,
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.880]   but it's one thing to be recruited to a camp,
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.180]   but then once you're in the camp,
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.440]   it turns out, if we think about
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.740]   through the lens of this work,
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.640]   it seems that it requires less negative stuff
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.980]   in order to stay in that camp,
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.100]   but want to fight more and more stridently
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.940]   in order to protect a cause.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:36.780]   Does that make sense?
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.020]   - I think exactly.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:41.060]   And as I mention in my book about bullies,
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.300]   I think polarization really demonstrates that.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.940]   So once you're in your group
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.200]   and you see the other group
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.380]   as not only having a different point of view,
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.420]   but as the enemy,
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.100]   then your brain doesn't need to work on it anymore.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.580]   That's case closed.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.820]   They're the enemy.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.660]   The only question is, what do we do now?
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.500]   And the research saying that
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.700]   when you talk to the people in your group,
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:15.260]   rather than coming together, you move farther apart.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.700]   And to me, what's fascinating in terms of legal cases,
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.980]   and especially in family law,
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.120]   is you have, like the family I described,
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.340]   you have the family talking to each other.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.500]   You pull a lawyer into that.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.160]   The lawyer talks to them.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.780]   The lawyer gets heightened anger, maybe,
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.820]   or commitment to save this person.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.580]   And maybe you get a therapist into the picture,
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.260]   and they all just talk to themselves.
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.660]   They pull farther and farther apart.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.300]   And that's often when we have our high-conflict court case.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.900]   They come back to court every six to 12 months,
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.100]   sometimes for years.
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.100]   I have cases where people have been in court
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.860]   like every year for eight or nine years.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:02.020]   And these are cases where the divorce was done long ago.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.420]   What people don't realize is the worst custody disputes
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.380]   tend to happen after the divorce is over.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   And I think it's because people are spending
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.100]   more and more time talking to their own team,
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.340]   to their own group, and that pulls them farther apart.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:21.340]   Their view of the other side is worse and worse and worse.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:26.460]   And that's why I think the structure really matters.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:30.900]   So I think politically, we have these two different
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:34.220]   universes that don't necessarily talk to each other,
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.540]   and they really create a sense of community.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.940]   People are looking for community, and they find it.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:43.860]   But it's fed by, I think, the media ecosystem.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.980]   Everyone has their own media.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.460]   And so we have these two universes talking to themselves,
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:53.380]   growing farther and farther apart.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.540]   And that's why elections don't seem
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:57.620]   to have made a difference in any of this,
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.420]   'cause elections kind of decides who does government,
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:05.220]   but they don't resolve the adversarial communities.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.060]   And they get a lot of attention.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.140]   And sad to say, I think our culture has shifted
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:15.660]   from government, that politics is about government,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.140]   and the details and nitty gritty,
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:22.100]   and the values of government are what's good for our group,
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.060]   good for our country, unity, citizenship,
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.900]   we should be together in this,
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.100]   that politics have shifted to entertainment.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.800]   The values of entertainment are be extreme, be emotional.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.100]   And entertainment's driven by drama,
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.060]   for thousands of years.
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:48.500]   And drama is opposing us against them.
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.380]   And as I mentioned in the "Bullies" book,
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.300]   there's a terrible crisis, there's an evil villain,
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.140]   and there's a superhero.
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:00.060]   And if you have someone tell that story to their community,
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.940]   they will love that person.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.300]   So now we have two communities in politics
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:09.980]   loving themselves and hating the other.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.160]   And the elections don't resolve that.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.580]   That's a speed bump on the road to high conflict.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.060]   And that's not a good sign,
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.700]   and we have to find ways to bridge the gaps.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.740]   And there are ways.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.600]   You get people one-to-one talk to each other.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.500]   There's a lot of groups trying to say,
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.140]   let's connect rather than separate.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.180]   And if we get too far out of balance,
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.620]   we're gonna have bigger and bigger high conflict problems.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.660]   So we have to, the more people's eyes
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.300]   are open to this pattern, the more they can say,
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.740]   hey, I seem to be part of this group,
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.740]   but I wanna, my neighbors think differently.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.580]   I'm gonna listen to them.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.820]   It's listening that's missing.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.940]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.660]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.300]   I recently became a Function member
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.580]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:00.600]   to lab testing.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.500]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.500]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.100]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.980]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.780]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.020]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:18.420]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.180]   Function not only provides testing
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.620]   of over a hundred biomarkers
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.280]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.140]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.700]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.540]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.660]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.980]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.780]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.660]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.140]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.820]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.140]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.900]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.260]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:55.140]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.220]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.980]   and detoxification, and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.540]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:03.940]   is so important for health.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.740]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.660]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.140]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.040]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.580]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.500]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.900]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.140]   And I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.460]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.740]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.340]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.940]   but they're offering early access
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.180]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.460]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.500]   to get early access to Function.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by David.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.120]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.080]   It has 28 grams of protein,
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.600]   only 150 calories, and zero grams of sugar.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.420]   That's right, 28 grams of protein,
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.580]   and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.140]   This is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.700]   These bars from David also taste incredible.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.260]   My favorite bar is the cake-flavored one,
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.220]   but then again, I also like the chocolate-flavored one,
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.460]   and I like the berry-flavored one.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.020]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.820]   They're all incredibly delicious.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.860]   Now, for me personally,
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.520]   I try to get most of my calories from whole foods.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:16.340]   However, when I'm in a rush, or I'm away from home,
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.540]   or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack,
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.620]   I often find that I'm looking
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.500]   for a high-quality protein source.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.820]   And with David, I'm able to get 28 grams
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.620]   of high-quality protein with the calories of a snack,
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.660]   which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:31.340]   of one gram of protein per pound of body weight,
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.680]   and it allows me to do so
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.780]   without taking on an excess of calories.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.860]   As I mentioned before, they are incredibly delicious.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:38.560]   In fact, they're surprisingly delicious.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.940]   Even the consistency is great.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.680]   It's more like a cookie consistency,
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.440]   kind of a chewy cookie consistency,
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.540]   which is unlike other bars,
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.080]   which I tend to kind of saturate on.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.460]   I was never a big fan of bars until I discovered David bars.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.820]   If you give them a try, you'll know what I mean.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.060]   So if you'd like to try David,
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.180]   you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:00.200]   Again, the link is davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   On the suggestion of my friend
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.960]   and former guest on this podcast, two-time guest,
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.240]   Rick Rubin, I started watching a documentary
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.040]   about the history of professional wrestling,
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.440]   which everyone agrees is made up.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.260]   So let's just acknowledge that, I recognize that.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.840]   But it's a remarkable portal
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.480]   into some of the things that you're talking about
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.560]   because it all hinges on being able
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.740]   to create emotional responses in the crowd,
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:30.360]   and just a very brief history of it, as I understand,
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.520]   and I'm by no means an expert,
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.240]   but I took notes on this documentary as I do,
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.740]   take notes on most everything.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:40.000]   They used to have good guys and bad guys,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.880]   good gals and bad gals, you know,
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.480]   'cause it's men and women's wrestling,
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.200]   typically not against each other, although sometimes.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.200]   In any case, there was a transition that occurred
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.080]   at some point where they couldn't get more excitement
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:57.040]   and literally couldn't get more attention to the sport
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.240]   by having good guys and bad guys, good gals and bad gals.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.840]   So what they ended up doing was making everybody bad.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.800]   And the ratings just skyrocketed, everybody bad, right?
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.880]   The underlying premise being that both teams are cheating,
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.760]   and so therefore they had to behave poorly also.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.000]   And it created this whole era of just bad people
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.280]   doing bad things,
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.600]   generating even greater emotional responses.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.060]   And this fits very much with the neuroscience of emotion.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:33.800]   Emotions like awe, happiness, joy, meaning, pleasure,
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.840]   these are powerful emotions.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.320]   And I will not say,
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.840]   because there's no data to support the idea that fear,
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.120]   anger, being threatened, et cetera,
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.620]   are more powerful emotions,
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.400]   but they tend to drive more behavior to,
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.720]   in other words, people will do more,
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.020]   this is well-known in the field of behavioral economics too,
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.000]   people will do more to avoid losing something
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.920]   than they will to gain something, sadly,
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.720]   but this is how our species is wired for evolutionarily.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.240]   - Evolutionarily, yeah.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.880]   - Meaningful reasons.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.280]   So the point being that I think societally
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.400]   and perhaps interpersonally,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.880]   because the two things mimic each other at every level,
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.980]   individuals all the way up to culture,
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:14.160]   seem to be engaged in this
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.200]   like increasingly amplified emotional states.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   And now it just seems like combat is the rule of the day.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.780]   And it's so sad,
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.200]   and you kind of have to wonder where it goes next.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.640]   But it does seem like it rewards
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.280]   these high conflict personalities
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.740]   because they go undetected, right?
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.600]   So now the coworker who's super angry
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.060]   about something they saw on the news
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.800]   and is trying to engage people or something
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.920]   or create an issue around something that like,
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.240]   is this really an issue?
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.960]   I mean, there's some real issues in the workplace
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.560]   and at school, but like, is this really an issue?
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.880]   Like that person 10 years ago,
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.320]   everyone would have been like,
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.480]   this is a problem person and would have backed away.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.720]   Now it just kind of, because the mean has shifted,
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.800]   I think it goes, it's no longer signal above the noise.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.360]   It's as we say in science, within the noise.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.280]   - Right.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.280]   Well, what we're seeing is these kind of media systems,
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:13.000]   I call them, are attracted to high conflict personalities
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.660]   and high conflict personalities are attracted to attention.
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.080]   They want attention.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.600]   So there's this almost marriage of media exposure
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.080]   and high conflict personalities.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.080]   And so that's what pulls people together.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.720]   I think everyone's looking for community these days.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.680]   And it used to be around work, like a shared task,
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.000]   but now we do so much of our work alone or tiny groups.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.020]   And so you get a real sense of community.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:47.240]   People used to get it from church or synagogue
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.320]   or mosque, wherever, and that's weakened.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.640]   And so we get that now a lot,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.680]   the intense emotional community from politics.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.200]   And so there's a community for you
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.240]   and there's a community for you.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.240]   So they pull themselves together.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.440]   They get that, I don't know, dopamine hit
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.520]   or whatever it is, and strengthens them.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.360]   So what's happening is we're pulling apart.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.440]   But to me, the answer is exposing the patterns
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:20.880]   and understanding our brains is recognize what's happening.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.720]   This person's probably exaggerating
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.160]   when they say that those people are evil.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.200]   This person's probably exaggerating
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.520]   when they say those people are stupid.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.880]   Whatever it is that we have to realize,
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.680]   okay, don't buy that completely.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.040]   And what's fascinating to me, I don't know how it happened,
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.960]   but I get text message solicitations
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.960]   to contribute to campaigns from conservatives and liberals.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.480]   I get both, and guess what?
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.960]   They look like each other.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.520]   And they're like, the end of the world is coming.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.640]   You've gotta give $10 or $100 to save the world.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.920]   And the end of the world's coming because of them.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.920]   - It's all fear-based.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.240]   - And it's fear-based, but it hooks your emotions.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.000]   I know this stuff, so I can go,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.560]   okay, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe away.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.160]   But a lot of people don't know that this is happening.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.800]   They don't understand how emotions are contagious
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   and how I think high-conflict emotions are more contagious.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.960]   So to me, it's educating people about these dynamics
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.520]   so you don't engage so much with them.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.320]   Like, I won't watch more than a half an hour of TV news,
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.080]   but you can have 24/7 TV news.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.080]   And since 1995, 1996, when they allowed,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.600]   they gave you licenses for radio and television
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.200]   that didn't have to tell the other side of the story.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.160]   Before that, you used the fairness doctrine.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.200]   You have to say what the other side is.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.280]   You're for a candidate,
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280]   you have to hear it from the other side.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.680]   You didn't have to after 1995, '96.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.680]   So we had MSNBC and Fox News slightly off-center,
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.540]   slightly conservative, slightly liberal.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:17.660]   Well, now we've had 30 years of that, much farther apart,
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:21.340]   and communities around each of these.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.120]   And yet, if you go, okay,
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.020]   I'm probably hearing some exaggerations here.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.580]   So I can check myself.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.940]   And this person's trying to be a hero
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.580]   and demonize those people.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.180]   I'm not gonna do that.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.900]   So I'm not one for government regulation.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.840]   What I want is for everyone to be able to say,
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.920]   okay, I see what's happening.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.460]   I'm not gonna get my emotions hooked.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.820]   And I think, to me, that's one of the goals,
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.280]   is for people to learn,
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.860]   I don't have to absorb the emotions,
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.320]   'cause that's where the problem is.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.280]   People are emotionally hooked and uninformed.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.380]   - What are some of the signs of a high-conflict personality?
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:05.720]   Because in an ideal world, we avoid these people.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.740]   And again, we're not trying to say that they're bad people.
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.820]   Some of them are bad people, some of them aren't.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:12.780]   But since I'm not a clinical psychologist,
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.420]   you are, you can make the assessment,
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.500]   certainly better than I can.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:21.260]   What are some of the ways to avoid these circumstances
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.020]   besides the first-year rule?
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.340]   And then let's talk about some ways
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.740]   to disentangle from these people
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.400]   based on their unique phenotypes.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.120]   So is there a question or set of questions
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.300]   one should ask themselves
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.820]   when they are potentially dating someone,
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.340]   potentially becoming friends with somebody,
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.860]   potentially becoming coworkers with somebody, and so on?
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.300]   - Yeah, so what's interesting
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.620]   is often your gut feeling tells you something's up here.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.340]   Like the person suddenly has a shocking opinion
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.920]   of somebody else.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.520]   They say, you know, that person's a total jerk,
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.060]   and yet you know that person,
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.300]   and they're not a total jerk.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.220]   They suddenly, something's disproportionate.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:09.220]   I think disproportionate emotions is often a trigger.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.020]   I put in a lot of my books now
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.060]   what I call the web method,
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.780]   is pay attention to their words,
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:22.060]   your emotions, and their behavior.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.860]   So starting with words,
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.300]   do they use a lot of blaming words?
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.720]   You know, it's all that person's fault.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.700]   Do they use all or nothing words?
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.420]   They seem to see things through a narrow lens,
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.140]   that, you know, there's all good, there's all bad.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.360]   Unmanaged emotions, which they may or may not show,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.500]   like I explained.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.480]   Some people are good at hiding all that,
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.120]   even though it drives them inside.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.640]   And the extreme behaviors.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.840]   Do they do things 90% of people would never do?
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.420]   And I'll give an example here.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:02.280]   And this is, I won't say the city,
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.660]   but there was a mayor,
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:08.320]   there was someone who was a congressperson,
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.680]   and they decided to run for mayor in their city,
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.880]   instead of flying to go to Congress.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.720]   But when they were flying to go to Congress
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.200]   back and forth, this is in California,
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.460]   I'll say that much. (laughs)
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.880]   People can easily research this.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.840]   So this person, flying back and forth,
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.360]   one day, one night, standing,
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.520]   you know, there was a line to get your bags
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.600]   at the airport after you got off the plane.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.680]   And he was told to wait in line to get his bags.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.760]   And he said, "Don't you know who I am?"
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.320]   And he pushed his way to the front of the line,
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.440]   and had an argument with the person behind the counter,
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.360]   said, "Don't you know who I am?
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.760]   "I want my bag right now."
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.280]   And she said, "We don't have it now,
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.960]   "you can't have it right now."
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.760]   And he pushed her and knocked her over.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.920]   He shoved this airline worker behind the counter
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.080]   and knocked her over.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.640]   - This was a mayor of a major--
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.200]   - Not yet, he wasn't mayor yet.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.760]   He was a congressperson.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.840]   Anyway, so that means he's-- - Sorry, sorry.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.320]   No, knock it, I know some very decent congresspeople,
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.260]   but like, okay.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.060]   - Yeah, but so he's a-- - Well, in any case, right?
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.360]   This person could be any number of different professions.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.520]   - Could be, yes.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.040]   - Yeah, this is antisocial behavior.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.640]   - But this is a high-profile person.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.960]   So this is all over the news the next day.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.720]   This is 20 years ago, maybe, 15 years ago,
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.000]   something like that.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:37.960]   - Goodness.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.160]   - Anyway, so it's in the newspaper the next day.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.800]   A newspaper says, "Congressman so-and-so
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.640]   "gets into physical altercation with airline worker."
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640]   Knocks her over.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.560]   Half the people said, "That's terrible."
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.000]   And the other half the people said, "Wait, wait.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.040]   "He was sleep-deprived.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.120]   "He was flying across country.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.440]   "You have to understand that he was stressed."
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.640]   And here's where my web mythic comes in.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.200]   90% of people would not have done that
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.360]   even if they were sleep-deprived,
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.960]   and I fly back and forth a lot, and I'm not,
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.320]   I don't do that.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.760]   - I would like to think 99% of people
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.800]   wouldn't do that. - I think you're right.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.640]   - Right. - 99%.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.680]   - To get physical with an airline person over a bag?
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.720]   - The cutting to the front of the line is egregious.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.240]   The shoving the airline person is like beyond the pale.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.280]   So this is, so anyway, so he's running for mayor,
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.340]   and I'm going, "This guy's a high-conflict person.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:45.480]   "If he gets elected, he's not gonna be a very good mayor.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.000]   "He's gonna have a lot of trouble
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.840]   "with the people close to him."
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.720]   And so guess what happened?
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.980]   He gets elected.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:57.240]   Within, I think it's eight months,
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.880]   he is, and this is before the Me Too movement got started,
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.740]   but people are reporting he's harassing women,
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.200]   sexually harassing women.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.440]   Women come into his office to meet with him,
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.160]   professional, experienced, important,
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.280]   and he's wanting to touch them a lot.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.000]   Inappropriately, they don't wanna be touched.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.720]   Anyway, so women start complaining about him.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.680]   Word kinda gets out, yeah, this happened
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.060]   with a lot of different people,
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.260]   that he's not sexually assaulting them,
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.900]   but he's treating them badly.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.880]   - So it cuts across domains.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.220]   It's like in-- - Yeah, so--
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.440]   - So it's not just in the office.
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.840]   It's there, but it's also at the airport.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.840]   It's basically any time he's not getting what he wants,
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.360]   he throws a tantrum.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.060]   - And that's the thing with personality disorders
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.680]   is a narrower range of behavior
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.080]   that's repeated in a variety of settings.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.960]   - So he's fitting all of that.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.800]   So which personality disorder, I'm not gonna diagnose him,
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.640]   but it narrows down to one or two.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.040]   - So it's not context-dependent.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.720]   It is-- - Right.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.200]   - It's pervasive.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.320]   - Pervasive, and that word is in the diagnostic manual,
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.080]   that it's pervasive across, I think, several settings.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.240]   I think that's the words.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.300]   But let me just finish. - Yeah, please, please.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.840]   - 'Cause the end of the story, (laughs)
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.840]   the end of the story is he's also got committees
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.120]   and people that are supposed to accomplish things.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.640]   He doesn't want them to think.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.720]   He wants them to, he wants to do the thinking
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.000]   and tell them what to do.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.560]   So he goes around alienating a lot of people.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.560]   Within eight months, he's out of office
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.520]   because enough people were upset,
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.560]   and the way he got out of office
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:50.480]   is some of the heads of government told him,
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.920]   I think it was the city attorney or something,
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.880]   "If you quit now, we'll help you with your legal expenses,"
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.640]   'cause he's starting to get sued for some of this stuff,
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.560]   suing the city, suing him.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.560]   "We'll help you with your legal expenses if you quit now."
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.280]   And there was starting to be a petition movement
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.400]   for some, I don't know, the mechanics,
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.520]   like a special election or something to get rid of him.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.440]   Anyway, within eight months, he was out of the office,
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.800]   and now you don't hear about him in that city.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.600]   - It's a very interesting, literally high-profile,
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.840]   although still anonymous based on this conversation, case.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.760]   I wonder if on a more subtle or typical level,
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.640]   the following is informative or not.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.640]   I'm not looking for a validation
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.920]   of the example I'm about to give,
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.920]   but I've been very surprised at times
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.360]   how if a person who I'm with, for example,
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.000]   for the first time out on a meal
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.920]   will behave towards the wait staff.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.080]   - Yes.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.800]   - Not explicitly disparaging of them,
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.280]   but sometimes mildly disparaging of them,
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.160]   or feeling as if the amount of liquid
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.480]   poured into their glass was somehow an indication
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.120]   of how the waiter felt about them
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.720]   or didn't feel about them.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.200]   Like reading into these things
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.280]   where you're just thinking to yourself like,
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.880]   "Whoa, life must be really tough for you.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.800]   Who's paying attention to this stuff?"
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.120]   And so that's one that I've noticed in people,
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.400]   and it's proved informative.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.280]   - It's really a useful thing to see.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.320]   That's part of what you see, their behavior,
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.480]   and their behavior towards other people.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.120]   This was a brilliant thing.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.400]   I don't remember the name of the program,
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.900]   but there was a guy who was head of a company,
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.920]   and he used to, when he was interviewing people
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.000]   for high-level jobs,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.200]   he pretended he was a taxi driver or something,
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.560]   would pick them up at the airport as the taxi driver
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.920]   and see how they treated him as the taxi driver,
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.560]   and then he gets in the interview room,
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.760]   and he's the guy interviewing them.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.800]   And in some cases, people treated him really disrespectfully
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.040]   and it's like, "Now I know this is not someone I want."
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:09.880]   - Clever.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.760]   I made the decision to not work for somebody years ago
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.440]   when I was on a very different stage in my career
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:23.160]   based on how that person treated a janitor.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.000]   - Yeah.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:24.840]   - And it was amazing
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.880]   because it was one very brief interaction.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.920]   And it wasn't like this person yelled at the janitor.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.760]   It was the dismissiveness.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.680]   - Yeah.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.800]   - And I remember it was just your web approach.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.720]   It was his, I guess I just revealed,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.920]   it was his words towards the janitor.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.680]   It was my emotional response was sort of like,
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.560]   I felt like I had been kind of kicked in the stomach.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.400]   - Right.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.720]   - I was like, "Hey," like that was,
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.960]   like, it just felt like a very,
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.240]   what I would call like the football play,
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.640]   unnecessary roughness.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.480]   - Yes.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.900]   - It was mild from the perspective of like,
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:57.120]   no one got physical or called anyone names,
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.240]   but I remember thinking like, "Oh, like that sucked."
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.080]   - Right.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.440]   - And then their behavior was just to just go right back
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.200]   to what they were talking about.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.360]   And I knew in that moment, I was really crestfallen
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.280]   because in that moment I knew,
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.780]   "Oh my goodness, I can't work for this person."
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.620]   - Yeah.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.320]   - Like I just can't, and I made the decision not to,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.440]   and actually their response to my deciding not to
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.320]   for a variety of other reasons too,
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.640]   confirmed everything that I suspected
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.280]   in that one little interaction.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.120]   - Yes.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.480]   - But it's interesting because we're trained
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.480]   to collect data rather, you know, carefully,
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.080]   you know, and we don't wanna make snap judgment.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.920]   Somebody could truly be having a bad day,
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.120]   but in this case it was the right decision
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:40.960]   to not work for them.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.840]   Thank goodness, I thank my lucky stars.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.080]   I made some really bad decisions about people in my life.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.560]   That was a really good decision.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.280]   I never spent a day regretting it.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   And I went to work for someone else
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.640]   who was terrific instead.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.480]   - Great.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.000]   - So, but as you said,
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.540]   these things sometimes hit at a somatic level,
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:00.200]   as opposed to some sort of, wait, you know,
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.360]   some like very cerebral analytic thing.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.040]   It kind of hits at a, what must be a very primitive circuit.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.800]   I can't help the neuroscientist in me wants to say,
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.020]   like, it's gotta be something at the level of the body
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:16.520]   where we go, wait, that was messed up.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.360]   - Yeah.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.560]   - And you can't really point to a specific word.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.960]   And then you start to question yourself.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.800]   That's the problem you wonder was,
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.040]   well, maybe their tone wasn't,
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.760]   maybe it's my own perception, but I don't know.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.960]   Maybe the body doesn't lie.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.320]   Maybe it knows.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.480]   - I think the body is like a first responder
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.800]   and that we should pay attention to that.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.240]   And especially with high conflict personalities,
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.320]   especially the con artists,
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.240]   which is part of the antisocial personality,
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.480]   and the ones I've dealt with are very good at this,
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.040]   is their words are just right.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.760]   And your brain is like soothed by them.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.200]   You go, this person gets it and I'm totally comfortable.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.040]   They're charming, all of that.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.880]   And your gut goes, wait, they're out of sync.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.280]   I have this cold feeling.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.720]   Why do I have this cold feeling?
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   And I think that they're aimed at your cerebral thinking
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:17.320]   and that your guts kind of gets it
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.440]   because they're in a way predatory,
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.000]   like antisocial tend to be predatory.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.560]   - Those people have dead eyes.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.400]   I've known a few.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.240]   - Yeah.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.320]   - I've known a few men and women
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.160]   and their eyes are, I can only describe,
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.800]   and I'm a vision neuroscientist.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.600]   That's like what my career has been.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.760]   And those are two little pieces of brain right there.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.120]   And there's something about the deadness.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.000]   And I don't have a science to support what I'm about to say.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.160]   There's something about the deadness in their eyes.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.200]   Maybe their pupils don't change shape
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.400]   with levels of arousal the same way other people's do.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.880]   'Cause we know that happens in healthy,
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.840]   people with an unhealthy autonomic nervous system,
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.840]   but there's something lacking.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.680]   - Yeah.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.600]   - And people make up all sorts of theories online.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.560]   Like I'm not a big blinker.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.400]   I don't blink.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.800]   When I'm concentrating, blinks break up my flow.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.280]   And this is actually a way I can remember things.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.320]   People have these theories about blinking, non-blink.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.240]   The research doesn't support any relationship
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.380]   between blink frequency and personality.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.040]   They had this whole theory about Zuck too.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.320]   Like he doesn't blink, therefore he's whatever, he's a robot.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.700]   None of that holds up.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:21.400]   What does hold up, however, is this mismatch between words
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.220]   and the affect that it creates in us.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.060]   - Yeah.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.160]   - It's sort of like it sounds right,
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.480]   but it doesn't feel right.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.860]   I wish we understood more about this
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.020]   at the level of science.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.640]   - There are a lot of theories, not a lot of tools.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.280]   - Someday, I think, yeah.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.360]   - Yeah, the tools for measuring the stuff
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.400]   are getting better.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:44.320]   I wanted to ask you about other ways of just knowing
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.160]   if you're interacting with a high conflict person
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.580]   when the cues are more subtle.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.000]   Are there other things or examples of the web method
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.760]   that come to mind?
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.200]   - Well, for me, of course, dealing like with court,
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.140]   especially, there's a lot of stuff in writing.
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.220]   And so being able to look at what's written
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:09.540]   and a lot of blame words, the all or nothing words.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.860]   She did this and she did that.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.060]   And disparaging words, she's stupid or whatever.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:18.380]   Or he's a bully, he's this and that.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.060]   Which triggers for me, maybe he is,
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:23.100]   or maybe the person saying it is,
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.820]   but it heightens my attention.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.420]   - Yeah, how do you disambiguate between projection
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.260]   and a real thing?
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:33.100]   Like online now, I mean, one of the fastest ways
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.100]   to get a popular social media account
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.100]   is for somebody to give advice
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.700]   about how to avoid bad people.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.380]   You know, name calling, gaslighting, narcissist,
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.300]   sociopath, psychopath, history on it.
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.980]   Like these are clinical terms
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:53.300]   that now the general public can leverages
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.900]   to like, you know, sort of amplify community.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.780]   And then in part, I understand
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.020]   from talking to people on the tech side
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.460]   is that social media is social.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:03.300]   - Right.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.120]   - The accounts that grow fastest
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.980]   are the ones where you don't need much language
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:07.680]   to convey what you're trying to convey,
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:11.260]   like a sport or dance or an animal.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:15.320]   And among the others that grow very quickly
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.000]   and therefore rewarding to people
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   are ones where you're recruiting these negative advocates.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.300]   - First of all, I wanna make sure
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.700]   that I get this point across,
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.760]   and that is there's a lot of temptation
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.340]   to label people with like the mental disorders,
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:34.440]   the personality disorders.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:38.040]   And it's absolutely essential that people don't do that.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.180]   If you think somebody might be a narcissist
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:44.260]   or might have borderline personality or be antisocial,
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:48.500]   keep that to yourself and adapt how you work with them
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.880]   to be more effective or be more cautious, whatever.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.020]   But the worst thing I think is people say,
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.900]   oh, and everyone agrees that person's a narcissist,
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.500]   so we kind of gang up on that person.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.540]   That's not helpful.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:03.660]   The goal is not rejecting people.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.340]   The goal is adapting what you do
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.580]   to either manage the relationship,
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:12.440]   decide, okay, that's not someone I'm gonna get close to,
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.380]   but I can still work with them
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.000]   or have them as neighbors or whatever.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.540]   So I wanna emphasize that, 'cause I think you're right.
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.820]   There's a lot of that today.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.060]   And people come to me with that concern and say,
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.500]   Bill, you teach about personality disorders.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.580]   Yes, so people understand patterns of behavior
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.940]   and how to adapt your own behavior.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:37.020]   I'm not teaching people to label other people.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.740]   So that's real important.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.500]   - Yeah, people go to school for many years
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.480]   and do 3,000 plus clinical hours
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.340]   to learn how to do that, to do that properly.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.700]   It's like saying, it's like diagnosing anything, right?
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.700]   I mean, a dermatologist might be able to help diagnose
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.560]   a skin patch for potential cancer,
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.740]   but we're taught that we're not supposed
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.540]   to do that ourselves.
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:05.480]   - So we have to be cautious, but on the other hand, aware.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.300]   And the more you're aware of patterns,
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:12.020]   like being aware of someone with an alcohol abuse issue,
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.220]   is to go, okay, I'm not gonna be serving him alcohol
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:17.060]   with dinner, he's a great person,
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:20.700]   but I'm just gonna leave that out of the evening meal.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.860]   Adapt to what we do rather than judging them.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.220]   And I don't see people with personality disorders
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.760]   as lesser beings.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.760]   I see them as having a different set of behaviors
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.980]   that they acquired pretty much in childhood.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:36.260]   So I don't hold it against them.
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.040]   I may dislike their patterns of behavior,
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.300]   but I really don't hate people like that.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.780]   I've been a therapist with clients like that.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:48.340]   So I think our awareness needs to be there
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:51.220]   so we adapt how we work with people.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:56.220]   But I think the gut feeling is so important.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.220]   And as a therapist, I was trained,
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.740]   pay attention to your gut 'cause that's gonna help you
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:03.860]   with your clients.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:07.600]   And that's why the web method, their words, their behavior,
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.100]   but how I feel often gives me tips.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.340]   - You mentioned before, and I think it's really important
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:18.060]   to highlight that people's patterns of interactions
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.640]   across a lot of different domains,
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.420]   with the teachers in the school, with close family members,
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.100]   with the people that know them best at work,
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.700]   that these different types of relationships
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.380]   reveal a pattern.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:34.300]   And one of the things, just speaking from my own experience,
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:38.180]   is that I've tended to, where I've gone wrong,
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.140]   I've tended to overemphasize the importance
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.420]   of like a credential.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:49.280]   For instance, some of my past romantic relationships
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.580]   have been with people who are highly educated,
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:56.860]   some less higher education, all extremely smart people,
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:59.780]   some more formal, some less formal education.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.780]   But I think that I and other people sometimes
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.980]   will look at the CV of somebody.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.260]   And of course, that's not the only indication
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.380]   of their values, et cetera.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:15.380]   But, and to overemphasize, like, oh, well,
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.740]   they did difficult things in a difficult setting,
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:22.500]   and therefore must be a good person.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.080]   So would you say that these high-conflict personalities
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.180]   exist more or less in high-competition venues
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.320]   versus low-competition venues?
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.460]   I don't wanna make this about socioeconomic status.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.300]   Those things correlate, but all too often,
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:41.380]   we tend to do the kind of good-on-paper analysis
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.140]   and forget the, like, how do they actually
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:46.260]   measure up in real life.
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.900]   - Yeah, I would say, first of all,
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:52.420]   that we see high-conflict people in every occupation,
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.900]   in every culture, in every community,
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.740]   every economic status.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:01.780]   I think that, and I don't think there's research on this,
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.740]   but I think that healthcare and higher education
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:10.620]   are two fields where there's a slightly higher incidence--
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:12.740]   - Higher. - Of high-conflict people
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:17.100]   because there's a higher, oh, also, I would say churches,
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.500]   and we get consultations with churches sometimes,
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:24.300]   there's a high tolerance for behavior
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:26.460]   that's outside the norm.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.500]   - So you said higher education
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.220]   and healthcare in particular.
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.700]   - And I would say churches-- - Are you talking about
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.720]   physicians and universities?
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.300]   - Yes, yes, so--
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.980]   - Students and faculty and staff?
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:42.780]   - Yes, both, administrators sometimes,
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:45.860]   and I believe it's because of the higher tolerance.
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.700]   - Administrators, just kidding.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.380]   I'm blessed with good administrators.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.340]   I've been blessed with great administrators.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:55.460]   - Yeah, let me mention, I do a lot of consultation,
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.180]   and one of the things that people come to me about
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:02.500]   is people with little power bases,
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.560]   like department heads in universities.
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.740]   I remember one university I did a consultation with
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:15.260]   about a department head, and they were a medical school,
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.620]   and they had a high-conflict person
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.540]   high up in the structure who was really,
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.260]   I was told, damaging some of the students' careers
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.780]   because they looked at them cross-eyed
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.560]   or something like that, so they wouldn't write
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.460]   the kind of recommendation that they needed,
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.740]   and how can we deal with this person
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:39.900]   'cause they're embedded in their position,
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.140]   so gave them a variety of tips,
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.500]   but that's why I think people do need
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.260]   to have their eyes open in these fields,
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.260]   and I wanna add, since I'm talking about occupations,
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.980]   we see this a little bit more in non-profits
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:00.380]   and non-profit administrators because, again,
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:04.080]   non-profits are good people doing good things,
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.020]   but they have this higher tolerance
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.940]   for administrators with bad behavior
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.940]   because they're good people, and that blinds people to--
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.540]   - Because of the assumption they're good people
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.780]   or because the mission is good?
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:21.640]   - The mission is good, and they're invested in this mission,
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.100]   so they must be good.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.540]   - Do you think that's part of what got them there?
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:28.940]   - Yes, and the thing that's so tricky
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:31.980]   is everybody's somewhat unique,
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:35.640]   but also these are some recognizable patterns of behavior
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:38.240]   once you know to look for them,
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.180]   and this is something, we're doing much more
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:42.940]   in the workplace now, and employers wanna know,
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:46.320]   we wanna promote this person, is that a good or bad idea?
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.460]   Well, let's look at the patterns of behavior
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.960]   'cause once you put them in an embedded position,
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.680]   things are gonna be harder.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.000]   I've been approached by city councils.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.680]   They say, we've got somebody on our city council
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.560]   that's a high-conflict person, what do we do?
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.920]   Do we confront them?
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.800]   Do we publicly talk about them?
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.840]   All that stuff.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.640]   I say, neither of those is good.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:12.580]   Learn how to manage them until they move on,
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:15.760]   and they often do because people slowly go,
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.780]   we don't like working with this person.
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:20.160]   - It's really interesting.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.040]   You know, when I was a graduate student,
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.240]   there was a department chair in the department,
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.560]   big personality, like big personality,
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:33.040]   and I very quickly came to realize,
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.200]   also because I listened to the faculty
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.080]   that were under this person,
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.240]   that despite having this like big,
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.000]   like larger-than-life personality
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.040]   that you might initially like place into a category
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.960]   of, you know, like diagnosis or something,
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.160]   that this person was an incredibly strong advocate
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.080]   for the faculty, and they loved that,
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:59.280]   and he was really beloved, and I think rightfully so,
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.980]   you know, and, you know, at a surface level,
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.120]   might've rubbed a few people the wrong way.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.240]   I think as students, we were like, oh, whoa,
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.560]   like, you know, it was almost like,
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.880]   didn't quite know how to like respond to it,
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.200]   but you very quickly got the sense of like
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.720]   a real kind of paternal nature in this person.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.400]   So I point this out because sometimes
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:26.400]   these big personalities are really, truly benevolent.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.080]   Now, I'm not saying he was a perfect human being.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:28.960]   How could I know that?
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:29.800]   I don't know that. - Right.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.220]   - I didn't know him in all domains of his life,
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.440]   although I did know his family,
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.360]   and he seemed to have a great, strong family too.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.960]   But then by contrast, I'm thinking of the person
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.800]   I alluded to earlier, different department,
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.920]   different university, who was kind of like more meek,
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.640]   like certainly is more of the stereotypical lab scientist,
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:51.560]   but then, you know, there was this like interaction
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.600]   that I observed and I thought like, whoa,
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.740]   like that's really dreadful.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.040]   At least that's not an environment I wanna be in.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.800]   So sometimes these things don't match
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.920]   our initial impressions.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.560]   I raise this because sometimes we think big personality,
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.600]   AKA high conflict personality.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.240]   Sometimes we think, hey, kind of, you know, quieter,
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.040]   nerdy type, and they're actually quite dreadful.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.140]   So it doesn't always fit.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:20.240]   It's, and I think the problem with the internet,
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.880]   social media version of this, the typical version,
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   'cause there's some great social media internet stuff,
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.880]   podcasts, et cetera, is that we default to what we see
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:34.400]   and what we hear, but we don't really have the data.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.600]   - And we can get manipulated that way.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.040]   That's what's tricky,
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.280]   but you raised several important points.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:43.800]   I wanna respond to them all if I can remember them.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:48.800]   The first is that this is in many ways quite nuanced.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.140]   The key thing to look out for with high conflict people,
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.560]   a preoccupation with blaming others
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.900]   and not taking responsibility.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:59.580]   So you might have a big personality
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.500]   that's not a high conflict person.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.860]   You might have a me, quiet person
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:06.740]   who is a high conflict person.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:11.740]   So you can't go by what your eyes see and your ears hear.
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.840]   It's really a question of evidence.
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.520]   And that's why I think maybe I got into this
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.840]   after I became a lawyer, that there's no way
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:24.560]   to quickly know, although you may quickly suspect
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.600]   and then wanna look deeper.
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:29.720]   But I wanna give an example 'cause now that I seem
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.960]   to have criticized department heads and--
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.800]   - Well, I cited at least one that is really wonderful.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.560]   I've known some other great department heads.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.840]   I mean, there's some chairs that are just like,
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.900]   these are, first of all, as a department head,
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.900]   sometimes there's a slight salary increase.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.580]   Usually it's trivial.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.140]   These people don't do it for the money.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.140]   I have a good friend who's also been on this podcast
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.020]   who's a chair of neurosurgery at a major.
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:55.520]   I mean, these are people who they work their butts off
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.860]   to try and make conditions better for patients,
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.060]   for professors, for clinicians, for staff.
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.580]   I mean, I'm not just saying this.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.180]   I have no incentive for saying it.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.760]   These people don't control my life anymore.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.420]   Well, I suppose my chair of ophthalmology
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:11.560]   who's a wonderful person, it does, et cetera.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.840]   But the point is that there are some people
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.640]   that step up to the plate to lead
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.040]   that are really great leaders.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.440]   And these are just not the people
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.640]   that we're focusing on today.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.800]   - Right, right.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.840]   And so the thing I wanna emphasize
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:27.520]   that my favorite example is Steve Jobs.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.880]   Steve Jobs, I would say, hands down,
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.840]   was a high-conflict person.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.660]   - Famous for it.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.120]   - There was a guy in Silicon Valley
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.720]   who wrote a book, "The No A-Hole Rule."
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.700]   And he talked about Steve Jobs in there
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.140]   'cause he knew Steve Jobs.
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:42.300]   He was in Silicon Valley.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.980]   So I remember reading his biography,
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.820]   like 1,000 pages or whatever.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:52.820]   And what stood out to me was that he blamed people,
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:56.640]   sometimes all or nothing thinking.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:00.020]   They talked about his distortion--
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.540]   - Reality distortion field.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.660]   - Reality distortion field.
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:06.540]   And that's exactly what high-conflict people do.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.580]   They all or nothing thinking,
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.400]   "You gotta do this, you can do this."
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.780]   People say, "That's not possible.
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.900]   "It's physically impossible, Steve, you can't do this."
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.300]   And then he would push them.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:20.780]   And one example that stood out to me was touchscreen,
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:25.160]   glass that you touch and it knows where you are.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.120]   I think, and I may have it wrong,
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.520]   but from reading his autobiography,
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:34.520]   that he harangued Corningware Glass Company,
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.160]   Corning Company, something like that, to create that.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.200]   And they said, "You can't do it.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.520]   "It's not physically possible."
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:43.480]   He says, "Do it and do it in the next 90 days."
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.480]   And they did, they invented this thing
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:46.800]   that they probably would not have done
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.800]   unless he pushed them.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.180]   So high-conflict person,
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.640]   but I don't think he had a personality disorder.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.440]   People say, "Oh, he's an incredible narcissist."
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:59.440]   But personality disorder is characterized
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.160]   by lack of change, lack of self-awareness,
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.600]   lack of flexibility, and they shoot themselves in the foot
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.040]   and it interferes with their success.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.440]   He, I think, was close to that,
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.840]   but he had enough flexibility.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:17.620]   And he picked a team that pushed back on him
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.660]   and he liked that.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:23.920]   So he's an example to me of high-conflict person,
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.420]   probably not personality disorder,
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:29.720]   and successful because he probably had some traits
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.040]   of these personalities.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.480]   So what I see is you totally have to look for the evidence
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.840]   that you can't make an assumption.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.080]   But if your gut says, "Maybe something's off here,"
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.320]   pay attention to that, but look for the facts,
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.180]   talk to other people that know this person,
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:49.840]   see them in other situations,
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.440]   because there's incredible people like him
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.360]   that accomplish a lot of really good stuff
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.120]   that you don't wanna say, "Oh, we can't have him."
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.800]   Apple fired him in the 1990s
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.760]   and he seemed to learn from that.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.740]   He seemed to grow from that.
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:10.040]   People with personality disorders
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.960]   don't seem to grow and change,
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.480]   and that's their problem, they're stuck.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:18.160]   High-conflict people, they blame others.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:21.240]   If they have some traits, maybe you can do a workaround.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.800]   So there's many people in position.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:27.940]   Surgeons are one group I wanna mention briefly,
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:30.400]   because as a clinical social worker,
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:35.080]   I worked in hospitals and dealt with doctors a lot.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:40.080]   As a lawyer, I've represented doctors in their divorces.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.720]   Several, I think, are high-conflict people,
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.320]   but most aren't, and that's what I wanna say.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.600]   Most department heads aren't high-conflict people.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.040]   Most surgeons aren't high-conflict people,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.240]   even though they get a reputation for that.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.360]   Police is another area, military's another area,
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.920]   probably slightly higher incidence,
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:03.500]   because they're in a position
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.340]   where they can dominate and control people.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:08.620]   But most police aren't like that.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:12.260]   Most people in the military aren't high-conflict people.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:14.820]   They're professional people, they like their job,
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:16.820]   they know their job, they have empathy,
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:18.220]   they work with people.
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.460]   So even though some of these occupations,
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.580]   there's a higher incidence,
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:25.420]   and that's certainly true for lawyers, I think.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:28.740]   But most people, most lawyers aren't like that.
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.860]   Most lawyers I know are really committed to their work,
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:34.300]   really wanna help their clients.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:39.300]   So I wanna kinda be clear that this is nuanced stuff,
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.720]   but when you're hiring people,
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.660]   when you're getting into a dating relationship,
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:47.480]   you wanna watch more closely,
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.780]   because it's the close relationships
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:53.100]   where high-conflict behavior comes out more.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:56.120]   - So the web method seems like a very good method,
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.260]   as well as paying attention to,
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:01.120]   and maybe getting some information from other people
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:04.740]   close to that person in different domains of their life.
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:09.180]   That seems like a very sage way to approach this.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:12.980]   - Exactly, and because when you hear from different people
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.540]   the same problem, then that should raise your antenna.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:18.900]   Okay, a lot of people say,
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.100]   "Yeah, but this person can be really irritable."
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:23.900]   And you go, "Okay, oh, they're irritable
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:25.620]   "in different settings.
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.140]   "I'm gonna think about that."
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:32.500]   - What about when somebody is already involved
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:36.680]   with a high-conflict person, and they want to disentangle?
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.140]   I could imagine a couple different scenarios.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:45.140]   Let's say disentangle from a professional relationship,
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:48.220]   disentangle from a personal relationship.
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:50.900]   Probably some overlap there, but slightly different.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:52.760]   Let's assume the high-conflict person
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.220]   is a high-conflict victim type.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.180]   Then let's compare that to if the high-conflict person
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:03.620]   is more of a combative type.
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.660]   Maybe we'll start with the combative type.
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:07.220]   So if you're dealing with a combative,
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:10.080]   maybe even, dare we say, narcissistic type,
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.540]   I don't know that we should diagnose,
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:15.000]   but the stereotype that comes to mind,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.620]   somebody that gets angry
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:19.980]   when you don't fulfill their expectations,
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.860]   and blames others, does not take responsibility,
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.660]   and it's time you decide to,
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.060]   like the Homer Simpson meme,
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.060]   kind of drift back into the hedge.
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.100]   Is that the way to do it?
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.700]   Or do you lay a clear line and say,
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:37.640]   "Listen, I'm not gonna tolerate this anymore.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:38.980]   "I'm out."
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:40.540]   - It's really somewhat dependent
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:43.440]   on the nature of relationship.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.020]   I do a lot of consultation.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:48.080]   We do a lot of training with high-conflict institute.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.380]   So we get married people getting divorced.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:54.540]   We get business partnerships
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:56.660]   where there's one partner that they're going,
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:58.700]   "We gotta deal with this."
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:01.580]   We have employees trying to get away
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:05.200]   from a high-conflict supervisor,
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.140]   and we have supervisors trying to deal
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.660]   with a high-conflict employee.
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:12.940]   So there's slightly different settings.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:14.640]   - You know, the most common situation
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.720]   is gonna be where somebody has a friend
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.380]   or a romantic partner
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:23.780]   or a business professional partner they wanna get out of.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:24.940]   So I suppose any of those.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:27.580]   - A close, so a partner kind of relationship.
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.380]   - Something where the person expects to hear from you
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:33.460]   on a fairly regular basis, expects things from you.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:35.520]   Could be professional things, could be personal things,
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.060]   but where there's an ongoing expectation
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:41.820]   that you show up emotionally, physically,
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:44.100]   financially, whatever.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.600]   - Yeah, so first of all, we strongly recommend
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.960]   against the direct hit, is don't tell the person,
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.540]   "Look, you do this, this, this, and this,
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:57.000]   "and that's terrible, and I don't wanna be,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.360]   "I don't wanna work with you,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.480]   "I don't wanna be in a relationship with you,
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:04.700]   "I don't wanna be close to you because of your behavior."
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:09.000]   That high-conflict people puts them through the roof.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.400]   They will defend themselves,
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.380]   and for the next months or years,
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:17.680]   they may put you in litigation,
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.680]   they may stalk you depending on your relationship.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:26.040]   They will hate you for that.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.040]   - They'll blame you.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.840]   - They will blame you, and that fulfills their picture
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.880]   that it's all your fault.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:36.580]   And now, look, you have violated the most basic thing,
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.560]   is that you will never blame me.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:42.160]   So don't blame them.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.920]   Second thing is, don't blame yourself,
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.000]   because that reinforces to them.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.880]   Like if you say, "You know, I just can't,
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.880]   "you know, I'm a sensitive person,
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.760]   "and I just can't keep up with you.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.460]   "I know I'm defective,
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:03.460]   "and I know I'm no good at this, this, and this,
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:07.460]   "and so I just have to end this relationship,
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:09.720]   "and I so much apologize.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.100]   "It's all my fault, you know, I do everything wrong,
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.020]   "and I'm gonna go really look at myself
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:18.300]   "and get some therapy, and I'm so sorry,
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:22.020]   "but I just can't, you know, keep up with you.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:25.740]   "You're such a really good this, this, and this,
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:28.720]   "and I just can't keep up with that."
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.100]   Well, they're gonna blame you for that,
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.860]   and you're, depending on their personality,
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.780]   if they tend to have borderline traits,
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:37.860]   they're gonna feel abandoned by you.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.460]   They have narcissistic traits,
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:42.960]   they're gonna feel put down by you.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.300]   They're gonna, 'cause you're supposed
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:46.260]   to see them as superior.
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:48.420]   If they have antisocial traits,
[01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:51.380]   they're gonna feel like, "Wait a minute, you know,
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.680]   "you're supposed to be submissive to me,
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.860]   "and yet you're walking away."
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.880]   So you don't wanna blame yourself.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.780]   So you're gonna go, "Well, what's left?"
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:04.740]   What's left is we aren't a good fit,
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:08.400]   our goals have gone in different directions,
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.520]   I'm really ready for a career change,
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.180]   I wanna go back to school, or, you know,
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:22.100]   I just realized I'm not ready for a committed relationship.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:24.980]   So it's not about you, and it's not about them,
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:26.580]   it's not about blame.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.660]   You wanna try to keep it away from blame.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:33.420]   Now, some people say it's dishonest
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:36.020]   to not tell them everything.
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:39.420]   And let's talk about brutal honesty.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:42.300]   High-conflict people really love brutal honesty,
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:44.340]   and they'll tell you, "I'm just being honest,
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:47.460]   "you're stupid, or a jerk, or whatever."
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.380]   That's high-conflict people.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:52.420]   Reasonable people don't tell everybody
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:54.200]   every negative thing they think.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:57.340]   That's just not healthy for relationships.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:02.020]   So it's okay to say, you know,
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.300]   "We seem to be going in different directions,"
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.540]   or, "I have different plans,
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.640]   "I've realized I wanna change."
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:11.140]   So those are basic principles.
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:15.600]   The worst thing in ending a relationship
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.020]   or reducing contact is to go back and forth.
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:24.820]   The worst thing is to pour out your feelings to the person.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.140]   I had this, people getting divorced,
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:29.060]   and they tell them, "I'm so sorry,
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:31.660]   "and I love you so much," and it was that.
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.220]   Pouring out your feelings to someone
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.500]   brings them closer to you.
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:40.060]   So you wanna start holding back some,
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:42.380]   and the other person say, "Well, let's work,
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:45.120]   "let's go to counseling, let's do this."
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.220]   And if you're not sure, go to counseling, I recommend that.
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.520]   But if you're sure, just say,
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:53.740]   "You know, I'm kind of not there anymore.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.480]   "I really need to be more on my own."
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.940]   So don't go back and forth,
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.140]   'cause that really makes it raw,
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:06.100]   and sometimes presages violence in divorces.
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:09.780]   A high-conflict person,
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:13.780]   especially with some of the personality disorder traits,
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.400]   can't handle the opening and closing, opening and closing.
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:21.700]   But the other thing, as I say, do it in steps
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:24.400]   so the person can adjust.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.400]   You might say, "I'm thinking about making a career change,"
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.300]   or, "I'm thinking that maybe this relationship
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:37.120]   "isn't the right one for me anymore."
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.300]   So the person gets used to the idea
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.340]   this may be coming to an end.
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:45.840]   And then, "I'd like to move out,
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.660]   "and have more time alone to think."
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.060]   And then, you're at a safe distance,
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:56.080]   and you say, "I've thought about it,
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.640]   "and we really need to get divorced.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.800]   "And let's go to a divorce mediator.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.200]   "I wanna be amicable.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:04.120]   "I don't hate you.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:05.880]   "In many ways, I still love you,
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.240]   "but we're just not meant to be a couple anymore.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.480]   "If there's kids involved,
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:13.840]   "then I really want us to have
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.820]   "a supportive relationship for them.
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:19.700]   "If there aren't, then maybe this really is the end."
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:24.500]   But it's step-by-step so this person can adjust
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:28.060]   to the fact that you really are leaving,
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.140]   but not too long and not too many steps,
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.960]   'cause then their expectations are raised,
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.860]   "Oh, maybe you're not really leaving."
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:38.740]   So these are general principles.
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:41.600]   Depends a lot on the specifics.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.040]   - Yeah, that was very helpful
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.780]   in reference to the high-conflict person,
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.640]   especially not placing blame on them.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.780]   I mean, I suppose in your own mind,
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:51.060]   you can hold all the litany of reasons
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:52.900]   why they are a terrible choice,
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.400]   or I guess more typically, if we're realistic,
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:00.020]   it's not going to be all black and white, right?
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:03.060]   I mean, one would hope that at the first sight
[01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:05.620]   of really egregious behavior, people are like, "I'm done."
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:06.980]   But typically it's a mix, right?
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.900]   I mean, this is, professionally and personally,
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:11.580]   it's often a mix.
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:15.540]   And I've certainly observed this professionally
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:18.160]   where people wanted to collect the degree,
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.660]   or they were three years into a degree,
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:24.580]   and leaving, it's always an option,
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.580]   and yet sometimes it's not an option.
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.380]   They have plans and financial obligations,
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:32.120]   and sunk cost is a real thing.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:33.420]   People always talk about sunk cost,
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.020]   like, "Oh, that's just sunk cost."
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.780]   Sunk cost is a real thing.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:40.180]   So I think, okay, so with the high-conflict person,
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:41.900]   I think you beautifully illustrated
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:45.280]   how to not blame them, not blame yourself.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.940]   Internally, you can hold any reasonable understanding
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:52.100]   that you come to, but you don't have to share all that.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:54.780]   And that you don't want to oscillate in indecision,
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:59.780]   but that perhaps things, some staging of the exit,
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:04.300]   not staging theatrically, rather staging meaning in stages,
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:07.580]   increments would be a better word.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:12.580]   What about with the high-conflict victim-playing person?
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:15.460]   That seems like it's a little trickier.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:17.060]   Yeah, please. - Let me back up a minute,
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.660]   'cause I want to say there's some times
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:22.140]   where you just need to get out and do it all at once,
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:25.100]   and don't ease yourself out.
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.660]   - Serious physical or emotional risks.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:30.020]   - Yes, so you may need to get away before you hint
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:32.780]   that I no longer want to be married to you.
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:37.300]   And I've worked with people, consulted with them
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:41.540]   on established, moving out when the other person
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:45.140]   isn't there, they and the kids go to a safe place,
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.320]   they've got their lawyer, and then they tell this person
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.380]   that I'm getting divorced from you.
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:53.380]   Because people get killed when they separate
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:57.180]   with certain high-conflict domestic violence people.
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:01.260]   So, also in the workplace, sometimes they're going
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:03.300]   to destroy, they're gonna send emails,
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.900]   they're gonna be really destructive, they may,
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:08.140]   you might say I'm gonna leave in a month,
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:11.860]   and they're so angry that they're gonna really
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.260]   destroy your business.
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:14.940]   - Well, this is why in the professional setting,
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:18.180]   they're, forgive the word, 'cause it's associated
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:21.580]   with this podcast often, but there are protocols
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.780]   for this in the workplace where if you have
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:28.700]   to let somebody go, there's a sequence of steps.
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:31.180]   And sometimes it involves telling people,
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.900]   you'll go home, we'll ship you your things,
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:35.540]   that's one extreme, go home now and there's somebody
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:37.580]   waiting to escort you out type of thing.
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:41.980]   Other times it's, listen, you're gonna finish out the month,
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:44.300]   but you're gonna finish that month out at home.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.460]   Other times it's, hey, you're welcome to stay
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:50.460]   and continue to participate, but by X date,
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:51.580]   that's your final day.
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:53.540]   So there's any number of different variations
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:55.900]   on these themes in the professional setting.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.820]   It sounds like there's any number of different variations
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:58.660]   in the personal setting too.
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:00.340]   - Right, it's nuanced.
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:02.860]   And that's where getting consultation,
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:06.900]   having a therapist, a lawyer, a high conflict consultant,
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:09.420]   someone that you kind of walk it through with,
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:12.300]   maybe even practice what you're going to say with.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:15.100]   - A third party observer seems really key, right?
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.020]   - Often.
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:18.260]   - Just for peace of mind.
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:19.100]   - Yes.
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:25.740]   Yeah, so mostly gradual, but sometimes fast, really depends.
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:31.180]   Now you asked about the person who plays the victim.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:34.540]   And I would suggest that that's very common
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:36.380]   with high conflict people,
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.780]   that when aggressive behavior doesn't work,
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:42.140]   they switch to, oh, how can you do this to me?
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:44.020]   I'm so sad.
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:46.060]   And what's interesting, the word that,
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:47.180]   I didn't come up with this,
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:50.660]   other people came up with in divorce settings,
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:53.620]   where let's say you're divorcing someone
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.860]   with high conflict personality,
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:00.460]   and they're like, I hate you,
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:04.140]   I hate you, don't leave me kind of personality.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.060]   And so, I'm divorcing you,
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:09.940]   and they're like in a rage at you,
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.300]   and then no, I'm really leaving.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.620]   Then they switch and beg and plead.
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:18.020]   And I've got cases where people say,
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:22.140]   and my ex-to-be just seduced me,
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:23.780]   and somehow I went along with it,
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:25.140]   'cause it felt real good.
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:29.860]   And it's back and forth from the high conflict person,
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:32.020]   and they call it hoovering.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.740]   You go, hoovering, where did that word come from?
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:36.420]   The hoover vacuum.
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.260]   - Oh, I see how it sounds like hoover vacuum.
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:38.580]   - What happens is they vacuum,
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:41.420]   they suck you back into the relationship.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:43.180]   And it's very common
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.380]   with some of the high conflict personalities.
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:46.940]   They can't stand to lose you,
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.780]   and when rage doesn't work,
[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:51.660]   then they try to seduce you back in.
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:55.180]   And some people have allowed themselves to get back in.
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:56.860]   And that's not good.
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:58.620]   You've gotta be ready for that,
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:50:59.980]   don't be surprised by that,
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:02.940]   and don't give in to that if you're sure it's over.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.020]   If you're not sure it's over,
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:07.420]   get couples counseling and see where it might go.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:10.580]   - I know a number of people who,
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:13.540]   let's just say, conceived children
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:20.260]   very in close proximity to the ending of the relationship,
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:22.380]   and therefore there was no end to the relationship
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:24.300]   until several years later.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.540]   I don't know of a single case
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.300]   where that led to a persistence of the relationship,
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:30.700]   for better or worse.
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.580]   So this sounds like it falls
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:34.900]   under the rubric of hoovering, right?
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.300]   People are leaving, and then they end up,
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:38.940]   you know, one more time,
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:43.100]   or just to try and make the pain go away type thing.
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:47.380]   And then they're bringing more of an attachment.
[01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:50.980]   I mean, obviously, a child is a forever tie, as they say.
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:55.380]   So, yeah.
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:58.180]   - I wouldn't say it's the majority of cases for sure,
[01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:02.620]   but it's a common symptom with high conflict people.
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:05.860]   And you hit on it, it's like they can't handle the pain.
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:09.540]   And so they really bring the person back in.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.420]   But if this is the direction you're going,
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:15.300]   you need to let them start coping with the pain,
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:19.240]   either step by step, or if it's dangerous, all at once.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:21.500]   But don't go back if you can help it.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:25.520]   - These are very helpful.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:27.460]   They're not even tips.
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:30.460]   This is very useful information for everyone listening.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:32.340]   I'm sure they agree.
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:34.980]   We had a guest on this podcast, Jonathan Haidt,
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:36.620]   who's written the book "Anxious Generation,"
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.100]   "The Coddling of the American Mind."
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:43.700]   And he mentioned some statistics that younger folks,
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.500]   so high school and younger, have seemed to lost
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:53.800]   or are losing the capacity to arbitrate among themselves.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:57.440]   That now, more typically, if there's a conflict,
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:00.460]   and here we're assuming not extreme conflict
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:02.980]   or anything criminal, but where there's a conflict
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:05.340]   between two kids at school,
[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:07.600]   and they bring it to the authorities.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.100]   When I was growing up, that was called tattling.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:11.660]   You were called a rat,
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:15.380]   and it got you semi-ostracized if you did it.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:16.820]   You learn quickly, don't do it.
[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:20.160]   Either you learn directly or you learn by observation.
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.700]   You don't be a tattletale.
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:23.900]   He claims that nowadays,
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.860]   there's more of this lack of ability to arbitrate
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:31.860]   and kids calling out other kids publicly or publicly.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:35.820]   And that parents are doing it now too.
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:40.180]   And this seems worrisome in that it seems like
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:44.020]   it would foster this group segregation
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:47.420]   and cultivating through emotional contagion,
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:51.060]   blaming of others and negative advocates.
[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:53.980]   I mean, I don't wanna blame social media for everything
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:55.820]   'cause I love social media for certain things.
[01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:57.880]   I exist on social media for a number of things
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:59.500]   that I believe are truly benevolent.
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.500]   So I'd be hypocritical if I said I didn't like social media,
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.760]   I love social media for certain things.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:06.220]   But are you concerned about this?
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.100]   I mean, this seems like a real issue.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.700]   I mean, the profession of law exists
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.940]   because of a lack of ability
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.420]   for people to arbitrate among themselves,
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:15.280]   but that's not what we're talking about here.
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.540]   We're not talking about people bringing therapists
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:19.980]   or lawyers to really help mediators.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:21.620]   We're talking about just people
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:23.700]   going to the authorities or online
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:28.260]   and trying to create some drama for what, to what end?
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:31.420]   - Yeah, I think in some ways, to some extent,
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:33.580]   that's high conflict parents
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:36.380]   who see everything in all or nothing terms,
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:41.380]   see their kids as offended by other kids
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:44.280]   or they're protecting their children.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:46.900]   And I am concerned about it.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:49.860]   And I also agree it isn't just social media.
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:53.340]   In many ways, I've been watching this
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:56.220]   since families got smaller.
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:55:01.100]   So I remember growing up, most families had several kids.
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:05.480]   The divorces I do now often have one or two kids.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:10.420]   And that's been true in many ways since the 1970s.
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:12.980]   And a lot of it has to do with birth control.
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:16.740]   So don't just blame social media, also blame birth control,
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.900]   that when people could decide how large a family they have,
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:22.500]   they decided to have smaller families.
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:25.980]   So birth control pills came out in the '60s.
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:28.420]   And the '70s, suddenly we started noticing
[01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:30.500]   people are having two kids.
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:35.500]   And by the '80s, '90s, 2000s, a lot of people have one kid.
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:39.840]   My most high conflict divorce cases have one kid
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:42.840]   because it's hard to share one kid.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.420]   It's a little bit easier to share two kids.
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:48.140]   It's a lot easier to share four kids.
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:50.660]   It's like, you can have them for the weekend.
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:52.660]   I'm not gonna fight with you about that.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:54.160]   Please, take them.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:58.220]   And the small family, and this is, I think,
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:01.980]   structurally a lot, the small family structure
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:06.200]   is feeding parents becoming enmeshed with their kids,
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.660]   some parents.
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:10.220]   And so their kids become their partners,
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:13.020]   especially in these high conflict divorces.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:16.300]   Now dad's a bad guy, mom's a bad woman,
[01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:19.560]   and the child, especially often the oldest child,
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.940]   now is my best friend,
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:25.140]   my kind of junior partner in the world.
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.700]   And that's where you see a lot of,
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:28.420]   you start getting alienated kids.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.700]   Now they hate dad and mom's perfect,
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.420]   or they hate mom and dad's perfect.
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.420]   - Parental estrangement is growing like crazy
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:39.380]   as a phenomenon.
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:40.580]   We're heading towards the holidays
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:43.500]   in a few weeks and months, and this is gonna come up.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:46.240]   I actually did an Instagram Live
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:51.020]   with a really skilled therapist named Mathias Barker,
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:54.260]   who specializes in, among other things,
[01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:55.980]   parental estrangement.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:58.940]   It's so common now, kids just deciding,
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.140]   I'm done with my parents.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:04.200]   - Right, and it's partly the culture is fulfilling that,
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.880]   that we're now seeing everything in opposing terms,
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:10.420]   all or nothing terms, et cetera.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.780]   And the big message I wanna get across with this,
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:17.600]   with all parents and kids, is it's a question of skills,
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.140]   that the kids aren't growing up with the skills
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.620]   to manage the nuances.
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:26.340]   And so we teach a lot of our skills,
[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:30.460]   and we teach parents, teach these to your kids in divorce.
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:33.460]   Flexible thinking, teach them flexible thinking.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:35.380]   Teach them manage emotions.
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:40.380]   Teach them to moderate their behavior.
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:42.540]   Teach them to check themselves.
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:44.860]   Wait a minute, am I doing something here,
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:47.340]   rather than always you, you, you.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:51.060]   And we developed a method, we call it New Ways for Families,
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:54.620]   which was designed for high-conflict divorce cases,
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:58.720]   for both parents to kind of learn these skills,
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:02.600]   and practice, either with a therapist, or a coach,
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.860]   or just watching online and typing in answers,
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:08.220]   to practice these four.
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:11.400]   We call these the four big skills for life.
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:14.620]   And this is, I think, what parents need to teach their kids,
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:17.020]   is you can solve that problem.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:18.940]   Tell me what happened, okay.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:22.180]   Let's talk about what you could say to Johnny.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:26.180]   And we teach skills we call ear statements.
[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:28.140]   Empathy, attention, and respect.
[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:30.040]   A statement that shows that.
[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:32.940]   And so we teach parents, teach your child,
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:36.340]   you know, your best friend who just broke up with you,
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.660]   might be feeling hurt about something.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:40.300]   Maybe something they said.
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:41.700]   What can you do?
[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:44.860]   So we encourage kids to help their kids
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:46.940]   manage the situation.
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:49.460]   And we encourage them to manage their relationship
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:50.780]   with the other parent.
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:55.340]   They come back from a visitation, or access,
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:58.340]   from a weekend, let's say with dad,
[01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:02.500]   and child says, you know, dad didn't look at my drawing.
[01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:05.640]   I drew a picture, and dad didn't look at my drawing.
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:08.820]   High-conflict parents says, oh, your dad's a jerk.
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:11.940]   You know, I always hated that about him.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:14.700]   A reasonable parent says, oh, that's sad.
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:18.860]   Well, you know what, next time, if he
[01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:22.420]   doesn't look at the picture right away, maybe wait an hour,
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:24.220]   and then show him the picture again.
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:26.940]   Maybe he got busy, maybe this or that.
[01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:31.540]   Teach your child to manage the relationship,
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:33.460]   even with the other parent.
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:37.020]   And those parents don't have high-conflict divorces.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:39.060]   High-conflict divorces have the other.
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:41.820]   Your dad's a jerk, you know, forget about him.
[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:43.980]   He'll never pay attention to you.
[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:49.660]   And that's when you see parents estranged or alienated,
[01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:52.100]   the kids alienated from the parents.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:54.660]   So you think that with increasing number of siblings,
[01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:57.180]   kids learn how to work things out among themselves.
[01:59:57.180 --> 01:59:58.780]   That's another big part of it, is you
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:01.220]   have to find out how to share.
[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:03.060]   So I had three siblings.
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:04.860]   And we grew up, and it's fascinating--
[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:07.300]   You're one of three, or you had three others?
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.140]   I'm one of four, so I have three others.
[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:10.380]   That's a good-sized kit.
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:13.020]   A brother, two sisters, so four.
[02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:15.760]   And what's fascinating for me, and I
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:18.580]   think it helped shape my personality and approach
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:20.860]   to life, is we grew up without television.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.580]   We didn't have something to watch after school.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:25.500]   We had to deal with each other.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:28.460]   So we might play kickball in the backyard,
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:31.820]   or we might read, or something or other.
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:35.900]   But we had to learn conflict resolution with each other.
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:38.980]   And our parents were like, you go talk to your brother, Bill.
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:42.300]   I don't have time to hear your complaint.
[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:46.100]   And so structurally, it's shocking,
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:48.460]   going from that to doing people's divorces
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:50.140]   with one or two children.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:52.420]   And even two is better than just one,
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:54.900]   because they do learn to share.
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:58.220]   But parents feel so guilty today,
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:04.500]   and that's our culture is really not fair to parents, I think,
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:07.460]   to know that teach your child ways
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.700]   to deal with it themselves.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:11.300]   I'll say, I have one sibling.
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:12.980]   We get along terrifically well.
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:14.420]   We're exceedingly close.
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:16.220]   But I can recall when we were kids,
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.180]   if we were getting into the scrap,
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:22.300]   my mom or dad would say, just sort it out among yourselves.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:24.660]   Just don't get any blood on the carpet.
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:25.940]   It was like that.
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:26.660]   It was like that.
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:28.360]   But then again, my mom's from New Jersey,
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:31.020]   and so it's like a different style, right?
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:34.020]   Anyone from New Jersey will understand that was a joke.
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:36.460]   But the point being that we learned pretty quickly
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:37.420]   how to sort things out.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.740]   My sister and I have had a few conflicts over the years,
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:41.200]   but we get along terrifically well.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.980]   We go on vacation together for our birthdays every year.
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:49.300]   But both of us had a lot of friends in the neighborhood.
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:51.860]   I grew up in a neighborhood with a lot of boys my age.
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:55.060]   She grew up in a neighborhood with a lot of girls her age.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:59.100]   And so I quickly learned in that big pack of boys,
[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:01.180]   and then I entered sports and got involved in things
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:03.700]   where it was like big packs of boys.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:06.100]   That's just kind of how it worked out, eventually
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:11.180]   young men and then men, that you couldn't say
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.720]   certain things or it was going to mean trouble.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.760]   - Yeah, you'd get punched in the face if you say that.
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.580]   - Right, but nowadays that would be considered like,
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:20.120]   oh, goodness, and you know, like, wait,
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:21.780]   obviously not a proponent for violence,
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:24.160]   but there were certain, I probably learned at 14
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:26.160]   that there were certain things you didn't say to friends
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.080]   or you'd get into the scrap with them,
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:29.720]   and then you'd remain friends.
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:31.600]   And so we arbitrated among each other,
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.560]   but also just how to share how to, you know,
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:38.720]   we would, I don't recommend this because I'll,
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:41.040]   well, whatever, we used to do these like dirt clod wars
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.900]   where you'd throw dirt at each other's heads,
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:47.500]   like, you know, and occasionally someone would throw a rock
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:50.740]   and cut some kid, and then, but that kid who threw the rock
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:53.100]   would get in trouble with us.
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:55.140]   It's not like we'd turn them into his parents.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.940]   You just kind of knew like he plays dirty
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.500]   and then he wouldn't play dirty again.
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:00.020]   Or if he did, then he kind of knew it.
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:02.260]   Like you got, there was just sort of an understanding
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:05.340]   of how people sorted out in groups.
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:08.120]   And this stuff hearkens back to primitive circuitry
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:10.380]   that's present in all old world primates, right?
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:11.940]   Chimpanzees in particular.
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:14.520]   I always tell people, if you want a really good watch
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.420]   and you want to learn about human behavior,
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:19.640]   watch Chimp Empire, the Netflix series,
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:23.580]   because it's basically the, it's the core circuitry
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:26.440]   of the primate brain in action, how people team up,
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.660]   how they cooperate, how they then,
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:31.180]   all the human behaviors pretty much are there
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:33.020]   except the technology development.
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:35.720]   Those chimps aren't building rockets and electric cars,
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:38.960]   but they're engaging in all the sorts of behaviors,
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.700]   both hierarchical and non-hierarchical,
[02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:43.100]   romantic and professional, so to speak.
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:44.500]   Chimps have professions too.
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:50.260]   To bring about cooperative and non-cooperative behavior
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:52.620]   and sort it out, it's fascinating.
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:54.980]   - Then the chimps are our closest relative, I think.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:55.920]   - Yeah, as far as I know.
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.480]   I mean, I have friends who are like really into the genomics
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:00.700]   of all this stuff, so I want to be careful.
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:01.900]   But I believe so.
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:03.540]   They are old world primates.
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:05.380]   We are old world primates.
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:08.220]   So there's a common lineage there for sure.
[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:09.440]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:12.320]   But I want to really reinforce what you're saying
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.500]   is about the community of learning
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:17.940]   and kids growing up in the community of learning.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:22.320]   And I think it plays a role with bullies.
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:25.280]   Because what happens is the community of kids
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:27.400]   figures out who's bullies
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.360]   and confronts them with their behavior.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:33.400]   And people ask me, well, are adult bullies,
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.680]   'cause my book is about adult bullies,
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:37.280]   were they bullies as kids?
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.840]   And I'll say it seems to be pretty universally
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:41.520]   they were as kids.
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:45.120]   But most kids try bullying at least once
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:47.960]   and they grow out of it because they get feedback.
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:50.080]   They learn that's not gonna work,
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:54.160]   you're not gonna have friends, I'm not gonna be around.
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:58.520]   So bullies learn to either change their behavior
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:00.760]   or to live on the fringe of the group
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:03.360]   if they don't change their behavior.
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.760]   And so part of why we're seeing more adult bullies today,
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:11.520]   I think, is because they used to be on the fringe
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.160]   because, or they learned how to get along.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:18.480]   But if they're on the fringe because nobody liked them
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:20.600]   and they didn't change their behavior.
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:25.480]   What we're seeing today is bullies are finding each other.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:29.320]   And this is one of the negatives of social media, I think.
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:31.280]   And I agree, there's a lot of good things.
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:33.320]   But this is one of the surprising things
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.280]   when I researched my book.
[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:38.560]   Bullies are finding a group for themselves.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:42.760]   And instead of the group teaching them not to be a bully,
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:45.320]   the group reinforces being a bully,
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:48.360]   says you were justified in doing that.
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.520]   And one of the shocking things
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.120]   is to find that school shooters
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:55.600]   have a support system online.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:56.440]   - Really?
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:59.120]   - That they seem to, some of the research says
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:01.220]   they always have a social media group.
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:04.960]   They have peers that they're trying to somewhat impress
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:08.100]   and that may actually edge them on.
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:11.960]   And that if they track down, they find these folks have,
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:13.520]   and I think they should look for that,
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:16.240]   find out who they've been talking to,
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:18.880]   who they communicate with.
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:21.840]   And so what I think we're seeing is bullies
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.560]   are reinforcing their bad behavior
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:29.200]   rather than social pressure for them to learn good behavior,
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:33.180]   which is for me, I've done a lot of group therapy.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:36.500]   I've treated people that go to Alcoholics Anonymous,
[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:40.120]   Narcotics Anonymous, and the group reinforces
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:42.860]   and teaches them good behavior.
[02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:46.060]   But bullies are finding other bullies
[02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:47.880]   and reinforcing their bad behavior.
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:49.680]   And that's an issue we have to address,
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.060]   especially with young men,
[02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:54.580]   is we have to get on top of that
[02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:59.580]   and redirect them into socially pro-social activities.
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:02.020]   And most people don't realize that.
[02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:03.500]   I didn't realize that.
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:07.260]   - Now that comes as a real surprise to me as well.
[02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:10.900]   Are there female bullies and male bullies online?
[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:13.060]   Or is it more typical that there are groups
[02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:14.540]   of male bullies online?
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:18.400]   - I haven't heard about female bullies finding each other.
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:22.460]   Well, actually I should take that back.
[02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:25.460]   And this gets into a sensitive area
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:28.100]   about personality disorders.
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:31.500]   But borderline personality disorder
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:35.700]   is one of the more treatable personality disorders.
[02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:39.140]   And people become aware that they have this disorder
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:42.080]   a lot from internet information.
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:43.920]   But what seems to happen,
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:45.700]   there's a couple stages for them.
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:49.820]   They become aware before they change their behavior.
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:54.260]   And like DBT, dialectical behavior therapy,
[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:56.620]   is a really good treatment for that.
[02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:01.620]   But therapists, and my wife is a DBT therapist,
[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:03.900]   said that they become aware of it
[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:05.540]   before they change their behavior.
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:09.200]   So they do self-sabotaging things,
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:10.500]   even though they shouldn't.
[02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:12.340]   I know I shouldn't do this, but.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.540]   And then finally they learn to change their behavior.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:17.900]   Well, some people are discovering their borderline
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:20.420]   and finding other people online
[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:24.020]   and reinforcing their borderline view of the world.
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:26.900]   There's evil people and good people.
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:30.660]   And occasionally they write reviews of my books
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:32.900]   and say how awful a person I am
[02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:35.380]   because I talk about personality disorders,
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:38.380]   even though I say don't identify anybody.
[02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:41.580]   And I believe personality disorders in most cases
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:44.520]   could be helped if they're open to that.
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:48.620]   So I think there's some degree of, say, female people
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:51.420]   with that personality finding each other
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:54.100]   and reinforcing that behavior.
[02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:58.940]   But what I read was, and I cite it in my book in the,
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:02.780]   I'm trying to remember, I don't remember which chapter,
[02:09:02.780 --> 02:09:07.140]   but that some researcher at a university said,
[02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:10.220]   look for their social media connections.
[02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:13.260]   And you'll find that there was a reinforcement
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:15.940]   of this behavior rather than people saying,
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:18.420]   hey, you can't do that, you've got to cut it out.
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.820]   - One of the best pieces of advice
[02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:24.100]   a colleague ever gave me was when I started teaching
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:25.800]   in the university to undergraduates,
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:28.660]   this was prior to my arriving at Stanford where I am now,
[02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:32.020]   I had this big class.
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:34.260]   And this colleague who's a neuroscientist,
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:35.380]   very esteemed neuroscientist,
[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:38.380]   but also trained as a psychiatrist, he's an MD,
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:40.480]   he said, just remember the statistics
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:44.740]   on various psychiatric and personality disorders.
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:47.260]   You've got 1% of the population is schizophrenic,
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:49.360]   you've got 10% at any time
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:51.220]   that's probably experiencing major depression,
[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:52.540]   you've got borderline, you've got that.
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:55.660]   And he said, so when you look out on your classroom,
[02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:59.280]   just understand that it's a not necessarily
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.180]   representative population, but that those challenges,
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:05.340]   he posed in the right way, he was patient-oriented,
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:09.180]   those challenges are present in that population.
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:11.920]   I mention this now because it's something to keep in mind
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:14.900]   anytime one goes onto social media and reads comments,
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.580]   you have to run those comments through the filter
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:21.320]   of what we know about the frequency
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:23.980]   of those challenges for people.
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:27.080]   Which is not to say that every negative comment
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:30.020]   is coming from somebody that's borderline or sociopathic,
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:34.240]   but there's a high probability that if somebody
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.360]   is continuously doing that,
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:40.340]   especially in the blame game type scenario,
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:43.300]   that that's what's going on there.
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:45.320]   - There's something I wanna fit in here,
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.800]   and that is that we need to understand
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.600]   that people with personality disorders
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.560]   didn't choose to have them.
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:57.920]   And so I have a lot of compassion for people like that.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:02.920]   And so I have a lot of students over the years,
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:05.800]   and they write reflective journals.
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:07.720]   And occasionally they put in their journal,
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:11.360]   "I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder."
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:13.200]   And I remember this one woman said,
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:16.600]   "So when you talked about borderline personality disorder,
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:19.080]   "it was a little uncomfortable for me,
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:21.680]   "but I found it helpful."
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:24.980]   And she was actually one of the better students in the class.
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:27.820]   And so she had that level of awareness,
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:31.480]   but she was still working on herself
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:36.480]   to manage the emotional rollercoaster and such.
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:39.840]   And so what's important to me is some people
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:41.760]   with borderline personality disorder
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:44.160]   may be angry with me 'cause I talk about it,
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:47.040]   'cause they're early stage with this.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:50.900]   But other people say, "Thank you, Bill, that was helpful."
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:53.640]   And so there's kind of a range there.
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.440]   But I also wanna say three basic reasons
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:00.380]   I think people develop personality disorders.
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:03.080]   The first is genetic tendencies.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:07.120]   And various researchers say like 20 to 80%
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:11.340]   may be the genetic tendency, depending on the person.
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:14.640]   That early childhood, first five years of life,
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:19.400]   maybe attachment difficulties may be a driving factor,
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.560]   but also cultural environment.
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:27.480]   Some people say, the researcher in San Diego
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.040]   wrote "The Narcissism Epidemic,"
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:32.480]   and she says from her research
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.040]   that the decade you're born in
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:40.040]   influences your personality development
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:41.720]   as much as your family.
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:42.560]   - Fascinating.
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:45.920]   - I don't agree with that 'cause she's not a therapist
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.040]   and looked at the mental health.
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.000]   She looked at big surveys, college students especially.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000]   But I think that's more significant than we realize
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.780]   and more significant than I used to think.
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:12:59.320]   And so part of what you're saying
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.000]   is today's culture is reinforcing
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.480]   not taking responsibility.
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:08.280]   Whereas in the past, you had to solve problems yourself.
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:12.360]   - On the positive side, I'll just get to it.
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.280]   It seems that even though family structures
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:18.880]   have changed quite a lot,
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:21.320]   even though culture is changing quite a lot,
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:23.880]   there's this wonderful feature
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:26.720]   of social media and the internet now,
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:30.040]   which is what we're doing right now,
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:32.320]   which is the opportunity for experts like yourself
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:34.160]   to come on and educate.
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:37.400]   And I think that as we started off talking about,
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.200]   it's probably about 90% of people
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.040]   do not fall into this high-conflict personality category.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:47.340]   And what we're talking about, what you're educating us on,
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:49.660]   is how to interact with this 10% in a way
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:53.300]   that brings about more functionality for everybody,
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:56.260]   more effective, professional, personal,
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:13:58.820]   familial interactions for everyone.
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:03.080]   It's not about just ostracizing those with challenges.
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.160]   So keeping with that,
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:11.900]   what should most people do
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:16.900]   if they are feeling frustrated with someone that they feel,
[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:20.960]   for instance, 80% of your problems come from 20% of people.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.300]   In this case, I guess we're saying
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:25.380]   like 90% of problems come from these 10% of people,
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:29.240]   but really it behooves us all to try and figure out
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:31.840]   how best to interact with others.
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:33.540]   And so you've spelled out a number of ways
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:35.160]   that we can do that today.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.740]   If you were to kind of highlight, I never want to pressure,
[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:43.640]   but highlight one or two things to just keep in mind
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:45.180]   as one moves through the world,
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:49.280]   the web tool seems especially effective.
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:51.940]   Is there anything else that you recommend
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:54.380]   that we just hold in mind as we navigate forward?
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:57.300]   'Cause it's quite a landscape out there.
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:14:58.540]   - Yeah.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:01.700]   Several things, and I can be brief with each of them.
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:04.940]   First, there's what I call the four forget about it's.
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:07.940]   Is forget about trying to give the person insight
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:10.400]   into how they're behaving.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:12.340]   That blows up the person.
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:14.300]   Just like I said, don't blame them
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:17.140]   for you ending the relationship.
[02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:20.220]   So just forget about giving them insight.
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:23.140]   Instead, talk about what we can do now.
[02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:25.300]   Talk about options.
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:28.140]   Talk about, don't go inward with them,
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:29.780]   go outward with them.
[02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:33.200]   So when you go inward, you escalate their defensiveness.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.780]   So don't try to give them insight into themselves.
[02:15:35.780 --> 02:15:38.940]   And a lot of people say, how can I make him see
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:40.740]   that what he's doing is so wrong?
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:42.540]   Or how can I make her understand
[02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:46.740]   that she's creating the problem we're trying to solve?
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:47.940]   Just forget about that.
[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:50.260]   Talk about, okay, here's what our options are.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:52.820]   Let's talk about what to do.
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:56.540]   Second is, don't emphasize the past.
[02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:59.220]   And people argue forever with high conflict people
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:01.740]   about the past, and you never resolve the past
[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:03.840]   with a high conflict person.
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:07.260]   And I'll tell you in a minute why that may be.
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:10.060]   Focus on what to do now and the future.
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:12.840]   Future focus, not past focus.
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:16.100]   Maybe you need some information to understand a problem,
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:18.960]   but then emphasize the future.
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:22.700]   The third is, don't focus on emotions.
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:26.820]   And especially don't yell at them, don't burst into tears,
[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:30.840]   don't tell them how frustrating they are, all of that.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:33.660]   And this is what I'm gonna tell you now is a theory
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:35.860]   that I hope someone figures out.
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:39.380]   And that is, people with personality disorders
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:42.940]   and high conflict personalities don't seem to go through
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:46.400]   the five stages of the grieving and healing process.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:51.180]   Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,
[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:53.380]   sadness, and acceptance.
[02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:57.500]   They seem to get stuck at denial and anger.
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:00.660]   So what happens is, they don't resolve things.
[02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:03.080]   They don't, quotes, get over things.
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:04.620]   They don't get over the divorce.
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.460]   They don't get over the job loss.
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:09.180]   They don't get over having to sell their house
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:11.460]   'cause they couldn't pay the mortgage.
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:14.860]   They don't experience the normal human
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:17.540]   healing and grieving process.
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:19.060]   So they're stuck.
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:23.060]   And so a lot of situations with them turn to anger.
[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:26.660]   They're angry, but they're not resolved.
[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:29.740]   So high conflict people are constantly talking
[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:33.260]   about the past and how aggrieved they are.
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:35.100]   They shouldn't have done that to me.
[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:37.660]   I was right to have done this.
[02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:39.860]   And people start, when I say that,
[02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:42.380]   like students in my class, oh yeah,
[02:17:42.380 --> 02:17:45.940]   that's what I see, they keep repeating themselves.
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:48.140]   And they go to as many people as they can
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:49.620]   and tell the story.
[02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:52.740]   I believe they're trying to grieve and heal,
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:54.880]   but they don't have the mechanism.
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:56.660]   And I don't know exactly why.
[02:17:56.660 --> 02:17:59.940]   So I'm hoping someday neuroscience will figure out
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:04.220]   what connection is missing and can we give people that
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:05.940]   so that they can grieve and heal.
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:09.320]   Well, what that means is, if you focus on emotions,
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:12.580]   you're focusing on an area that's unresolved
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:14.900]   and has a lot of hurt.
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:18.500]   And so if you say, well, how do you feel about that?
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:20.860]   They almost always say, I feel terrible.
[02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:23.880]   I suggest not saying, how you doing today?
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:27.180]   Because the answer I get is terrible.
[02:18:27.180 --> 02:18:28.780]   You know what she did yesterday.
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:31.140]   You know what he did last week.
[02:18:31.140 --> 02:18:34.940]   So instead, do small talk, do it about anything
[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:39.140]   except about how are you feeling today.
[02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:41.540]   So don't ask how you're feeling.
[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:45.060]   Focus on thinking and doing.
[02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:48.540]   And an example I teach lawyers and mediators
[02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:52.060]   is don't say, how do you feel about that proposal?
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:53.900]   Say, what do you think about that?
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:55.300]   Could you picture doing that?
[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:56.540]   How could you do that?
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:58.740]   How could that work for you?
[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:01.300]   Because if you focus, how do you feel?
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:03.160]   I feel insulted.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.140]   I feel abandoned.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:06.500]   And then they drown in that.
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.180]   And next thing you know, you've lost them.
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:12.300]   So avoid emotions.
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:15.820]   Don't focus on emotions, but acknowledge emotions.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:18.740]   Say, I can see your frustration.
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:21.820]   Now here's how I can help you today.
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:24.420]   The fourth is don't use names.
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:26.020]   Don't label people.
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:28.580]   Don't say you're a high-conflict person.
[02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:30.900]   And lawyers do that to motivate their clients.
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:33.140]   That doesn't work.
[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:35.580]   Don't say you have a personality disorder.
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:39.540]   You may be wrong, and that never motivates anybody.
[02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:40.380]   So that's the fourth.
[02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:41.300]   Forget about it.
[02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:45.140]   So that's key stuff for people to avoid.
[02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:47.540]   So that was a long answer, but when you're ready,
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:50.620]   I have four simple tips for things to do.
[02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:53.020]   That was a great answer.
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:55.460]   Would love to hear the four simple tips for people
[02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:56.940]   to pay attention to.
[02:19:56.940 --> 02:19:59.980]   OK, I'm so glad you asked that question.
[02:19:59.980 --> 02:20:03.260]   So we have what I call the CARS method.
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:06.860]   And we've actually trademarked this CARS method.
[02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:10.700]   Connecting, analyzing, responding, and setting
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:12.420]   limits.
[02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:14.380]   First is connect with the person.
[02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:16.540]   So someone's angry with you, or you're
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:19.820]   trying to help somebody with their problem.
[02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:22.700]   Is connect with them by giving them
[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:27.140]   a statement that shows empathy, attention, and/or respect.
[02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:31.340]   You know, I can see how hard this is.
[02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.020]   I see your disappointment.
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:35.180]   I hear your frustration.
[02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:37.260]   I can understand.
[02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:41.500]   By saying I can, I'm showing I see them as an equal,
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:43.500]   rather than looking down on them.
[02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:48.380]   So that's the empathy rather than sympathy.
[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:49.140]   Pay attention.
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:50.420]   Say, I'll pay attention.
[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:51.140]   Tell me more.
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:54.100]   I want to understand your situation.
[02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:56.420]   And listen some.
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:00.620]   And so what I see all the time is people say,
[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:04.420]   it's like, oh, good, because I'm going to listen to them.
[02:21:04.420 --> 02:21:06.620]   They don't have to prove-- they don't have to fight
[02:21:06.620 --> 02:21:08.300]   to get my attention.
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:10.220]   And high conflict people often are
[02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:12.460]   fighting to get attention, because they've
[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:14.500]   turned everybody off.
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:17.380]   And that's why I teach lawyers and therapists that.
[02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:19.580]   So they're going to come to you as much as anything
[02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:21.540]   else to get your attention.
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:23.780]   So let them tell their story.
[02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:24.740]   Listen to them.
[02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:27.180]   Acknowledge the emotion.
[02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:29.820]   So empathy, attention, and respect.
[02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:32.260]   Find something you respect about them.
[02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:34.860]   They respect the kind of work they do.
[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:39.060]   You respect their relationship with their son or daughter.
[02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:44.100]   Or you respect their commitment to resolving this dispute.
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:46.220]   So use those words.
[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:49.580]   And what's fascinating is I teach this to people
[02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:50.740]   who I consult with.
[02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:53.340]   And then they come back and say, I did that.
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:54.300]   And it really worked.
[02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:56.500]   The person calmed down.
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:01.820]   I had one woman who said my boss was giving me a hard time.
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:06.020]   And so I'd run into my office to try not to interact with her.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:08.700]   And I said, next time, especially like Monday morning
[02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:14.180]   or something, is go up to her and say, how was your weekend?
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:17.940]   Or say, I appreciated the presentation you gave last
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:18.440]   week.
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:21.740]   Give her some empathy, attention, and/or respect.
[02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:23.660]   You don't have to do all three of these.
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:28.740]   Just any one of these often calms the relationship.
[02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:31.580]   And I remember checking back with this woman a month later
[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:33.100]   and says, guess what, Bill?
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:35.340]   Now I'm her favorite employee.
[02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:37.020]   But she's picking on somebody else,
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:40.660]   so I gave somebody else your book.
[02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:44.660]   But the idea is connect with people.
[02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:47.820]   So empathy, attention, and respect.
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:50.340]   And ear statements, we call it.
[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:52.940]   And people say they really remember that,
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:55.100]   because you can use that with anybody, anywhere,
[02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:56.660]   even with your kids.
[02:22:56.660 --> 02:22:58.500]   Genuine respect, right?
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:22:59.620]   You're not puffing them up.
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:00.180]   This all has to be honest.
[02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:01.620]   Yeah, you're not puffing them up.
[02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:02.380]   Yes.
[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:04.020]   Think about that.
[02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:07.180]   Now, if you don't respect them and you
[02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:09.300]   don't have empathy for them, tell them
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:12.300]   you'll pay attention and listen.
[02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:14.940]   And often, you'll start developing some empathy
[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:17.140]   or respect for them.
[02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:20.780]   But you can always pay attention and listen.
[02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:22.740]   So that's connecting.
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:26.220]   The second area-- and these aren't exactly steps,
[02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:28.260]   but these are four areas high conflict
[02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:30.460]   people have difficulty.
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:33.940]   The second is emotions kind of cloud their thinking.
[02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:35.460]   So we want to help them think.
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:38.700]   So you want to move to analyzing.
[02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:41.220]   Give them a way to think.
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:43.340]   So you're kind of calming the emotions,
[02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:46.340]   and now you're saying, let's think about this.
[02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:50.340]   So present problems as a choice.
[02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:54.300]   You could do this now or do this tomorrow.
[02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:56.020]   Or here's the options I see.
[02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:59.100]   There's three ways you could approach this problem.
[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:01.700]   So you're getting people thinking about the problem
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:03.380]   rather than reacting.
[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:05.180]   And when you give a choice, it kind of
[02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:09.820]   forces them into logical problem solving.
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:13.580]   So one way you can do this is, especially
[02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:16.780]   if you have a professional relationship like employer,
[02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:20.220]   employee, therapist, client, stuff like that,
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:21.780]   is have them write a list.
[02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:23.740]   They're talking, they're saying, this is wrong,
[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:25.260]   and that's wrong, and that's wrong.
[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:26.980]   You say, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:32.260]   Write a list of these problems so I can get a clearer picture.
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:35.180]   When you write a list, you calm down.
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:37.320]   And I've had this over and over again.
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:41.220]   Angry people, when they're writing a list, calm down.
[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:42.340]   They start thinking about--
[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:45.780]   I've done this with a doctor once.
[02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:47.780]   He was having trouble with the nurses.
[02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:49.780]   And it was like they're doing everything wrong.
[02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:52.820]   Write a list of all the things they're doing wrong.
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:54.320]   And pretty soon, you start thinking,
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:56.060]   you know, there's this other thing they do,
[02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:59.180]   but it's not so bad, actually.
[02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:02.620]   And I want them to do this on the left-hand side of the page.
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:04.860]   Because on the right-hand side, we're
[02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:08.700]   going to start looking at what are possible solutions.
[02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:10.500]   And you really calm people down.
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:11.860]   I've done this as a media.
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:13.980]   I've had both people, OK, I want you
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:17.780]   to write two lists, like business partners.
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:20.580]   Now, say you're trying to decide whether to split up or keep
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:22.620]   the business partnership.
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:25.620]   So I want you both to write a list, what
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:28.940]   you would do if you split up, wind down the partnership,
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:31.020]   the steps you'd have to take.
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:34.780]   And another list, what the steps would be if you could
[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:37.540]   make it work between you.
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:40.460]   So let's meet in a week, and we'll look at your list.
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:43.020]   Come back a week later, they say, you know what?
[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:44.180]   We both wrote our lists.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:47.740]   We immediately called each other and realized
[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:50.740]   that we should terminate the partnership,
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:54.820]   but we have one last big project we want to do together.
[02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:58.740]   And we realize now we can go our separate ways in peace.
[02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:00.260]   We really have different goals.
[02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:02.940]   It's not her fault. It's not her fault.
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:05.940]   This was two women who worked together.
[02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:08.420]   And so writing a list helps.
[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:12.940]   This is all under analyzing, the A of the Kaur's method.
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:15.620]   Having the person make a proposal.
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:17.820]   Say, make me a proposal.
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:20.860]   I tell managers, as soon as you can,
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:26.180]   tell your employees that now that I'm your manager,
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:27.940]   whenever you bring me a problem--
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:31.100]   and I want you to bring me problems when they're small,
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:34.980]   because conflicts that are small are much easier to resolve.
[02:26:34.980 --> 02:26:37.340]   Always bring a solution to the problem.
[02:26:37.340 --> 02:26:39.380]   I want to hear your proposed solution,
[02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:42.820]   because you know the problem better than I do.
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:44.700]   You're getting them to think.
[02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:47.260]   So high conflict people, I believe,
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:49.660]   have a bandwidth for problem solving.
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:54.060]   And some are brilliant heads of companies, inventors,
[02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:55.380]   all that stuff.
[02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:57.860]   They got a big bandwidth for conflict,
[02:26:57.860 --> 02:27:00.340]   but they also have a bandwidth for problem solving.
[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:03.780]   You want to aim at that and bring that out.
[02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:05.780]   So that's analyzing.
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:08.540]   R is for responding.
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:11.940]   High conflict people, because they blame so much,
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:13.820]   are always saying, you should have done this.
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:16.260]   You didn't do that.
[02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:19.420]   Our tendency is to argue with high conflict people.
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:20.980]   And that's a forget about it.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:22.460]   You're trying to give them insight.
[02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:23.820]   It's not going to work.
[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:28.260]   So instead, give them what we call a BIF response.
[02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:32.220]   That's brief, informative, just straight information.
[02:27:32.220 --> 02:27:33.900]   Don't tell them you're wrong.
[02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:37.260]   Just tell them what the information is.
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:39.620]   And do it in a friendly manner.
[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:40.820]   And have it be firm.
[02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:43.780]   Have it end the discussion.
[02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:46.860]   Most commonly, BIF responses are in writing.
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:50.180]   And we teach this as an email method.
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:53.740]   And we estimate there's about a million people doing BIF now,
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:56.700]   because we taught it to about half a million people--
[02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:59.500]   professionals and individuals.
[02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:01.660]   We've got four little BIF books.
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:02.180]   We've got--
[02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:04.300]   So it's brief, informative, friendly.
[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:05.340]   And firm.
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:05.820]   Firm.
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:06.980]   And those four things.
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:09.540]   Friendly is immaterial.
[02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:11.780]   Well, a touch of friendliness.
[02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:15.060]   So what I say, like someone writes to you and say,
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:18.100]   you know, you're doing everything wrong.
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:19.940]   And you write back, and you say, thank you
[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:22.060]   for telling me your concerns.
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:23.700]   Here's some information you may not--
[02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:25.740]   like say someone tells me, Bill, your methods
[02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:27.540]   are never going to work.
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:29.940]   And I get instantly defensive.
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:33.780]   And so thank you for telling me your concerns.
[02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:36.820]   You may not be aware, but about a million people
[02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:39.060]   are using this method now.
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:42.380]   And I wish you well.
[02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:43.660]   Something like that.
[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:45.100]   So a touch of friendliness.
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:46.460]   Doesn't have to be a lot.
[02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:49.040]   And firm doesn't mean harsh.
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:53.900]   It just means try to end the hostile conversation.
[02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:58.460]   So don't respond to their distortions,
[02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:00.340]   maybe, even, when they say you've
[02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:04.820]   done this, or misinformation, or hostility.
[02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:07.660]   It's just give them a BIF response.
[02:29:07.660 --> 02:29:14.700]   And I tell that sometimes to business owners, sometimes
[02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:18.900]   public figures, is they might say, like politicians
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:22.140]   sometimes, terrible things are said about them, and they go,
[02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:23.620]   but they're not true.
[02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:25.100]   And they're going to go, well, I'm
[02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:28.460]   going to ignore that because no one will believe that.
[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:30.420]   But then people believe it.
[02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:36.340]   A great example, Domino's Pizza about 10 years ago.
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:37.380]   This is a great story.
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:41.340]   I love it, and I also eat Domino's Pizza.
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:43.480]   I won't get into the details, but somebody
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:46.980]   said something that grossed people out,
[02:29:46.980 --> 02:29:49.100]   and their stock just dropped.
[02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:51.380]   Two employees did something to the pizza.
[02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:56.620]   So first, they were going to ignore that.
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.840]   Everyone's going to realize that was a dumb thing
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:01.420]   two employees did.
[02:30:01.420 --> 02:30:04.500]   Well, their stock dropped like 10% or something like that.
[02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:07.420]   But two days later, the head of Domino's Pizza
[02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:13.300]   puts out a 90-second video, and it gets spread around.
[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:16.380]   And what he says is, two former employees
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:20.060]   did this gross thing, and that doesn't represent us.
[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:22.820]   And most important to us is our customers.
[02:30:22.820 --> 02:30:24.900]   We're totally dedicated to you.
[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:26.660]   This is never going to happen again.
[02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:29.540]   We've done everything to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:30.980]   So they bounced right back.
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:33.980]   And in my mind, 90-second video didn't
[02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:36.820]   do a 20-minute explanation of how we do this.
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:39.020]   That's just 90-second video.
[02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:43.780]   Head of the company put it out there, bounced right back.
[02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:45.780]   And to me, that was a BIF response,
[02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:47.820]   even though we never heard of it.
[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:51.340]   Brief, informative, friendly, and firm.
[02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:54.540]   So that's CARS, C-A-R--
[02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:55.320]   That's R.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:55.820]   Yep.
[02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:56.820]   That's the responding.
[02:30:56.820 --> 02:30:58.060]   What's S?
[02:30:58.060 --> 02:31:00.380]   The S is setting limits.
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:02.580]   And this may be the most important
[02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:05.780]   with high-conflict people, because one
[02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:08.220]   of their biggest problems is they don't stop themselves.
[02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:12.880]   They keep going in areas where most people stop themselves.
[02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:13.760]   They keep talking.
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:15.220]   They talk a lot.
[02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:18.860]   They create a problem and keep creating the problem.
[02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:20.660]   They don't stop.
[02:31:20.660 --> 02:31:25.380]   And so people around them have to stop them.
[02:31:25.380 --> 02:31:28.460]   And we're not used to stopping other people's behavior.
[02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:31.220]   Most people manage themselves.
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:34.980]   And part of writing my books is I believe today
[02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:37.660]   that we have more high-conflict behavior,
[02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:40.020]   and everyone needs to learn skills
[02:31:40.020 --> 02:31:44.660]   to set limits on bullies, on high-conflict people's
[02:31:44.660 --> 02:31:45.460]   behavior.
[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:46.700]   It's all about behavior.
[02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:50.620]   They're not bad people, but they don't have the self-restraint.
[02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:54.740]   So setting limits and key things here--
[02:31:54.740 --> 02:31:56.180]   don't blame them.
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:58.060]   Don't blame yourself.
[02:31:58.060 --> 02:32:02.060]   Say there's a policy, there's a rule, there's a law.
[02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:07.380]   How it looks to people is do this instead of doing that.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:11.320]   So that behavior-- and if you keep doing that behavior,
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:14.460]   here's what the consequence is.
[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:18.020]   So I have a method I call SLCC.
[02:32:18.020 --> 02:32:19.380]   So everything I've got initials.
[02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:20.460]   You've got a lot of acronyms.
[02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:20.980]   That's all right.
[02:32:20.980 --> 02:32:22.140]   Scientists have acronyms.
[02:32:22.140 --> 02:32:24.900]   Military science and apparently Bill Eddy.
[02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:27.500]   High-conflict methods.
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:32.860]   So SLCC is setting limits and imposing consequences.
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:36.300]   So with high-conflict people, you might set the limit.
[02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:39.540]   Like you say-- I'll give an example.
[02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:41.860]   As a lawyer, I represented a woman
[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:44.100]   victim of domestic violence.
[02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:47.340]   Her ex-husband-to-be didn't have a lawyer.
[02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:49.300]   So that means he's allowed to talk to me.
[02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:52.980]   I have to talk to him, negotiate, solve problems.
[02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:55.980]   So he calls me up, and he says, we've
[02:32:55.980 --> 02:32:57.220]   got to solve this problem.
[02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:00.900]   You tell that blankety-blank-blank wife of mine.
[02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:01.860]   I said, hold on.
[02:33:01.860 --> 02:33:04.500]   You can't talk about my client that way.
[02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:07.060]   He said, I'll talk about her any way I want to.
[02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:09.940]   She's a blankety-blank-blank or whatever.
[02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:12.640]   So he didn't respect my limit at all.
[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:15.820]   So then I said, if you keep talking like that,
[02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:17.540]   I'm going to hang up.
[02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:19.620]   And so it's up to you.
[02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:21.820]   He says, I'll talk about her any way I want.
[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:22.860]   Keeps talking like that.
[02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:25.420]   I said, OK, you've chosen for me to hang up.
[02:33:25.420 --> 02:33:26.820]   I'm hanging up now.
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:29.540]   Call me when you're ready to be civil.
[02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:32.580]   So end of call.
[02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:34.180]   Next morning, he calls me back.
[02:33:34.180 --> 02:33:38.620]   He says, Mr. Eddy, we have to solve this problem.
[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:41.700]   My blankety-blank-blank wife-- and I say, hang on.
[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:44.580]   Remember, I'm going to hang up if you talk like that.
[02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:46.220]   He says, oh, no, no, no, don't hang up.
[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:48.140]   We have to solve this problem.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:51.620]   I'll try not to say those words.
[02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:54.220]   And he doesn't say those words.
[02:33:54.220 --> 02:33:56.940]   We get to address the problem.
[02:33:56.940 --> 02:34:02.660]   So the consequence is what stopped him, not the limit.
[02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:05.460]   And I think it's a brain thing that they're
[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:07.820]   so absorbed in the emotions of the moment
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.960]   that they can't picture that their behavior has
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:11.300]   a consequence.
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:13.740]   So if the people around them point out
[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:16.380]   there's a consequence if you do that, it's kind of a jolt
[02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:19.580]   to them, oh, I don't want that consequence.
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:22.180]   And so with high conflict people,
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:25.140]   you often have to tell them the consequence when
[02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:30.140]   you set the limit, and be ready to impose the consequence.
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:33.040]   So that's setting limits, imposing consequences.
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:37.020]   They have to go together with high conflict people.
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:37.940]   Love it.
[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:40.100]   And I know that those listening and watching
[02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:41.420]   really appreciate this.
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:44.260]   I mean, these are incredibly valuable tools.
[02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:45.820]   I mean, I can say from my own life,
[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:49.460]   and I know observing the experiences of others
[02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:53.620]   and what people have shared with me that here,
[02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:56.020]   I have to be careful because I don't want to place blame.
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:35:00.140]   Let me phrase this correctly, that the ability
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:04.180]   to navigate interactions with high conflict personalities
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:08.420]   well can lead to a dramatic improvement in people's lives,
[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:10.900]   both for the non-high conflict personalities
[02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:12.820]   and the high conflict personalities.
[02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:15.380]   And that a failure to do that does exactly the opposite.
[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:20.380]   So look, I really want to thank you for doing the work
[02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:24.460]   that you do as a lawyer, as a therapist,
[02:35:24.460 --> 02:35:26.100]   the research that you've done.
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:29.540]   You're incredibly well researched and thorough.
[02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:31.180]   Send me papers in advance of this,
[02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:32.840]   in addition to having written all these books
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:35.180]   that we'll provide links to in the show note captions.
[02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:36.060]   I've read several of them,
[02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.620]   but I plan to read the others as well.
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:41.940]   You have a book specifically on relationships.
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:45.340]   You have books on bullies.
[02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:48.180]   You have a book about five types of people
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:51.460]   that can ruin your life and several others as well.
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:53.180]   So we'll put links to those as well
[02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:55.780]   as some other resources related to your work.
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:56.860]   And also just want to thank you
[02:35:56.860 --> 02:36:00.260]   for being a contributor to public education.
[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:02.500]   I mean, that's what this podcast is.
[02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:03.900]   People listen to this podcast
[02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:06.620]   in hopes of gleaning information that they can really apply
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:08.420]   and that they can pass on to others.
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:10.100]   And you're doing incredible work.
[02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:12.380]   You're also teaching in the university system
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:15.340]   later today, so you're quite, quite busy
[02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:17.200]   and we're deeply appreciative
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:18.940]   that you took the time to come educate us.
[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:22.300]   So on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching,
[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:24.620]   I just want to extend a deep gratitude.
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:25.460]   Thank you.
[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:26.300]   You're trying to make the world a better place
[02:36:26.300 --> 02:36:28.620]   and you are making the world a better place.
[02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:29.540]   - Thank you so much.
[02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:32.940]   I appreciate the chance to speak with you and get this out.
[02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:34.100]   - Great, we'll come back again
[02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:37.140]   and tell us more about bullies and the rest.
[02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:38.200]   There's a lot more to cover.
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:39.940]   We'd love to have you back.
[02:36:39.940 --> 02:36:41.880]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:43.020]   with Bill Eddy.
[02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:45.020]   I hope you found it to be as interesting
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:47.580]   and practically informative as I did.
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:49.080]   To learn more about Bill Eddy's work

[02:37:22.100 --> 02:37:23.820]   I do read all the comments.
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:24.940]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:26.140]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:27.780]   It's my very first book.
[02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:29.180]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:31.320]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:32.500]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:33.640]   for more than five years,
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:35.980]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:37.540]   of research and experience.
[02:37:37.540 --> 02:37:39.340]   And it covers protocols for everything
[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:43.080]   from sleep to exercise to stress control,
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:45.500]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:48.900]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:50.980]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:54.860]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:57.220]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:37:57.220 --> 02:37:59.020]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:00.780]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:03.360]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:05.340]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:08.300]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:10.900]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:12.780]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:14.340]   And on all those platforms,
[02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:16.460]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:17.940]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:19.420]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:21.300]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:22.500]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast.
[02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:25.560]   Again, that's "Huberman Lab" on all social media channels.
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:26.700]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:28.500]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:29.900]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:31.940]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:34.580]   that includes podcast summaries as well as protocols
[02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:37.420]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs.
[02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:39.700]   Those protocol PDFs are on things
[02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:41.580]   like neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:44.160]   optimizing dopamine, improving your sleep,
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:46.340]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
[02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:48.420]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:50.580]   that describes a template routine
[02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:52.100]   that includes cardiovascular training
[02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:54.060]   and resistance training with sets and reps,
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:55.380]   all backed by science,
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:57.900]   and all of which, again, is completely zero cost.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:00.500]   To subscribe, simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:03.100]   go to the menu tab up in the upper right corner,
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:05.220]   scroll down a newsletter, and provide your email.
[02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:07.660]   And I should emphasize that we do not share your email
[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:08.500]   with anybody.
[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:09.860]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:12.340]   for today's discussion with Bill Eddy.
[02:39:12.340 --> 02:39:14.460]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:16.360]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:18.940]   [upbeat music]
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:21.520]   (upbeat music)
