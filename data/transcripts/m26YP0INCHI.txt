[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Juliet, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   "Hello, Pastor John. I have a simple question for you.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   So what does it actually mean to be a worshiper?"
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The key text for me is Matthew 15, 7 and 8.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   "You hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   when he said, 'This people honors me with their lips,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   but their heart is far from me.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   In vain do they worship me.'"
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   So from that I see first that worship is about honoring God.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   A worshiper is one who honors God.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   "This people honors me with their lips.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   In vain do they worship me."
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   In other words, they're failing in what they're
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   attempting to do rightly.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   So it's right to want to honor God.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   That's what worship should be,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   to show God to be of highest honor in the universe,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   highest value, highest worth, highest worthy of praise,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   worthy of most admiration.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   That's what God is, and worship shows Him to be that,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   reflects that.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Worship is an echo of those excellencies of God,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and worship should be a way to think about it.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And then the second thing I notice in that text,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   besides honor God, is the prominence of the heart.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "This people honors me with their lips,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   but their heart is far from me.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   In vain do they worship me."
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Their worship is empty because they're doing it with lips
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   without heart.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   There is no authentic worship where the heart is not engaged.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It's empty worship. It's vain worship.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So the essence, I'm going to argue in answer here,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   that the essence of worship is not the movement of your lips,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   not the movement of your hands, not the movement of your knees,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   not the movement of your tongue.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   The essence of worship is the movement of your heart,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that is, your affections, your spiritual emotions.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And those other acts, those outward acts,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   are not in worship when they are expressing
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   what the heart is authentically feeling.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And what is that?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, it's not mere willpower,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   because these folks had enough of that
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   because they were doing this lip moving.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   "This people honors me with their lips."
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   They had the willpower to go to church
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and move their lips and sing the songs,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   and so that's not worship.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Worship is not the willpower to make yourself do stuff
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   that is religious.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   What's missing is spiritual affections.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Their heart is far from me.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   They are not the direct product of willpower.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   You can't make yourself feel gratitude if you don't feel it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You can't make yourself feel admiration from somebody you find boring.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You can't just turn it on and off like a switch.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's not willpower.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   These are real, genuine, authentic emotions
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   that are quickened and awakened by true perceptions of God.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And so here's some examples of what I mean.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   "The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   a broken and contrite heart.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   O God, you will not despise.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I confess my iniquity.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I am sorry for my sins."
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So the emotion of contrition and the emotion of sorrow for sin
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   is a beautiful act of worship because it reflects the value of God
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   from which we've fallen so short.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And then we mingle with those feelings of contrition,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   feelings of longing and desire,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   as a heart longs for the flowing stream,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   so my soul longs for thee.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And then we mingle with our contrition for sin
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and our longing for mercy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   We mingle fear and awe.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I will worship toward the holy temple in the fear of thee, Psalm 5:7.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And then we approach him with fear and trembling,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and he crowns us with his mercy,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and we enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Give thanks to him and bless his name,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and then mingled with all that gratitude and joy is the hope.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Be glad in the Lord and rejoice and shout for joy,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   all you upright in heart.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Why are you downcast, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Hope in God, for I shall again praise him.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So those texts combine contrition, sorrow, longing, desire, fear, awe,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   gratitude, joy, hope.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   These are the things that are the essence of worship.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   These are the heartfelt affections that respond to the beauty of God.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So here's my answer to her question, Juliet's question.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So a worshiper is one who experiences these affections for God and more.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Worship happens when we see God truly and feel him duly.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It's worship in spirit and truth.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Truth shows us true views of God, and the spirit awakens with the kind of
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   affections that correspond to that truth.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So that's what it means to be a worshiper.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Yes, amen. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   But, of course, that then raises a perplexing question of its own.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So if I feel no affection for God, can I truly be worshiping him?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   We'll tackle that on Monday.
