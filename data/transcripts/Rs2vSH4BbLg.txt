[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020]   One of the other things I would mention is our kids,
[00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.100]   I found it to be really helpful in trying to approach
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.420]   some of the challenges that they're experiencing
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.260]   from a place of curiosity.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.300]   One of the examples that I experienced
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.820]   was our four-year-old resisting going to school.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.540]   She really just fought it.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.180]   She did not want to go into the classroom.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.220]   She was not excited when she'd wake up.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.960]   So instead of trying to quickly fix the problem,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.740]   we approached her from a place of curiosity,
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.580]   just trying to understand more of the behavior.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.940]   So help us understand, like,
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.520]   why don't you want to go to school?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.780]   What's happening right now?
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.620]   Tell me more.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.340]   And I think what we realized is not
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.780]   that she didn't like school.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.060]   She was actually bored.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.860]   She didn't feel like she was being challenged.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.720]   And that really allowed us to figure out ways
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.780]   that we could help integrate some of that
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.020]   into her next school year to ensure
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.780]   that she was feeling challenged in the right way.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.140]   And now she loves school.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.340]   So I think to approaching it from a place of curiosity
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.460]   as opposed to any kind of judgment
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.940]   and having that open mind allows us and her
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.940]   to really collaborate and come up with a solution together.
