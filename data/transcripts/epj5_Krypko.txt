[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.080]   the Gospel according to St. John in the fourth chapter, reading again from verse ten to verse
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.080]   fourteen.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   "Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.520]   saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.160]   thee living water.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.840]   The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from whence
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.560]   then hast thou that living water, art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.840]   us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.820]   Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again;
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.240]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.080]   water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.080]   life."
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.200]   I am particularly anxious to deal with verses ten, thirteen, and fourteen.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.360]   We come back to consider this great story of the meeting between our blessed Lord and
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.720]   Saviour and the woman of Samaria, and we are considering it, as most of you will recall,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.280]   because we find in it a wonderful statement of the great central principles of the Christian
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   salvation.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.740]   Here, I always feel, is a story for which we should thank God, for the thing that strikes
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.600]   us and hits us on the very surface of this is that it reminds us that the Christian gospel
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.800]   holds out a hope for everybody.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.960]   Take the case of this woman.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.320]   Here she is, expecting nothing, living a very dread, uninteresting, even sinful life.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.920]   And in the midst of such a life, she is suddenly confronted by someone and something that changed
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.960]   everything for her and opened out to her a new life beyond everything that she could
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.360]   ever have thought of or even imagined.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.600]   And that is why I say we should thank God for this story.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.680]   This is of the very essence of the Christian gospel.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.440]   It is the only thing in the world this morning that offers us a new hope.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.800]   It is the possibility of a new beginning, a new start, an entry into something that
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.580]   is altogether different from everything that we have ever known.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.320]   And therefore I say this is something that surely merits our most careful and close attention
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.200]   and consideration.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.520]   Here we are confronted by this great and amazing and wonderful offer that this gospel
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.000]   makes to mankind.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.660]   So as we come back and consider it again, I would ask the question that I have been
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.700]   asking for a number of weeks.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.520]   Do we know this new life?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.560]   Have we experienced it?
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.320]   Here it is plainly, simply before us.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.520]   And the most important question for every one of us at this moment is simply that.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.320]   Do we know this order and quality of life?
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.440]   Have we experienced it?
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.400]   Now I want to lead you into a further consideration of that very thing.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.240]   We have seen at considerable length many of the hindrances that stand between people in
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.400]   that realization; this story is particularly instructive in that respect.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.600]   The stumbling and the fumbling of this woman, her cleverness, her glibness, her wrong ideas
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.400]   of worship and of God and of so many other things, these are all the things that still
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.240]   stand between men and women in the receiving of this great blessing that the Son of God
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.060]   came into the world to give us.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.200]   And then we saw round about Christmastime, leading up to it and on Christmas Day, that
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.640]   the essential thing above everything else is a realization of who He is.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.080]   And this is the most profound thing we can ever face.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.000]   Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee, am he.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.760]   Without the realization of who He is, there is no hope whatsoever.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.440]   Any uncertainty about the person of our blessed Lord and Saviour makes it quite impossible
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.980]   for us to receive this life, this blessing which He has come to give.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.560]   You can't dissociate Him from His teaching, and every effort to turn the Christian gospel
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.660]   into just the teaching and the view of life fails of necessity at that point.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:12.680]   It is all He Himself, He is bigger than His teaching, He is absolutely essential to it.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   And so we have arrived at this point that we realize that without being clear about
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.040]   Him, who He is, His person and His work, there is no hope whatsoever.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.280]   He has come, as He says, to bring salvation.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.760]   Salvation is of the Jews.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.360]   He was born as a Jew.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.080]   He comes out of that nation, and here He is before us, the Messiah, the Son of God, and
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.640]   He has come to bring salvation to mankind.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.320]   But still, we haven't finished with this subject.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.960]   These in a sense are but the preliminaries that are absolutely essential in this matter.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.920]   There is so much that has to be cleared away.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.960]   We think we are Christians, we think we've got religion, we think we know how to worship,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.000]   we think we know about God, and we have to be put right about all those things.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.080]   And yet we can be put right about those things intellectually and still not know and not
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.960]   experience this great salvation as it is here put before us in the words of our blessed
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   Lord Himself.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.600]   So we've got to come still more directly face to face with this great statement.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.280]   And that is what I'm anxious to do this morning.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.240]   It may be that at the beginning of a new year like this, this is a very good and appropriate
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.920]   time for us to do this very thing.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.960]   It's a time for us to take stock, to examine ourselves.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.600]   We are encouraged to do that in the Scriptures.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   The Apostle Paul says to the Corinthians, "Examine yourselves, prove your own selves,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.000]   whether ye be in the faith or not."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.680]   And it is right that we should do that, and there's no better way of doing that than looking
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:06.100]   at a great statement such as this, and asking ourselves again the question, "Are we possessors
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:13.600]   of this life about which our Lord speaks in these glowing words, 'If thou knewest the
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.760]   gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink,' thou wouldst have asked
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.240]   of him, and he would have given thee living water."
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.040]   He points to the well, saying, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again;
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.200]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:44.280]   water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   life."
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.520]   Now that's the great thing.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.520]   Have we this?
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.240]   Do we possess this?
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   If not, why not?
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:08:00.920]   Now here, you see, we stand directly facing this most crucial question.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.640]   And all I want to do this morning is to show you again some of these things that are absolute
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.240]   essentials with respect to this whole matter.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.680]   And here's the first.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.280]   We must realize our true need.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.400]   I emphasize the word "true."
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.000]   We must realize, I say, our true need.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.340]   I put my emphasis on the word "true" because we are all conscious of many needs.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.720]   We all have many desires.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.800]   There is nobody who is perfectly satisfied.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.000]   There is always something that is lacking, and everybody in the world this morning is
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.480]   aware in some way or another, in that way, of some need or other.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.140]   But that, in a sense, is the greatest danger of all.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:09:01.040]   These other needs very often hide us and hide from us the true need, the basic need.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.480]   And I suppose that in many senses this is the great problem confronting the preaching
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.720]   of the Gospel.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.360]   Yet we are aware, I say, that mankind is aware of many, many needs, and yet the whole time
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:23.000]   is not aware of the true need, the fundamental need, the real need at the center.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.800]   The real danger, therefore, confronting us all, is the danger of just going on living
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.160]   day by day, year after year, taking life as it comes with its ups and its downs.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:43.440]   Aware, as I say, of certain dissatisfactions, aware that everything is not perfect, since
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:50.680]   every man who lives is born to die, and none have known sincere felicity—that's it,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.840]   the poet Dryden puts it quite plainly, quite clearly, it's quite accurate—nobody has
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:03.040]   known sincere felicity, by which he means an unmixed joy, that there is no complete
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.920]   satisfaction.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:11.320]   And the danger is, I say, that we go on living like that, coming to the conclusion that life
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   is like that, and that life always will be and must be like that, and that therefore
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.600]   we can do nothing better than just put up with it, reconcile ourselves to it, and make
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.880]   the best of it, and extract out of it as much happiness and joy and satisfaction as we can
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880]   as we go along.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.480]   Now, that is, I say, the greatest danger confronting every human being in this world.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.880]   And it is the danger that confronts those of us who have become Christian.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:48.400]   For there is ever this danger of just allowing ourselves to go on and to be carried on by
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:56.040]   the sheer momentum of life, but that is why it is essential that we should stop and think
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.140]   and examine ourselves.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:04.920]   And the kind of way in which we can prepare ourselves for this great offer, the way in
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:11.280]   which we can discover our true and our real and our basic need, is to ask certain questions
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:22.720]   such as this—on what are we actually living, by what are we living, on what do we really
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   depend?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.960]   Now, it is extraordinary that one has to put such questions as those, and yet I think you
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:38.240]   will all agree that these are the questions that rarely matter, because unconsciously
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:46.000]   we can be depending on quite a number of things, instead of depending, as we are told here,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.680]   upon our Lord and Saviour.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.840]   There are many dangers confronting us; we all must examine ourselves at this point.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.800]   I wonder whether we are kept going by our own activities, by the various things that
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.560]   we do and have to do.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.660]   It is a question that every one of us should face; I have got to face it as I stand here
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.040]   in this pulpit.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.420]   Am I living on my own activities?
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.920]   Am I living on my own preaching?
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.480]   I ask this question because it has been my lot in life, more than once, to visit men
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.780]   who have spent a lifetime in the ministry preaching and teaching others, who because
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.560]   of ill health or old age can do so no longer, and I have often found such men in a state
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   of depression.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:37.020]   There has only been one explanation, unconsciously they were living on their own activities instead
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.280]   of living on the Lord.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.580]   You can live on your preaching about the Lord instead of living on the Lord himself, and
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.660]   this is something that applies to all of us.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.620]   The very routine of life sustains many people.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.580]   They go on because they have to go on; there are certain things that have got to be done.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.580]   If they don't do them, everything will end in chaos.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:07.620]   So they are kept going by the demands, the needs, the necessities of life and of living,
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:14.380]   and thus they are really kept going by their own activities.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:19.300]   And very often such people, when for various reasons they are no longer able to do these
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.980]   things, again I say illness or accident or something like that, they suddenly find that
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.520]   they have got nothing to rest upon.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:35.940]   Others are kept going by things that happen to them, by events and by circumstances.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:43.860]   And so centrally they have nothing on which they can depend and on which they live, nothing
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.620]   which really ultimately sustains them.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.580]   So I ask that question, what keeps you going?
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.540]   On what are you living?
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.020]   On what do you depend?
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.420]   What's the main spring of your life?
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.700]   Now that's the great question.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:10.060]   Or to put it in a slightly different form, have you a central rest in your life, a place
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:17.700]   of quiet, a place into which you can always retreat amidst all the multifarious activities
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.260]   of life and of business and of affairs?
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:26.100]   Is there a place at the centre where you can always go and where you know that you'll
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:33.740]   have rest and peace and quiet, and you delight in going there because it gives you this ultimate
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.060]   rest of your soul?
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:41.620]   Now, I suppose this is the question of Christians for a busy, bustling age such as this present
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:47.580]   one, that is kept going so much by its own activities, its own bustle and business and
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.460]   life and entertainment.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:59.220]   The trouble today is that men lack tranquillity, they lack a quiet soul, a quiet heart, a peaceful,
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.220]   restful heart.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.140]   And we, as Christians, have got to ask ourselves this very question, because the mere fact
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:12.220]   that we are Christian doesn't guarantee that of necessity we have this quiet heart,
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.220]   this place of rest and of peace and of tranquillity within us.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.500]   Let me put you this question therefore, which I think will help to make it still more plain
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.640]   and clear.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:30.980]   What is the exact difference between us, you and me, as a Christian, and the best type
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.980]   of unbeliever?
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:38.020]   There are men in the world today who are not believers, they deny this Christian faith,
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.820]   but they're good men, they're moral men, they live a good life, they're men of ability
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:48.180]   and of understanding, they're thinkers, they realize the futility of depending upon
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.300]   drink and drugs and pleasure, they're men who've just thought and faced life and have
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.380]   come to certain conclusions and have got a working philosophy of life, and they keep
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.380]   going on that.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.900]   Now, the question I'm asking is, what is the exact difference between you and such
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.060]   a person?
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.220]   Is there a vital difference?
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.700]   Is there an essential difference?
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:17.220]   Or to put it still more directly, we can put it like this, what does the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.460]   himself really mean to us?
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.700]   That is ultimately the real question, the only question that matters.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.420]   We say we believe in him, we've accepted this statement, "I that speak unto thee am he,"
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.620]   very well, we've got correct intellectual views and ideas concerning his person, but
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:45.500]   still the real question, the vital question is, where does he exactly come in our lives,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.700]   in our whole thinking and in our whole being?
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.700]   What does he really mean to us himself?
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:57.520]   Now that is the question that we've got to face.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:05.220]   We shall never know him truly, and we shall never know this experience that he himself
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:14.300]   here describes to the woman of Samaria, until we have realized our deepest need.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:22.900]   And the deepest need is this ultimate rest of the soul, this final peace and quiet and
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:28.880]   confidence and assurance, this ability to stand in the midst of life with all that is
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:36.780]   happening and all that may happen, and know exactly where we are because of our relationship
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.780]   to him.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.160]   Now this, I say, is the real need, the fundamental need, our Lord presses it upon this woman
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:52.460]   in these words, "If thou knowest the gift of God and who it is that speaketh unto thee."
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.460]   That was her trouble.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:59.160]   She was aware of many problems and many difficulties, the kind of life that she was leading, as
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.800]   we've been seeing, of necessity would produce that.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.040]   But you see, she still doesn't know the real need, and that is the whole trouble with
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.480]   the world this morning.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.940]   It doesn't know its central need.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.160]   It's as if only we could have this, if we could have that, if this stopped, if that
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.560]   didn't take place.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.700]   But still, that is not the answer.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.880]   There is this final, ultimate, central need of the soul.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:33.160]   And until we are aware of that, we shall never come to a true understanding of this great
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.880]   offer that is made by the gospel.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.700]   That then being the first principle, we move on to the second one, which is this.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:48.520]   We have to realize also that this is a need which the world can never satisfy, whosoever
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.800]   drinketh of this water shall thirst again.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.880]   Now these are the steps through which the saints of the centuries have always passed
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:07.160]   in coming to this ultimate blessing of the Christian life, this final rest of the soul,
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.200]   this place of peace and of quiet which nothing can disturb.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.920]   You see, that's the thing that our Lord is offering.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:20.680]   He says, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst."
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   That's the place.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.640]   That is what is offered to us.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.600]   But I say, we'll never get there until we realize that this is something that the world
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.560]   can never give us.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.840]   Now this is a specific statement, and it's a very important one.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:43.040]   Our Lord was actually referring, of course, primarily to that well, that actual material
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.360]   well, but he's speaking in parables to the woman.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.280]   He's leading her to the spiritual truth and the spiritual significance of what he's saying,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.960]   and we've got to do exactly the same thing.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:03.000]   Now as Christians, we need to be reminded of this second principle, that the world can
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.920]   never satisfy us, even at its best and at its highest.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.680]   We need to be reminded of this, for the devil is always tempting us, even as Christians,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:21.300]   to find our satisfactions outside the Lord and apart from him.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.520]   He himself has often warned us against this very thing.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.880]   This is the kind of thing that he says to his own followers, to his own people, not
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.640]   to those who are outside.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.720]   He says, "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.960]   surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.360]   for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on all the face of the whole earth.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:55.600]   Watch ye therefore, and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.040]   things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man."
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.880]   You see what he's saying is this, that the cares of this life, and even things which
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:11.520]   are worse, can so keep us from considering him and the state of the soul that when the
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.280]   crisis arrives, we suddenly find that we've got nothing.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.640]   Now the New Testament is full of warnings such as this.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.800]   You remember the parable of the ten virgins, the five wise and the five foolish.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.320]   The foolish virgins thought they were all right, they thought all was well.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.360]   They were not aware that there was any difference between them and the other virgins, and yet
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.920]   when the crisis comes, they suddenly find they've got nothing at all.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:43.760]   It is this kind of negligence, this tendency, I say, to find satisfactions elsewhere that
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.840]   stand between us and the receiving of this great blessing that our Lord offers.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.760]   And you remember what the Apostle Paul has to say about Demas.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:58.320]   Demas was a Christian man, he'd been a follower of the Apostle as a teacher, but he forsook
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   him.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.960]   "He has forsaken me, having loved this present world."
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.320]   Now the danger that I'm trying to indicate is this.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:13.000]   Is the danger of having our Christian faith as just a compartment in our lives?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.040]   Oh yes, we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, we believe that we need
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.140]   salvation, forgiveness, and reconciliation to God, and we're Christians.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.880]   So we give it a place, but the danger is to put it into a compartment.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.560]   We've settled that, we say, there we are, we've become Christians.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.180]   But now the danger is that we go on living the remainder of our lives, and perhaps the
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.240]   bulk of our lives, apart from that.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.540]   That's something to which we return periodically.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.840]   But that's a complete misunderstanding of the Christian faith and the Christian position.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.080]   It's not merely meant to have a place in our lives.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.280]   It is meant to have the central place.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:02.000]   But the danger, often I say, is that we become Christian, and then, quite unconsciously,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.360]   we live the rest of our lives, and the main part of our lives, in terms of the things
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.440]   that the world has got to offer to us.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.280]   Well, I'm not talking about evil things, or sinful things.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.440]   I'm talking about the danger of living on the world at its best.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.320]   We've got this little compartment, which is Christian, but the rest is interested in
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:33.080]   philosophy, politics, art, culture, the various things that the world has got to offer us,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.720]   as I say, at its very best.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.080]   And so often, Christian people are really living on these things, instead of living
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   on their Christian faith.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:51.280]   They've manipulated it in this wrong way, and so, instead of being central, it is merely
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.360]   a compartment in their lives.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.200]   Now, here is a very basic point, which our Lord makes quite plain, "Whosoever drinketh
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.880]   of this water shall thirst again."
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.680]   There is no final satisfaction there, and, of course, it applies not only to the things
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:16.680]   I've mentioned, it applies even to one's family, and to certain relationships in life.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.400]   It is possible for you to be a Christian, and yet rarely to be living on your family,
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:28.240]   on the love of your family, on the relationship in the family, the life of the family.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:35.480]   I think this danger must be plain and clear to all of us, that though we are Christians,
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.320]   we rarely don't rely upon that.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.840]   We tend to rely upon these other things.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.640]   But it is of all these things, even at their very best and at their very highest, that
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:54.440]   our Lord says, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again."
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:01.280]   Now, why does he say that, and on what grounds is that true?
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   We'll never know this well of water springing up into everlasting life until we are perfectly
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:15.040]   clear of the insufficiency of everything else in the world, even at its very best and highest.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.680]   Why is this of necessity true?
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.200]   Well, the answers that he obviously is suggesting are these.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.080]   The first is that all these things only give us temporary relief.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:32.600]   "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again."
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   You take a drink of this water and it satisfies your thirst.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.680]   So you say, "This is fine, this is good, and you're satisfied."
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   But he says, "No, you're not, because this is only a temporary slaking of your thirst.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.520]   It is only a temporary satisfaction."
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.680]   And this is true of everything that the world is going to offer us this morning.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:02.640]   They give immediate and they give temporary satisfaction, but they're not able to do
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.200]   anything beyond that.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.160]   They will, for the time being, help you perhaps to forget your troubles, to forget your problems.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.720]   There are many things that can do that.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.040]   The world knows this.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.160]   That's the secret of pleasure, and pleasure is a business.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.880]   It succeeds because these men who run these things, they know perfectly well that we are
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.560]   going to get temporary relief.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.600]   While you're looking at that film or whatever it is, you're forgetting your troubles and
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.600]   your problems.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.280]   Your mind is directed away from them, and you're happy.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:39.000]   You forget your problems, but then the film ends, and you're left alone, and back comes
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   your problem.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.640]   Now that is something that I'm illustrating in that one respect, but which is true of
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.600]   everything else.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   All that the world can give us at its very best and highest can only give us a temporary
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   satisfaction.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.040]   There is a problem in life and we can get temporary relief, but it is only for the time
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.160]   being.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:07.240]   But beyond that, the world at its best and its highest never can give us real satisfaction
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.280]   for the whole of our being.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.400]   It isn't merely that it's temporary.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.440]   It is that it is never complete, and never fully satisfying.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:26.280]   Now there are many things in the world that can give us intellectual satisfaction.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.180]   That's where your philosophies and other things come in.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:34.780]   There are people who find peace and quiet and rest by their study of thought and systems
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.760]   of thought facing the problems.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.880]   And while they're engaged in that, of course, they're all right.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.680]   Some people do it in terms of crossword puzzles even, and things like that.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.200]   These escape mechanisms, just to get your mind off the problem, off the thing that is
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.920]   difficult and harassing to you.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.040]   So you turn to these things.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.640]   But you see, it's only dealing with one part of you.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.460]   It's only dealing with your mind.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.880]   It doesn't touch your heart.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.960]   It doesn't give you satisfaction down in the depths where your feelings are engaged
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.320]   and involved.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.560]   No satisfaction there.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.840]   But then there are other things that deal with the heart only, and have nothing to give
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   to the mind.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   There are things that can move us emotionally, sentimentally, and so on, and they give us
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   a temporary sense of satisfaction.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   It doesn't touch your heart.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.680]   It doesn't give you satisfaction down in the depths where your feelings are engaged
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680]   and involved.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   No satisfaction there.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.120]   But then there are other things that deal with the heart only, and have nothing to give
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   to the mind.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.640]   There are things that can move us emotionally, sentimentally, and so on, and they give us
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.340]   a temporary sense of satisfaction.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.680]   Now I'm not here to denounce these things.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   All I'm here to say is this, that the mistake, the tragedy, is that men and women tend to
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.840]   live on these things.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.720]   Music can be wonderful.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.200]   Music has germs to soothe that savage breast, and it can soothe many other breasts, and
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   it does.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   Thank God for it.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.840]   There's nothing wrong in these things, all these things that are produced by men and
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   his ability and his culture.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.640]   We should thank God for all these things.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.880]   Yes, I say, but if you depend upon them, if you're living on them, if these are the things
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:18.720]   that keep you going, you're missing the great thing itself, and that is the whole tragedy
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.640]   of mankind this morning.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.100]   People are living on these things, but there is never a complete satisfaction.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.240]   It's only partial, even at its best and at its very highest.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.480]   It never deals with the whole problem.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   Why?
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   Well, because it never deals with the whole of the self.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.000]   And here, you see, is this central message.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.880]   The real problem of men is the problem of self.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:52.600]   Man is not a mere intellect, he's not merely a heart, he's not merely an acting machine.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.880]   There is a wholeness about life.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.120]   It's very difficult to put these things into words, and yet we all know this.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:06.600]   I am, and the totality of my personality is the problem, and unless these things can satisfy
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.520]   me as a whole, well then, finally, they are like this well of water to which our Lord
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   pointed.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.040]   "Whosoever shall drink of this water shall thirst again."
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:24.600]   This is it, that we are individuals, we are entities, and we are selves.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:30.400]   And inevitably, we are face to face with our self at various points.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.080]   We have exhausted what the world can give us, or because of our physical condition or
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.000]   something else, we are no longer able to do these things and to live on these things that
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.120]   the world is offering and suggesting to us, and there, you're left alone.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.800]   Now here is the whole problem of life.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.160]   It's depicted in many, many pictures in the Bible itself.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.920]   One of the greatest, I suppose, one of the most moving of all, is in the case of Jacob.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.520]   On that famous night, when he knew he'd got to meet his brother, Esau, the next morning.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:06.040]   He's done well, he's prospered, he's got his wives and his children, he's got his cattle,
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.160]   he's got his herds, he's got his sheep.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.600]   Jacob was coming back to his homeland, a very wealthy man, he'd gone out as a fugitive,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.760]   as an isolated individual, but here he is, surrounded by all the success and the wealth.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.800]   And yet, the problem remains, he's got to meet Esau, whom he'd wronged.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.840]   And you remember the tremendous story of what happened to him that night.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.040]   There he is, he sends across all his cattle and his sheep and his goods, and then finally
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.680]   his wives and his children, and there is this tremendous statement in the scripture, "And
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.720]   Jacob was left alone."
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.920]   And there is the problem.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.080]   It was the crisis in his life, it was the thing that led to the greatest blessing in
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.880]   his life, but he had to be brought to that.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:58.520]   His danger was, as it's with all of us, to be living on the goods, the possessions,
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:04.120]   the animals, the wives, the children, the family life, all these things.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.160]   But he suddenly realizes that he's alone, Jacob, the individual, the entity, though
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.880]   he owns all this now.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.960]   He's back where he was when he ran away from the anger of his brother on that old occasion.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:25.360]   Jacob was left alone, and every one of us is left alone.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:31.400]   There is that about every one of us, which was true of Jacob on that occasion.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:38.040]   And we experience this from time to time, that all that we have and all that the world
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:43.320]   has given us, or can never give us, can never deal with this problem of the self.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:50.280]   I myself, my whole life, my future, here I am, I stand alone.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.240]   Jacob was left alone.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.000]   And it is because of that, I say, that these are the things that they're best and that
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.160]   they're highest, can never give us a true and a real satisfaction.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.480]   "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again."
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.960]   Now why is this the case?
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.760]   Well, this is the great message, of course, of the whole of the Bible.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:18.720]   This is so because of the nature of men, because we are what we are.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.480]   There's something tremendous about this.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.000]   There is something which should make us all thank God for this, that the world cannot
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   satisfy us.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.680]   If it gives us everything, if it gives us itself, it can't satisfy us.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.600]   What shall it profit a man, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.560]   Yes, that's it.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.280]   Man is too big for this, he's bigger than the universe, he's been made in the image
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.800]   of God, he's bigger than mountains, he's bigger than seas, he's bigger than everything
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.080]   that creation can produce.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:55.480]   He's made in the image and likeness of God, he's made for God, he's too big for the world
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:01.560]   and the world cannot satisfy him, he's got a soul within him.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:10.200]   And that soul can be satisfied by nothing less than God himself and communion with God.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   You see, in our realization of this need, we come to a true understanding of ourselves,
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.920]   our nature, our true being.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.560]   And it's a wonderful thing, this.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.920]   It's painful at first, but once you see it correctly, you see that this is the greatest
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.600]   thing about you, that you're so big that all the world has got to offer can never give
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.200]   you final satisfaction.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.640]   The very nature of man, made in the image of God, makes this inevitable.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.640]   But then you see, on top of this, there is the whole fact of sin, and this aggravates
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   the problem.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:50.080]   Sin in our nature, sin in our acts.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.440]   The prophet Isaiah says the wicked is like the troubled sea when it cannot rest.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   And that's why the world is restless this morning, it's because it's wicked.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.820]   It doesn't know the truth about itself and it's trying to find its satisfactions in these
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.400]   things that can never give it.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:14.600]   So it's restless, left to itself, unhappy, rushing to something else to solace itself,
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.360]   and again finding temporary satisfaction, but only to be left itself again.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:25.320]   And there is this restlessness, this motion, this constant trouble, this seeking for something
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.480]   it cannot find.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.820]   This is the whole story of the human race.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:36.120]   And then, of course, there is the sense of guilt, and the sense of shame, and the sense
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.440]   of failure.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   There is no rest while these things are true.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.160]   There is no philosophy that can satisfy a troubled conscience.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.320]   That is why these things at their best and at their highest cannot ultimately satisfy
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   me.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.200]   My heart can be interested, my heart can be moved, but I'm left again with my problem
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.200]   of myself.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:01.080]   I've only forgotten it while I was enjoying that symphony, whatever it was, but I'm again
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   alone.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   It's ended.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   I'm alone.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   I lie on my bed.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   I'm alone.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.440]   And back it comes, myself, all that is so true of me, my failure, my guilt, my sense of shame.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.240]   And I'm aware within me of this struggle, flesh.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.120]   The flesh lusteth against the spirit of the spirit, lusteth against the flesh.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.080]   That's why man is restless.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:29.320]   And that is why it is true to say this morning that the world, with all that it's got to
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.200]   offer, can never satisfy our needs.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.360]   Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:44.480]   And it's at this point, my dear Christian friends, that we see the real failure of humanism
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.760]   and the so-called good pagan.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.080]   Humanism is popular today.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.520]   People are rejecting this gospel in terms of humanism, but that's the very point at
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.120]   which the humanist fails most of all.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.160]   Of course, he's an intellectualist and he's interested in intellectual gymnastics, is
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.080]   interested in thought, but the day will come when he'll be incapable of doing that.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.440]   He'll be left to himself.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.760]   He still knows it.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:12.800]   He has to turn to other things, to stimulants, to drink, and to drugs, and these other things.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   It's just here.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.880]   He fails most of all at the center of his life.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.680]   You can't live on your interests.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.200]   You can't live on your abilities, because they're all bound to come to an end.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.280]   And in any case, they never give you this complete satisfaction.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.920]   Very well then, I say this is an absolute essential principle in connection with this
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.000]   whole great teaching.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.480]   I've not only got to realize my central need, I've got to realize that it is a need that
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.040]   the universe cannot satisfy.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.120]   If I could possess it all, it wouldn't satisfy me.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:53.960]   There is that within me that cries out for the living God himself.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:38:01.680]   That's my way of saying what Augustine said so perfectly, "Thou hast made us for thyself,
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.220]   and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in thee."
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.000]   And it's true of every one of us this morning.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.480]   You all know this.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.360]   If you could find rest and peace, you'd have found it.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.240]   You can't in and of yourselves, and I've been giving you the reason for that.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:26.440]   And there it is, "Thou hast made us for thyself, and our hearts are restless until they find
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.960]   their rest in thee."
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   My dear friend, are you clear about this?
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:38.380]   Are you clear that the world in its entirety cannot satisfy you, that this need of yours
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:45.640]   is a need beyond the scope and the ambit of the ability of men at his best and at his
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   highest?
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.440]   And that leads me to my third and last principle this morning.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:57.240]   The next thing our Lord points out is that we must realize the possibilities of the Christian
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   life.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.080]   And this is the thing, God willing, that's going to engage us, I hope, for a number of
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.480]   Sunday mornings, the possibilities of the Christian life.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.080]   You know, the mere fact that you're a Christian doesn't mean that you know the possibilities
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   of the Christian life.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.880]   It is because Christians don't know the possibilities of the Christian life that the epistles in
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.300]   the New Testament were all written.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.200]   That's why they became necessary.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.600]   If the moment a man becomes a Christian, he suddenly understood it all and possessed it
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:33.160]   all, he wouldn't have needed all these epistles with their great instruction.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:40.240]   Now, no, we need to be instructed about this, and our Lord gives this instruction to this
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:46.720]   woman of Samaria at this point, and he puts it in these words, "If thou knewest the gift
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   of God, if only you knew."
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:54.320]   But she didn't know it, and I feel that that is his word to us this morning and at the
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.880]   beginning of this new year.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.520]   I believe the greatest danger of Christian people at the present time is the danger of
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:07.200]   limiting this gospel, the danger of reducing these glorious statements to the level of
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.040]   our own little experience.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.720]   My dear people, we are only at the beginning of these things.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.680]   We are but as children paddling at the edge of an ocean, launched out into the deep.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:27.920]   "If thou knewest the depths of what is offered to us in this glorious gospel."
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:36.400]   Now we've got to come to this understanding, "If thou knewest the gift of God."
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   What does he mean by that?
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.000]   Well, there are some of the expositors who say that he's referring to himself there,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.040]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.200]   I reject that for this good reason.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.660]   He goes on to refer to himself afterwards, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.560]   it is that saith unto thee."
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.480]   That's where he's referring to himself.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.840]   So what is the gift of God?
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:05.480]   Well, the gift of God is everything that God has made possible for us in and through the
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.360]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:14.640]   God has treasured and stored up in him all the riches of his wisdom and his grace and
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.160]   his knowledge.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:22.060]   This is the thing to which our Lord is referring, all the blessings that come to us through
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.520]   Christ the Son of God.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:32.200]   This is not merely a matter, you know, of being forgiven.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.800]   This is not merely a matter of taking a decision of becoming a Christian and a member of the
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   Christian church.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   It includes that.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.200]   But that's the mere beginning.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.480]   That's merely entering into the life.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.920]   And the danger is that so many people stop at that.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.640]   They're always looking back to something they once did, to a decision once taken.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.200]   They say, "I became a Christian," and from there on they've never grown, they've never
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   developed.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.040]   They know nothing about all our Lord is speaking about here.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:03.320]   They've reduced the Christian grace and gospel to just this matter of having our sins forgiven
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.720]   and becoming Christians, not doing certain things, but going on living this humdrum,
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.920]   inadequate kind of life that I've been describing.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.360]   That's not the thing, "If thou knewest the gift of God."
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.240]   This is the biggest thing in the universe.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.220]   This is a most glorious life.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.920]   And our Lord says to the woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God."
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.520]   It is a gift from God.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.960]   It is all of God.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.240]   It is of God from the beginning to the end.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:35.720]   The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   Lord.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:42.360]   Christianity doesn't just mean that you live on your own activities, even on your own goodness,
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   on your own striving.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:49.120]   Of course, we've got to do all that, but the essence of this is this, that God gives this,
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:54.360]   "If thou knewest the gift of God."
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.360]   What is it?
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:02.040]   The apostle Paul, in Ephesians 2, talks about the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.840]   That's what it is.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:10.440]   And again, he says in Ephesians 3, that he is privileged to preach among the Gentiles
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.520]   the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.520]   Do you know of them?
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.240]   Are you possessing them?
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.360]   Are you rejoicing in them?
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.200]   Are you thrilled by them?
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.640]   This is the thing, I think, we need to face.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.400]   Do we know this?
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   If thou knewest the gift of God, if only you knew, says our Lord to this woman, and I say
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.040]   this to myself, I say it to you, do you know this?
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   Are you rejoicing in it?
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.400]   Are you thrilled by it, the unsearchable riches of Christ?
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.160]   And are you a pauper?
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:52.040]   Are you living a life of stress and of strain and of unhappiness?
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.640]   The things are not compatible.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.600]   If you are, if there isn't rest, if there isn't peace, if there isn't quiet, if
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.240]   there isn't joy, it's because you don't know the gift of God.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:06.080]   You've reduced the Christian gospel, the offer of salvation in its fullness, just to
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.480]   some little level that is compatible with your thinking.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:15.560]   Oh, my dear friend, here's the word, if thou knewest the things that are possible
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.080]   to you, what a transformation it would produce.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.440]   This is the very thing, it seems to me, the Christian church needs to concentrate on at
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.440]   the present time.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:34.080]   All right, we've been forgiven, let's forget it, I say, and let's go on to perfection.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.520]   Let's know more about the height and the depth and the length and the breadth, and to know
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.760]   the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that we may be filled with all the fullness
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.760]   of God.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   That's Christianity.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:52.440]   That's what our Lord is talking about here, but let me close by just noting these two
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.620]   words that he uses, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:03.040]   thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   what?
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   Living water.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   Living water.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:13.320]   Here's the thing, dear Christian people, that we must know about.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.560]   What does he mean when he calls it living water?
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.480]   He means that it's life-giving, it's enlivening, it's stimulating, it's invigorating.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.980]   Have you got this life in you, or do you have to drag yourself to worship God?
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.520]   You have to drag yourself to live the Christian life.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.660]   Are you a bit ashamed of it when you meet your clever friends in the world?
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.680]   If so, there's something radically wrong.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.800]   It's living water, invigorating, stimulating, life-giving.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:47.060]   It isn't some cold, unmoved, detached, theoretical, intellectual understanding of a number of
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.060]   doctrines.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.360]   It is that, but if it doesn't give life to you, if it doesn't enliven you, if it doesn't
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:58.000]   move you, if it doesn't invigorate you, you haven't got the living water.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   What else?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.280]   Well, it's always fresh.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.320]   It's not a cistern.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.080]   It's not static water.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.760]   It's living water.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:15.040]   It comes out of a well, opened on Calvary's Hill, opened in the heart of God, and it's
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:21.500]   flowing, and it constantly comes with its new stream, always fresh, always living.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.600]   It's not like water stored in a tank, and so much Christianity seems to be just that,
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   doesn't it?
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:36.280]   It's stale, it's old, it's infected, it's dull, it's lifeless, it's insipid.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.680]   You feel it needs to be purified, and the world isn't interested in it because it looks
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:46.000]   at it, and it sees the scum on the surface, and it sees all things that shouldn't be there.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.600]   It doesn't see the sparkle.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.240]   It doesn't see the life, the freshness, the living quality.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:58.560]   Oh, what a travesty all this is of the true Christian life and of the true Christian message.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.640]   It's a sparkling water.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.120]   It's a living water.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.760]   And lastly, it is something that lasts.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:15.240]   "Whosoever shall drink of this water shall thirst again, but not with this other."
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.400]   This is living water, it lasts.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.640]   Whatever may happen in life, whatever may happen in the world, in the whole cosmos,
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.220]   nothing can stop this.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.640]   It springs up into everlasting life, it goes on.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.840]   There'll never be a shortage, there'll never be a drought, there'll never be a
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.360]   lack of supply.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.960]   Well, my dear friends, here it is.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:44.720]   I just want to end by asking you a question in the form of quoting a hymn to you.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.000]   Have you got this living water?
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   That's the question.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.120]   I'm not asking you about your beliefs at the moment, I'm assuming them.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.560]   I'm asking you, have you got living water, have you got life?
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   Is there this sparkle in you?
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.080]   Is there this invigorating water in you?
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.280]   Not merely your thirst is satisfied, you have been given life, vigor, power.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.760]   You're ready to meet the world, the flesh, and the devil, and anything that may come
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.680]   against you in this year, and in all the years that may be left to you.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.160]   Have you got it in you?
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.240]   Here's the question.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.520]   Can you say something like this this morning?
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:30.360]   "O Christ, in thee my soul hath found and found in thee alone the bliss, the peace,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:35.900]   the joy, the bliss I sought, the bliss till now unknown.
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:43.600]   Now none but Christ can satisfy none other name for me as life, and love, and lasting
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   joy.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:52.080]   Lord Jesus, found in thee, I sighed for rest and happiness."
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   That's it.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.760]   That's the wells of the world, seeking rest, seeking happiness.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.960]   I sighed for rest and happiness.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.560]   I yearned for them, not thee.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   That's the thing I've been trying to say.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.360]   Don't seek them, seek him.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.080]   I sighed for rest and happiness.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.320]   I yearned for them, not thee.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:19.520]   But while I passed my Savior by, his love laid hold on me.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.680]   He must needs go through some area.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:28.480]   God seeketh such to worship him.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.800]   His love laid hold on me.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:38.040]   I tried the broken systems, Lord, but all the waters failed.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   Even as I stooped to drink, they fled, and mocked me as I wailed.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.280]   And that is what the world ultimately does to us.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.680]   In your need, in your failure, it'll mock you, it'll laugh at you, it'll jeer at you.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.520]   It has no use for failures, it'll pass you by and leave you.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:07.920]   But thank God, our Savior is the one who must needs go through some area, meets this woman
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:13.080]   as she was, and gives her this living water.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:19.800]   Now, none but Christ can satisfy none other name for me.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:29.200]   There's life and love and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, found in thee.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.980]   If thou knewest the gift of God, do you know it?
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:37.280]   Have you asked for it?
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:44.680]   Have you received it?
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.600]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
