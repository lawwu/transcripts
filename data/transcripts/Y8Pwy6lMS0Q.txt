[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.100]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with a longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.080]   We recently received an anonymous question from an international listener to the podcast
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.800]   who emails us and who listens from a rural region in Nigeria.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.360]   Amazing.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.340]   And it's a very simple but profoundly important question that all of us, all of us must answer
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.880]   at some point in our lives.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.320]   Here it is.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.720]   Pastor John, how do I know if I'm ready for heaven?
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.760]   Well, I love that somebody asks this simple, basic question because it gives me a chance
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.360]   to go right to the heart of the Bible, right to the heart of the best news in all the world
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.040]   that we call the gospel, namely that nobody is fit for heaven.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.620]   Nobody is ready for heaven.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.740]   Nobody deserves heaven.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:15.560]   Nobody can expect to go to heaven unless God steps in and provides a way by grace, grace,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   and by mercy that through faith, not through my good deeds or my merit, could get me there.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.320]   And that's exactly why the Bible was written.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.880]   That's why Jesus came into the world.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.820]   That's why there's a history of salvation.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.720]   The most important part of the Bible that explains this is, I think, the letter to the
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.760]   Romans written by the apostle Paul.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.520]   So if you want one short book, I mean, 16 chapters, but you can read it in an hour,
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.880]   to explain all this, go to Romans.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.560]   What he shows there first is that, and we know this, everybody knows this if we're
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.800]   honest with our conscience, every human being has sinned, he said, that is failed to live
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   for God, to honor God, to glorify God.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   We're all selfish.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   Yes, we are.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.840]   All of us were born that way.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.400]   And then he says, by works of the law, that is, if you try to keep a list of deeds that
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.160]   God requires, no human being will be justified in God's sight.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.040]   In other words, you'll never be right with God if you try to go the law keeping route.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.600]   That's Romans 3, verse 20.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.640]   And then we learned the breathtaking news that even though none of us deserves heaven,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.000]   none of us is fit for heaven, none of us is ready for heaven in our own selves.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.080]   Nevertheless, God made a way for us sinful human beings to be accepted as righteous.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.080]   Believe it.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.600]   Righteous, good, just, law abiding, accept us as righteous in his presence.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.160]   Now, how in the world can that be?
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.120]   That's the great gospel mystery.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.800]   How can that be?
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.760]   How can a sinner, guilty, shameful failure like me be accepted by a perfectly good and
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.160]   holy and just judge of the universe?
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.080]   And we all know that's the way he is.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.320]   Our conscience is dictated to us.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.900]   He's perfectly righteous.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.920]   How can I ever be accepted as good and perfect and holy as his child in his very presence?
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Wow.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.320]   How can that be?
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:50.080]   And the answer of the Bible is God puts my sin, all our sin, whoever trusts him, he puts
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:59.520]   all our sin on Jesus and puts Jesus perfection and righteousness on us.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:08.040]   Way back 700 years before Jesus came into the world, Isaiah 53, verse 4 prophesied,
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.900]   he, that is the coming Messiah, Jesus, he was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.000]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.200]   All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.440]   We've turned everyone to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.240]   That's the best news in the world to me when my conscience condemns me at night and I know
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:43.320]   I've sinned and I hear the words, he laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.720]   And not only this, it gets better.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.400]   Not only were my sins put on Jesus, but his perfection, his righteousness, Jesus never
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.780]   sinned in the slightest.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.960]   His righteousness is counted by God as mine.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.560]   In 2 Corinthians 5, 21, for our sake, God made him to be sin.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.160]   He made him to be sin.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.560]   He treated him as sin.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:22.200]   He put our, our sin on him who knew no sin so that in him, we might become who are very
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   sinful.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.760]   We might become the righteousness of God.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.640]   That's what the Bible calls justification, being declared just or declared righteous
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:43.120]   in God's presence on the basis of the justice and the righteousness of Jesus, not ourselves.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.440]   That's the great exchange.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.560]   That's the great glorious mystery of how a sinner can be accepted in the presence of
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.560]   God.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.440]   So to say it again, in him, we become the righteousness of God in him.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.260]   And that's an utterly crucial phrase in him.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.240]   We become righteous before God.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:13.000]   That means that the righteousness that enables us to be accepted 100% accepted by God is
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.280]   not our own righteousness.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.720]   It is the perfect righteousness of Christ who never sinned so that the foundation of
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.120]   our acceptance with a perfectly holy God is flawless, perfect, unshakable outside us as
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.440]   long as we are in him.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   So the major question of life is what must I do to be in Christ so that his life, his
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.940]   death counts for me?
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.740]   What must I do to be saved from my sins like this?
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.420]   What must I do to enjoy the hope of heaven and eternal life and joy in God's presence
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.420]   like this?
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:03.260]   And the glorious biblical New Testament gospel answer is you don't do anything to earn it.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.780]   You don't do anything to show yourself good enough to have it.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.660]   Christ has already done what needs to be done.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:21.820]   What we must do is stop doing in order to earn anything and instead receive, that's
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:30.940]   the key word, receive Christ who did all the doing that had to be done as the foundation
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.300]   of our acceptance with God.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:41.140]   Any doing that God expects of us now, and he does, any doing that God expects of us
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:54.940]   now is because we are accepted 100%, not in order to be accepted 1% or any percent.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:02.860]   So we live out of our acceptance with God, which is through faith in Christ.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.280]   So we receive Jesus as a precious savior.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.140]   We receive him as a perfect Lord.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.340]   We receive him as an infinite treasure.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.300]   And the way the Bible talks about this is we must believe in him.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   Believe.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.340]   That's what receive is.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.200]   This doesn't mean merely believe facts about him because the devil believes all the facts
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.420]   about Jesus and he's not saved.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.000]   Believing is receiving him for who he is, for the treasure that he is.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.960]   Receiving is what Paul expresses in Philippians 3, 8, when he says, I count everything as
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:46.340]   loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ, my Lord, for his sake, I have
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.740]   suffered the loss of all things.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.140]   I count them as rubbish in order to gain Christ.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:57.700]   So receiving Jesus is receiving him as that kind of treasure.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:06.360]   And of course, if faith is that kind of joyful embrace of Jesus, it changes us in this life.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.080]   If it doesn't change us, James says, it's dead, dead faith and dead faith doesn't save
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   any body.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   It's not real.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.920]   But of course, being changed in this life doesn't mean perfection.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.340]   Oh, that's so important for people to hear.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.520]   Think of it this way.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:33.660]   When you put your trust in Christ, your life takes on a new direction, not a new perfection.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:40.900]   The river turns, but it doesn't yet run with perfectly pure water.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.580]   The perfection is Jesus.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:51.400]   And then when we die or when Jesus comes back, we will share in that complete perfection.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:10:00.880]   So let me just end by giving you a belief bath, a belief bath, meaning that for one
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:07.820]   minute as I close, I want to just bathe you with passages from the Bible that tell you
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.160]   how to be in Christ where all these treasures are found.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:20.460]   Namely, believe John 1 12, to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.680]   gave the right to become the children of God.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.360]   John 3 16.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.800]   God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.880]   perish but have eternal life.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.620]   John 3 36.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.420]   Whoever believes in the sun has eternal life.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.280]   John 11 25.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.760]   Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.080]   Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.800]   Acts 10 43 to Jesus.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.240]   All the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.440]   sins.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.400]   Acts 16 31.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.120]   Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.520]   Romans 10 9.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.640]   If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.600]   raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:17.800]   And one more with the reminder that it is in Christ in relation to him that we have
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.120]   our readiness for heaven.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.280]   Galatians 3 26.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.760]   In Christ, you are all sons of God through faith.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:37.200]   So let me end with the words of the Bible itself in 2 Corinthians 5 20.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.760]   To every person who's listening to me, I speak this as personally as I can.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.200]   I implore you on behalf of Christ.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.400]   I'm speaking for Christ now.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.760]   Be reconciled to God.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.760]   Amen.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.040]   Thank you for that gospel.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.080]   Grace bath, Pastor John.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.440]   And if you have a question for us, if you have a question for Pastor John, you can email
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.400]   it into me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.

[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   that.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.960]   Thank you for listening and for making the podcast a part of your life wherever you are.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.040]   And to our international listeners outside of the United States, it's always great to
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.960]   hear from you and to get your questions.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.720]   Of course, you can find our audio feeds and our episode archive and you can reach us through
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:30.440]   email all through our online home@desiringgod.org forward slash askpastorjohn.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:37.520]   Really what our ministry is all about is helping people get ready for, by grace, eternity.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.560]   But what if this life turns out to have been meaningless?
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.040]   What if this life is mere vanity?
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.320]   What if all the things that we do all day, all of our work and our homework and our friendships
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.400]   and our loves and our activities and everything that we spend so much time consumed with,
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.080]   what if it's all pointless in the end?
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.000]   This is a question we get on occasion and we'll address it soon.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.160]   It's a heavy question, but it's a necessary one that we need to ask and we need to answer
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.280]   from scripture, which we will do on Wednesday.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.200]   We'll see you then.
