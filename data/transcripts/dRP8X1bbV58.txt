[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.080]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.440]   That's what you just heard in Portuguese from our friend Vinny.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.440]   What a voice.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.000]   Vinny brings this podcast and a host of Desiring God books and resources to the people of Brazil.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.920]   You'll hear more about his work in just a moment.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.040]   But first, today's question comes to us from a podcast host by the name of Tony.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   From me.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.480]   I've got a question, Pastor John, that's been on my mind and it's something I'm trying to
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480]   figure out.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.200]   It's about one of the most remarkable statements in the Bible when it comes to this topic about
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   God's sovereign design and our suffering.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.200]   Job 13, 15 is the text I'm thinking about.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.160]   Job says, "Though he slay me, I will hope in him."
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.080]   Though he slay me, I will hope in him.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.800]   A remarkable line made famous in more recent times by Shane and Shane in their incredible
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.720]   and powerful song by that title, "Though You Slay Me."
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.320]   Years back, Desiring God partnered with them to record a new edition of the music video
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.900]   that featured a sermon clip of yours, a remix that we published in ABJ 639.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.200]   The music video version of that song now has a whopping nine million views on YouTube and
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200]   counting.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200]   That's incredible.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   Huge response.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.880]   So here's my question about Job 13, 15.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.120]   I know you've made passing mentions over the years to this phrase, "Though he slay me,"
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.040]   but I see only one explicit mention of the text in your entire ministry corpus from one
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.040]   of your earliest sermons, preached seven and a half years before you even became a pastor,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.200]   a sermon titled "Your Calamity" in 1973, preached on New Year's Eve 1972 in Greenville, South
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.720]   Carolina.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.280]   As we approach another new year and the 50th anniversary of that sermon, I see that you've
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.120]   never mentioned the text again in a sermon, and you've never tweeted the line either,
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.680]   a text that just seems to be primed for short-form context.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.400]   In mid-November, when your annual Bible reading trek takes you through Job 13, you tweeted
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.280]   a couple other verses from the chapter, like verses 5 and 24, but never Job 13, 15.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.360]   The meaning of the text is debated.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.480]   So where do you land now?
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   Are you certain or uncertain of its meaning?
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   And with such a text that has become synonymous with Desiring God, why the silence?
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.880]   Wow, Tony with a thorough question today.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.960]   I'm laughing here, Tony, because you know too much.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.080]   I can't believe that everything I've ever said is searchable.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.840]   I'm going to be caught into a thousand contradictions one of these days.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.640]   Well, see, you're still with us, so now we can present them to you.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.680]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.400]   The first thing to say is that I love the truth, and it is the truth spoken from God's
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:18.240]   own mouth that God in His absolute ownership and sovereignty over all life appoints the
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:27.400]   time and the kind of every death of every person on this planet, and this fact of God's
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.320]   right to give and to take life is not a reason to reject Him, but a reason to hope in Him.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.880]   I love that truth.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.640]   Which means that I love the fact that every Christian owned by the Creator, doubly owned
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.040]   by the Redeemer, can say and should say, "Though He slay me, I will hope in Him."
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.800]   Yes, we can say that.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.440]   We should say that.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.160]   That is the ESV of Job 13.15, virtually the same as the NIV, virtually the same as NASB,
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.680]   King James Version.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:16.760]   If the declaration that God slays, that is, takes the life of His own precious children—and
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.800]   I don't doubt that Job was a precious blood-bought child of God, the blood of Jesus going back
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.680]   over the Old Testament and covering all the saints' sins, as it says in Romans 3.25—I
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.880]   don't doubt that—if that declaration that God takes the life of His people, and while
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.360]   He does it, we ought to keep hoping in Him, trusting in Him, loving Him, treasuring Him,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.600]   if that declaration seems foreign to us or unbiblical to us or contrary to God's nature,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.920]   then we have not been paying attention to our Bibles or thinking rightly about what
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.080]   we are reading, including the book of Job.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.720]   In the very first chapter of Job, God takes the life, takes the life—if you'd use
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.120]   the word "kills"—all ten of Job's children.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.120]   Job saw this.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.520]   Job saw this, and he confessed that fact, tore his clothes, shaved his head, fell on
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:37.300]   the ground, and said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.120]   The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.320]   Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.920]   That's Job 121, a breathtaking statement of worship.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.360]   "The Lord has taken my ten children away.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.120]   Blessed be His name."
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.680]   Sometimes people say, "Yeah, but Job was a bad theologian at that point."
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:11.560]   No, the inspired writer comments in the next verse that Job did not sin with his lips when
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.720]   he said that, as if he knew what people would think when they read it.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.800]   It was true, godly worship.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:31.320]   Then in Job 12.10, he said, "In God's hand is the life of every living thing and
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.600]   the breath of all mankind."
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.000]   God owns all things.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.920]   He has absolute rights over all living things.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.320]   He gives, he takes, when and how he decides in his infinite wisdom.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.760]   This is part of what it means to be God, the creator and sustainer and governor of all
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   things.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:06.440]   Deuteronomy 32.39 says, "See now," this is God talking, "See now that I, even I
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.400]   am He, and there is no God besides me.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.120]   I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.880]   There is none that can deliver out of my hand."
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.800]   Now, Tony, you know that I wrote a book on Providence recently.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:38.200]   50 pages, 5-0, 50 pages of that book are devoted to this one single biblical reality, section
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   5, called "Providence over Life and Death."
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:51.080]   Dozens and dozens of texts say this, like James 4.15, "Don't presume upon tomorrow.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:59.200]   Instead you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live,' and do this or that."
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   If the Lord wills.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.960]   John Piper will live to the end of this podcast.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.240]   If the Lord does not will it, then this microphone goes silent and you're going to wonder what
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.820]   happened.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.620]   Another minute of life, and it's the Lord's will or not.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.140]   If he wills, we live.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.280]   If he doesn't will it, we die.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:29.960]   So whether the text of Job 13.15 has become synonymous with desiring God, the reality
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:37.760]   has, and I am glad because it is true, and it is glorious.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:48.460]   I mean, really, whom would you like to be in charge of your martyrdom or your cancer?
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.620]   Satan?
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.780]   You want Satan to be in charge of your cancer?
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.660]   You want fate to be in charge of your cancer?
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.300]   Meaningless, mindless, purposeless forces of nature?
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:10.160]   It is a glorious thing that not a single sparrow falls from the sky apart from our Father in
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:19.440]   heaven, and how much more certainly does he govern the death of his precious children.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.040]   Even the hairs of our head are all numbered.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.160]   "Fear not," Jesus says, "you are of more value than many sparrows."
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.400]   That's Matthew 10, 28 to 31.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:39.600]   So it is our joy at desiring God to say, "Though my flesh and my heart may fail, God is the
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.680]   strength of my heart and my portion forever."
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.840]   Psalm 73.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:51.120]   We love to say, "To live is Christ and to die is gain," Philippians 1.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:58.960]   We love to say, "Apart from the body, at home with the Lord," 2 Corinthians 5.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:06.840]   We love to say, "The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life, better than being
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.280]   kept alive."
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.200]   So the sentence, "Though he slay me, yet I will trust him," is a beautiful expression
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.640]   of reality and biblical faith.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:27.680]   God does take the life of his people, and they have every reason to keep on hoping in
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:36.400]   him not in spite of that fact, but because of that fact, that he is the all-wise, all-loving,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:46.440]   purposeful God doing nothing from any mistake or any lack of wisdom or any lack of love.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.880]   Satan doesn't have the final power over death.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.320]   Disease doesn't have the final power over death.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.920]   Natural disasters don't have the final power over death.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.680]   Life and death are in the hand of God, finally, and he is our Father and our Redeemer.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.440]   By the blood of his Son, he reached back, covered all of our sins, and by the resurrection
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.880]   of his Son, he has conquered death.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.400]   The reason, Tony, that I have not made Job 13.15, "Though he slay me, yet will I hope
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.640]   in him," the touchstone of my exaltation in this glorious truth of God's sovereignty
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:35.840]   and our hope is that I knew that if I put too many eggs in that textual basket, someone
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:44.160]   could come along and make a plausible case that I'm building on sand, because the RSV,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:54.800]   for example, translates the verse like this, "Behold, he will slay me, I have no hope,"
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:01.640]   which sounds like the very opposite of other translations, "Though he slay me, yet I
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.080]   will hope in him."
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:15.880]   The problem is there is a real textual, Hebrew textual problem in this verse.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:23.020]   There are two Hebrew variants pronounced exactly alike, namely lo.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:30.800]   One variant has the Lamed Holim aleph and means "no," and the other variant has
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:37.600]   Lamed Holim vav and means "to him" or "in him."
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:45.960]   So the readings are "I have hope in him" or "I have no hope," and I have not
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   been able to have certainty in my mind as I've worked and worked over the years on
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.360]   the Hebrew which one the author intended.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.880]   If the correct variant is "I have no hope," it doesn't have to mean, I don't
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.400]   think it would mean, "I have no hope beyond grave," because that would contradict
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:16.200]   Job 19.26, "After my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God."
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.600]   Job I do believe was granted insight into eternal life.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.560]   All it would mean is, "If God slays me now, my hope for vindication on the earth
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.840]   is over.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.440]   My hope for restored fortunes is over.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.680]   It's gone.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.960]   Life here is over.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.880]   Not going to have a daughter named Jemima.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.640]   It's over."
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.640]   And that's true.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.120]   That would have been true, and it would not have been hopeless.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.000]   Just no hope for vindication here and now.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.640]   Now, conclusion.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.240]   I think the traditional translation, "Though he slay me, I will hope in him," is the
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   right one.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.720]   If you put a gun to my head and said, "You got to vote," I'm voting for the traditional
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.920]   translation.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.640]   I'm glad the ESV translates it that way.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:12.120]   I know - now, I don't just think - but I know that it expresses biblical truth.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.440]   The traditional translation expresses biblical truth.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:24.360]   But I have chosen over the years to defend and exalt in that glorious biblical truth
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:30.600]   from dozens of other passages where I know the rug won't be pulled out from under my
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.920]   exegetical feet.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.240]   Yeah, I had a sense something was up.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.160]   Thank you, Pastor John, for the clarity on Job 15.13.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.480]   Well, as you heard at the beginning of this episode, we have a team of friends laboring
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.560]   to bring Desiring God resources to non-English speakers, and that includes Vinny, who serves
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.360]   the people of Brazil.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.320]   You heard his voice at the beginning of this episode, but we asked him for an update on
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.320]   his work.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.440]   Here's what he said.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   My name is Vinny.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.160]   I work as an editorial manager at Fiel Ministries in Brazil.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.400]   We have 104 articles per year.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:12.280]   We have 52 short clips, videos, and 52 "Ask Pastor John" dubbed in Portuguese every year.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.080]   On top of that, the publishing have been doing Piper's book for a long, long time.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.640]   I believe we have around 15 to 20 Piper's books.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:27.640]   I know many pastors that they're not trying to emulate Piper, but they've been so enriched
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.680]   with Piper's message that when you hear them, you can hear echoes of Piper.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.360]   I see that in my preaching sometimes.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:40.960]   When we entered the pandemic, and coronavirus and Christ was such a helpful content, many,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:49.920]   many people wrote letters when they were losing relatives in the midst of depression, panic,
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   anxiety.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   And then recently we published Good News of Great Joy, devotionals for Christmas season,
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.960]   and people were rejoicing in that.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.320]   We were giving the book for free.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.360]   You know, Desiring God produces a content that is just timely.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.560]   You know, how it speaks the perfect timing for coronavirus and Christ, the perfect timing
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.120]   for Good News of Great Joy.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:20.880]   I feel that many people kind of had their relationship with God just transformed because
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.360]   of thinking God as our source of our joy.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.000]   I want to express my thankfulness for each one of you that has been investing in Desiring
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.080]   God, because as a partner of Desiring God here in Brazil, I see many of the results
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.920]   of that content being produced there and being translated here.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:46.760]   And to have those things dubbed to Portuguese, which usually is going to take a lot of effort
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.160]   and a lot of resources, and because of your donation, people in Brazil can savor that
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:59.120]   in their own local language so they can be equipped to live the Christian life in a way
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.360]   that is both Christ-honoring and biblical.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.320]   Amazing testimony.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.120]   My wife and I were honored to meet and spend time with Vinny and his wife in Brazil in
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.960]   June, and they inspire us in gospel ministry.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.360]   An amazing couple.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.400]   I wish you all could meet them personally.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   If you're listening right now and you've already invested in Desiring God, you are impacting
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   Vinny's life right now by helping to make his gospel labors possible.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.240]   All that you just heard is because of you and what you gave in 2022.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   So thank you.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.020]   And if you're not yet a partner with us and you want to join in what's happening through
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:40.360]   Desiring God in the English-speaking world and how that work overflows into Vinny's work
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.400]   to reach the Portuguese-speaking world in Brazil, join us today.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.520]   Become a monthly ministry partner.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:52.320]   Much of our financial support comes from friends of ours who give on average $30 a month to
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.280]   support all of our work.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.760]   To set up monthly giving, go to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   That's give.desiringgod.org.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.320]   I'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.380]   you
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.440]   you
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.500]   you
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
