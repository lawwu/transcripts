[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:56.960]   [Music]
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.280]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today is Tuesday, February 17, 2015.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.520]   Today I bring you an interview with financial planner extraordinaire Michael Kitsis, one of the more well-known writers in the financial planning space.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.200]   He writes at kitsis.com.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.560]   This is a repeat appearance for him on the Radical Personal Finance Podcast and today we're going to talk about his career.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.600]   [Music]
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   I had the opportunity to interview Michael when I was out in Dallas last week at the T3 Technology Tools for Today conference for financial advisors.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.160]   I jumped on a plane real quick and shot out there and one of the things that I was able to do was to do a bunch of really great interviews.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.440]   Most of them are very focused on the financial advisor space and you'll hear that in this interview.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.080]   This interview essentially follows two parts.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.800]   The first part is a discussion of Michael's career and especially as it relates to conferences.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.360]   I thought this was such a timely topic in light of yesterday's show and in light of some things that I've been wanting to bring you here on the show,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.680]   of just talking about the importance of conferences as they might be for your career.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.640]   I thought it was a useful story of how careers can develop, even if by accident.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.200]   Now, one of the cool things, if you know something can develop by accident, what about developing it on purpose?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.840]   That's what we can choose to do.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.200]   I want you to listen to Michael's story.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.480]   That's the first part of the interview.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.480]   The second part of the interview talks a little bit about marketing for financial advisors.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.160]   If you're not interested at all in marketing or interested in the financial advisory space, feel free to skip the second half of the interview.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:47.440]   But if you ever have thought about being involved in any kind of business, you might want to know some of the information in that marketing space.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.240]   Especially if you're a financial advisor, you might want to know about that.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.480]   This is Michael's second appearance on the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.640]   If you're interested in listening to his previous interview on the show, that was episode 92, which we titled, "The Business of Financial Advice.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.360]   Opening the Curtain on the History, the Present State, and the Future of Financial Advice."
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.440]   You can find that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/92.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.960]   And now, as we go to the interview, I just want to say thank you to the patrons of the show.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.920]   Thanks to the patrons of the show, I'm able to present this to you commercial-free.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.960]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen who support the show.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.000]   Here's Michael.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.960]   So, Michael, welcome back to the show.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.920]   I'm glad to have you here.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.560]   Thank you.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.360]   Welcome to be back.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   Welcome to be back.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.800]   Good to be back.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.120]   It's been a long three days.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   So, for those who are catching up with us, it's day three of a conference.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.400]   You can tell by the fact that my words do not sequence properly anymore.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.080]   But yes, here we are.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.360]   And these things are hard work.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.400]   What time do you start?
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.560]   Early in the morning and it goes till midnight, right?
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.480]   Also, this conference is kind by some because at least the sessions don't really get started until eight.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.980]   Right.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.000]   But yeah, then sessions go until four or five in the afternoon.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.920]   And then you do evening gatherings and you're being social and you're networking.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.440]   You're connecting with people.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.800]   Yeah, I probably got to sleep after midnight last night.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.440]   And yeah.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.720]   So, it's a work.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.520]   It's not a vacation.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.400]   It's definitely work.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.280]   Yeah, it's definitely work.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's not vacation.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.560]   Like, and I, you know, we'll probably talk about this later.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   But it drives me nuts watching people who go to conferences.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.920]   And it's like, "Hey, what did you think of the sessions?"
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.440]   "Oh, I didn't see them because like I went up and I played golf for three hours because
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.120]   there's a cool golf course nearby."
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.520]   Like, "All right, like power to you for loving your golf and hitting the back nine for a
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.160]   couple hours."
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.080]   But like, you're here at a conference.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.040]   You will not have a better opportunity to meet and connect with a whole bunch of people
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.960]   that can improve your business and career.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.560]   And like, you're hitting the links for a couple hours because there's a neat course nearby
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.520]   you haven't played.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.440]   And well, like certainly in our advisor world, like we, a lot of golf lovers.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.840]   Absolutely.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.800]   Popular thing here.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.160]   So, that's a perfect place to start.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.480]   When you started your career in the financial advisor space, you were pretty green, right?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.880]   You would...
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.360]   Like, I came straight out of college.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.680]   Like, graduated Saturday above Memorial Day weekend, packed my stuff on Sunday, drove
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.800]   home on Memorial Day Monday, Tuesday morning at 8 a.m. showed up at the office for my first
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560]   job in the financial services industry.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.760]   So, I could not have packed it closer.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.560]   At what point in time did you start going to conferences?
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   First four years in before I ever went to my first conference, my first event of any
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.600]   sort.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.360]   And was really ignorant of the opportunity, the value, the possibilities.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.880]   I'll give them full credit.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.680]   I went to my first conference because the firm I was working for said, "You're going
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.880]   to go to a conference this year.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.680]   So, let us know which one you want to go to and that's the one you'll go to."
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.040]   And I'd pick something that sounded interesting in our industry.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.320]   So, like, I didn't send myself.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.600]   I didn't pay my way.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.800]   They paid for me to go.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.000]   Even though it was available for me, they basically had to, like, give me a kick to
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   tell me, like, "So, you're going to go to something this year.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.840]   Just let us know what it is."
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.320]   So, I was completely ignorant to the possibilities, what was out there, much less the value
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.400]   proposition of going and doing something like that.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.280]   And for your first one, did you just show up, you know, maybe sit in the back with a
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.360]   notebook type of thing or were you very active and engaged and making full use of the time?
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.200]   So, it's kind of a weird blend.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   So, yeah, like, I was certainly there as a bit of a wallflower.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.880]   And frankly, like, I'm actually very much an introvert by nature.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.480]   So, like, I love the blogging world because I could sit in my computer on my four walls.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.320]   And like, even, so even conferences for me, like, as an introvert, like, I enjoy coming
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.840]   here, I do enjoy connections, but I'm much more small intimate groups than large groups.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.800]   Like, conferences are actually very draining for me.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.640]   So, like, you know, I get to the end of the day at the conference and I need to go upstairs
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.320]   and just, like, decompress in my room for an hour and, like, get my head sorted back
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.240]   together before I can even relax and go to sleep.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.720]   So, yeah, so going to my first conference in particular being some combination of introverted
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.000]   and shy and just young, young dude.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.800]   I mean, I was 24, 25 in an industry where even then the average age was probably 50.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.000]   Now we're, like, mid-50s.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.240]   Right.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.960]   So, yeah, like, I was, you know, a wallflower, newbie, young dude.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   I looked it, it showed.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:31.680]   Now, the weird thing that came from that is the first conference I went to, I end, you
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.840]   know, you go to a conference, you end up making connections with people like you, like, the
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.280]   sort of what we seek out.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.600]   So, finding people like me was really easy.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.480]   There were four of us at the conference under the age of 40.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.400]   It was probably, well, how old I had been, like, 26 or something, 25 or 26 at the time.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.840]   So, there were four of us under 40.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.080]   So, it was not easy, it was not hard to find the other three and form a connection with
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.480]   them.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.960]   And so, we made a connection.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.720]   We sort of said, like, hey, this is actually supposed to be an advanced planners conference,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.080]   like, future of the profession.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.840]   There literally is no one here who will be in the profession in the future because 99%
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   of the people are over the age of 40 and they're only going to be here so long.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.160]   Like, we should make a group for people like us to try to draw other people out for this.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.880]   And so, literally, like, my first conference out of the gate, we founded a group called
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.680]   NextGen for next generation of financial planners.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.640]   That was a little over 10 years ago.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.120]   There are now 2,000 members in NextGen.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.800]   It's a massive, like, growing movement thing across financial planning around the country.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.720]   And it was just like, yeah, I showed up at a conference and there were three other people
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.120]   like me.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.640]   So, we said, hey, we should hang out.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   Next thing you know, this thing got created.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:52.080]   So, and just like that itself was very impactful on my career overall.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.000]   It plugged me into a world of working with next generation financial planners, being
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.680]   a next generation financial planner.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.520]   I've founded two or three different businesses off of serving that group now of my peers.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.680]   Like, just that one moment, literally, from the first conference has been massively formative
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.800]   on my entire career.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.760]   And in addition to those businesses now, you're a sought after speaker, making substantial
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.360]   speaking fees and you speak at 50, 60 conferences a year?
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.120]   I've done almost 70 for the year, for the past two years.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.880]   I'm trying to, my goal this year is basically to cut it back to 50.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.360]   And I keep raising speaking fees and people keep saying yes.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.200]   So, like, nice business problem to have.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.320]   But I'm still doing even more travel than I want to do because it just, it works well.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.280]   There's a lot of value to it.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.120]   There's a lot of value for people that come to conferences.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.000]   They want content.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.760]   It's been a pretty amazing ride for a couple of years now.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.920]   Was that an intentional career path that you sat down and planned it out or it just kind
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.120]   of happened into it?
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.720]   It definitely happened into it.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.760]   There was no plan for it.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:05.440]   I, and like, frankly, I mean, just as an introvert by nature, like I did not relish getting up
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.720]   in front of large crowds.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.960]   I did not feel like, hey, I've got a great idea for a career.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.920]   Let's be like an introverted person who likes to stand in front of hundreds of people at
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.320]   a time.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:21.280]   In fact, ironically, like I was actually a theater minor in college because I was a set
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.240]   design and lighting design geek because I was terrified of being on stage.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.160]   So like I truly never, never went up in front of people, even as a theater major, never
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.000]   went up in front of people or a theater minor.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.440]   For me, like it basically evolved from a teaching education perspective.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.920]   So being more introverted, you know, what did I like doing?
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.360]   I like spending time with textbooks.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.400]   So I got started in my career and I started accumulating knowledge and education.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.960]   Basically, I started accumulating degrees and designations.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:58.800]   And so in the span of the first four or five years of my career, while working full time,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.040]   I basically just left myself continuously enrolled part time in school on doing little
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.240]   classes evenings and weekends.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.000]   But you do that for years continuously and all of a sudden, like degrees and designations
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.640]   start popping out.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.560]   So I got my certified financial platter marks.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.000]   I got a master's degree in financial planning and added a bunch more thereafter and became
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.800]   a technical expert.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.880]   So my career began to shape in the direction of I'm going to be a technical dude.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.360]   I'm going to be the knowledge dude in the firm.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.320]   And this was kind of early mid 2000s.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   So that was actually a new phenomenon emerging that there was even a career track for just
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.440]   being a good technical expert and not going out there to be a salesperson.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.560]   I didn't want to be a salesperson.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   I didn't want to be a prospecting person, meeting strangers and going out and doing
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.160]   that with kind of my whole introvert thing that was terrifying to me.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.720]   I technically started doing that in the first job.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.440]   It was horrible.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.720]   I lasted barely a year.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.400]   I was getting nothing done.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.120]   So I was going down this whole road of, all right, if I want to make it in this industry,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.440]   I've just got to be technically sharp.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.240]   I've got to be able to contribute something with my knowledge because I sure as heck can't
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.360]   contribute anything by going out there and getting business and getting clients.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   And so I got technically competent enough that eventually I started getting involved
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:25.280]   in some local study groups and at some point in like 2004 maybe, you know, someone said,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.720]   "Hey, a lot more of my clients are getting hit by the alternative minimum taxes.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.920]   Anybody know much about this?"
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.480]   I was like, "Well, actually, I've done some stuff with this.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.240]   I'm working on a master screen taxation."
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.400]   I was, I had moved on to it at that point.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.040]   So like, I'll talk about that.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.400]   So I went home, made a little like PowerPoint presentation, went in, taught my peers.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.200]   It was basically like my first public speaking event in front of, I think there were six
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.240]   other people in the room.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.040]   I mean, it's like my little study group, peer group.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.760]   But it went well and I kind of liked it.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.400]   I was like, you know, all right, in general, I'm basically terrified to be in front of
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.520]   audiences and people.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.120]   But you know, when I'm just talking about something that I really, really know well,
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.360]   like it just, it wasn't a big deal.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:07.760]   I'm fine.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.480]   Like as long as I, as long as it's something I've got technical mastery on, not a big deal.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.280]   I actually was sort of surprised to find I felt quite comfortable.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.520]   So I'm like, I'm going to try this a little bit more.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.080]   So I did it for my local study group and then like I did it for a local chapter meeting.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.360]   So then there were 30 or 40 people in the room and it turned out a lot of them thought
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.040]   I did a pretty good job because I clearly knew my stuff technically.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.720]   I kind of liked explaining things.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.200]   And so it just grew from there.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.760]   So I did that and then someone referred me to another chapter and then I did a few chapters
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.560]   and then I actually managed to slip into a breakout session on a national conference.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.920]   You know, they did a call for speakers.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.240]   I'm like, I got this technical session on AMT and Lord knows nobody else wanted to talk
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.600]   about something that esoteric.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.200]   So they were like, oh my gosh, there's one person actually put their name in for this
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.520]   topic.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.320]   We should grab them.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.600]   The one guy who actually cares about AMT planning.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.080]   Yes.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.320]   So like, and like, and that became sort of my first little niche within a niche topic
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:04.560]   area.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.880]   I started doing all these sessions on the alternative minimum tax.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.280]   And so, you know, I did like a handful of these and then the next year, you know, a
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.400]   few people suggest me to some other people and I did a few more.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:23.040]   And then like by the third year I got a couple more requests and, and, you know, basically
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.640]   all of these were just like, yes, if you fly me to your, you know, wherever it is, then
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.840]   I'll show up and speak.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.880]   And so then like, I think it was literally not until about the third year of this and
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.360]   I'd probably done 15 or 20 or something over the span of, of two and a half years.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.440]   And I was like, you know what, if I really like want to make this into something, I should
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.880]   charge money for it.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.160]   And it was terrifying.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.640]   Like the first time I did it, like my voice was catching.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.360]   It was like, and you know, I also charge a hundred dollars to be on site for the, for
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.840]   the event.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.640]   I remember like the first one I did, it was like, I said, it's my travel expenses plus
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.520]   a hundred bucks.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.400]   And like, they, they didn't even think twice about it.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.600]   Probably not the least of which I wasn't even thinking about like the hotel room they have
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.680]   to put me in probably cost more than a hundred bucks.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.360]   Like they're, they're going to drop three to $500 on a plane ticket just to get me there.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.200]   It's like the last hundred bucks is nothing.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.700]   Right.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.560]   But like, I was so terrified to ask and, but I did.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.360]   And so I charged a hundred bucks and then like people kept asking me, like, I'm going
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.920]   to ask 250 and see if they still say yes.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.840]   And they did.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.920]   And I'm like, it's still like, I wasn't even thinking about it.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.160]   I'm like, cause you haven't even gotten your plane ticket yet.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.400]   Like the small dollars compared to what they were already budgeting just for me to travel
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.360]   to get there.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.480]   But they kept saying yes.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.280]   And, and so like this entire speaking career that I built has really been nothing more
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.240]   than, um, you know, find something I can learn about and be really expert about, share it
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.800]   with my, uh, share it with my peers.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.360]   I know my peers cause I know my audience cause they are my peers.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.800]   So I just, that's all I talked to.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.240]   I talked to financial advisors cause I'm a financial advisor and I know what they're
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.680]   thinking cause it's what I'm thinking.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:07.280]   Uh, and the more that requests came in every time a whole bunch of questions came in, I'm
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   like, well, apparently people still like what I'm doing.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.840]   So I'm going to ask for a little bit more and you know, eight, 10 years later worth
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.480]   of doing it now it's like, like, holy crap.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.680]   I actually, like I can really live off of just being a speaker.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.320]   Right.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.280]   And you know, and, and take care of my family and do good things.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.040]   And then there's like even time left on the side to be involved in other businesses as
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.360]   well.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   And, and all this other stuff that's, uh, that's grown from it.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.520]   But like all of it, um, basically tracks back to like showing at a, showing up at a
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.760]   conference and being in, so really two things, showing up at a conference and being involved
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.120]   and joining a professional membership association.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.600]   Cause that was how I actually found the study group and the first chapter meeting and the
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.800]   things that kicked off the, uh, the speaking on that end.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:17:00.480]   And, and again, like I give full credit to my, uh, to my firm and the, and the, and the
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:06.640]   partners there while I'm a partner now, but I, I came in as a staff member then, uh, you
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.560]   know, they sent me to the first conference.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.880]   They put me in the membership association, sent me off for the first chapter meeting.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.400]   Like I was just not aware, not cognizant, nothing on my radar screen of like how meaningful
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.440]   it is to be engaged with the community.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.080]   Right.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.040]   Of, you know, what you do or what you're involved with, what your career is, what your
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.840]   vocation is.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.600]   And it like, it's just so powerful.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.280]   Uh, I was clueless.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.360]   Like I just, I just had no idea until they said you're doing it and they wrote the check
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.640]   and I just had to show up, which they basically told me I had to show up.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.560]   And then I started doing things like, oh, okay.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.080]   Like this is kind of cool.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.760]   I'm making connections to people.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.760]   Okay.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.960]   I'm like, I'm starting to like this.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.320]   And today I would guess, I mean, you're certainly one of the, you are one of the
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.680]   leaders of the industry.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.440]   You are one of the more well-connected and influential leaders of the industry.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.320]   And it happened because of exposure, education, consistency, marketing.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.200]   I mean, you don't hurt for business opportunities, right?
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.760]   No, no.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.440]   And, uh, I mean, like I, so I forget who it is.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.600]   Whoever had the famous quote of like, you know, the, the overwhelming majority of success
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.040]   is just bothering to show up.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.880]   Like, yeah, a whole, whole lot of my success, like it's because I showed up and I kept
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.080]   showing up places and I showed up places and I met people and I talked to people and if
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.920]   I could be helpful, I was helpful to them.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.560]   And then at some point down the road, karma came back.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.520]   And if you're show up enough and help enough people, like there's a lot of karmic balance
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.960]   that seems to build in your favor.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.200]   And like, not that I'm like literally spiritual in this direction, but, but like, just there,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.240]   there really is an effect.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.760]   And it's actually well studied in the world of, um, of, of influence and persuasion that,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.960]   you know, just like as human beings, part of how we're hardwired around, you know, basically
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.520]   being able to like exist and function in the herd.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.280]   So our, our, our brains just are kind of hardwired around, um, these effects of reciprocity.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.400]   Someone does something good for us.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.000]   We want to do something in return.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.120]   Like we, we feel like we have this ingrained debt to them that must be righted in the cosmic
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.920]   world.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.240]   Um, and, and now I'm like, I'm going to sell Machiavellian to say this, but, but like, so
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.520]   what that means is if you just try to go out there and try to be as helpful to as many
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.480]   people as possible, you end up with this giant number of people that all feel that they owe
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.680]   a debt for you and just want to help you in any way that they can in return.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.800]   And if you, you know, seed that much goodwill out there, a lot of good things just start
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.520]   coming back to you.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.040]   And I, I like definitely feel like a huge portion of how I've been able to grow and
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.320]   succeed in building, uh, businesses and a career is, is, is just driven off of that.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.600]   The number of people that I have just helped for no reason than they contact me and asked
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.800]   a question and I felt like I had something that I could contribute to them.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.440]   And then years later, you know, something good happens.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.800]   So I, you know, worked with someone, helped them out early in their career.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.080]   They had a great thing going, you know, give them a little nudge along the way.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.920]   And then like, Oh, five years later, they're in charge of an entire national conference
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.480]   team.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:06.880]   Right.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.680]   And they're like, Hey, I remember you helped me that time.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.880]   Well, you know, we need a keynote speaker now and I've always remembered you.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.200]   I'm like, okay, so I spent like 10 minutes on the phone once for you helping out a business
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.080]   problem and you're going to give me a national conference keynote session with a five year
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.360]   delay lag on it.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.600]   So like just those sorts of things and like, yeah, a whole bunch of stuff that I do never
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.440]   comes back and you know, nothing ever happens, but just you, you, you seed the world with
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.000]   a lot of goodwill and goodwill just starts to come back.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.160]   I've been on exactly the other opposite side of that.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.360]   And you know, I've sent you a couple of desperate emails when I didn't know who to ask and I
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.960]   just said, I got to talk to somebody.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.600]   And we've had some phone calls at points of desperation and you just took a few minutes
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.040]   and it was incredibly helpful.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.080]   And it certainly does.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.200]   I have, I owe you a debt of gratitude for that.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.040]   And you never know where the future goes.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.160]   And it's true.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.960]   And again, like I mean, I feel like I've, maybe I'm self-conscious about it.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.160]   Like I feel like I've made this Machiavellian thing of like, you go out there and get as
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.600]   many people indebted to you as possible, and then you can call in all of your debts and
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.100]   be rich.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.880]   Like, it's nothing like that.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.720]   And I'm, I'm not that well coordinated.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:20.880]   But like, it's just recognizing that that reality of, of you know, there's both sort
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.360]   of a, just, it's nice to do good in the world and pay it forward and things like that.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.680]   But just recognize like there really is sort of a human psychology around it that when,
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.080]   when, when you help people, they want to help you.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.800]   And that does, that can do some very good things for you in the long run.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.360]   When did you start writing and publishing your writing?
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.480]   At what stage in your career?
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:47.840]   So it was a little bit late, it was a little bit later than all of the, the conference
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.880]   and speaking stuff went underway.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:55.440]   So I showed up on my first conference and speaking gig about four years into my career.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.480]   Probably started doing a little bit of writing about five to six years into my career.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.520]   So I'll admit, like, I always had a little bit of a writing bent.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.360]   I, you know, I, I graduated from college 15 years ago, 2000.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   So like right, right at the market peak and, and the high end of the tech bubble and sort
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.760]   of, you know, upward rise of, of the internet.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.480]   And so I'd gotten very active on like, message forums and, and writing and forums and just
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.360]   engaging there.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.640]   And, you know, lucky me, I, two parents who were computer scientists.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.320]   So I learned to type very young, like, you know, maybe speak and teach us typing, right?
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.160]   My 10 finger typing skill.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.320]   So I type very, very quickly, which, which makes it easier to do a lot of writing.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.120]   So like, I, I suppose in retrospect, like I was already exercising a little bit of my
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.040]   writing skill, learning it as a skill, just on things like message forums, you know, getting
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.880]   involved with like, you know, there was a message forum back then called financialplanning.com.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.920]   The site's actually still there.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.680]   It's a magazine, but the message forums aren't as active as they used to be.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.160]   But yes, I start showing up there and like answering people's questions and just, you
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.240]   know, typing, interacting with people, but, you know, doing it in reasonable prose and
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.920]   typing and writing style.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:16.240]   And the first article I ever did was actually an article called the other side of financial
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.740]   planning.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.040]   And it was a discussion of how I was kind of going down this new career track that not
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   very many people were doing at the time where I wanted to basically be a technical geek
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.960]   working in a firm and not just going out there and getting clients, which was sort of the
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.720]   industry standard of what everybody did.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:43.200]   And so the editor of one of the trade publications heard about my story through the association,
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.560]   found me online through my writing in the message forums, saw that like I actually could
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.800]   write in complete sentences with proper punctuation and grammar and such, and got in touch with
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.920]   me and said, like, I've heard you have an interesting story.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.480]   It looks like you can actually write.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.600]   Would you be interested in basically writing an article just about your story, your experience,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.840]   the path you've been on, what you've done?
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.120]   And I was like, oh, cool.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.640]   Like a magazine wants me to write an article about like the things I've been doing.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.360]   Okay, cool.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.200]   We'll try it out.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.960]   And so that became the first article that I wrote.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.280]   And I liked it.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.040]   Like it was neat.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.160]   I sort of enjoyed writing.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.520]   I felt like I had something to share.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.640]   I got a couple of emails in response.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.160]   People were like, that was a neat story.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.360]   I was like, all right, this is kind of cool.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.680]   You write something, you get it out there and people respond to you.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.440]   And like I kind of like this engagement.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.240]   And so it just started building from there.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.680]   So then I now had a relationship with an editor.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.520]   So I would contact him from time to time like, hey, I'm working on something about this.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.080]   Would you be interested in an article on it?
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.520]   And because I was sort of blending this with my presentation, so I was doing lots of like
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.040]   technical geeky style things.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.560]   Not a lot of other people actually like to do fairly technical writing.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.160]   So the editor virtually always said yes.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.960]   So I suddenly had this like contout to publish.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.320]   So I started publishing there.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.280]   Then I started sending things to a couple of other places.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.600]   And after about three or four years of that, I was actually getting so into writing that
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.720]   I was getting frustrated because now suddenly I felt like I had so much to say and so many
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.840]   things to say and share.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:24.240]   I kept smacking into column length limitations in trade publications.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.320]   You know, the standard columns would be like 1,500 words, even like a journal article would
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.600]   be 5,000 words.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.520]   And like if I did some really in-depth research thing, I'm like, if it takes me longer than
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.280]   that to write it, I want the room to write it.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:35.860]   Right.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:42.720]   And so I got so frustrated with content length limits of basically physical print magazines
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   because that's how most of this was distributed then.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.080]   I decided I would just make my own electronic newsletter.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.520]   And then if I wanted to write some insane like 20-page treatise on something, I could
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:53.840]   write it.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.680]   And if there were a couple other human beings out there who liked some insane 20-page treatise,
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.040]   they could pay me a couple of bucks for it.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.200]   And that would be cool.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:08.720]   And so I launched a newsletter service that I'm still running seven years later in early
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.440]   2008.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.480]   Where basically it said, hey, if you're like one of the one or two percent of advisors
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.960]   that just really likes actual deep technical stuff, like you're tired of the fluff and
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.040]   you want something deep, I'm your guy.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.160]   I'm actually going to write that.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.440]   And a couple of people started showing up and they actually wanted to pay me to write
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:29.600]   it.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:37.040]   So I started getting subscribers and that began this sort of writing business.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.320]   Now the way that end evolved.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.560]   So I started writing this newsletter on basically really dense technical topics.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.000]   They were eligible for continuing education credits for financial planners.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.480]   Now our CFP board organization that oversees the continuing education only allows you to
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.520]   get continuing education credit for like actual technical topics.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.960]   So if you want to write about the business of practice planning, that's off limits.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.040]   You have to actually write about like the subject matter expertise areas, taxes, retirement
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.640]   insurance, system planning, things like that.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.760]   But I sort of felt like I had a couple of things to say from time to time about the
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.200]   business of financial planning as well as I was getting more immersed in that side of
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.000]   things.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.120]   So I decided like, hey, I'm going to make a blog and try this out.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.160]   Like I've heard of blogs.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.200]   Other people do blogs.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.760]   Like our industry had no blogs, like nothing.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.440]   It's like, I'm going to try this out.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.920]   And so I sort of had this vision in my head, like the newsletter would be the technical
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.440]   topics and then I would use the blog to sort of voice my own like practice management industry
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.520]   comments of just stuff that I wanted to put out there, right?
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.400]   Because that's what you do on a blog.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.000]   You just sort of like say things that are on your mind.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.200]   So hey, let's try this out.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.680]   So I launched that sort of in tandem with the newsletter in 2008.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.200]   So the newsletter got some really good early traction.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.120]   I was lucky in part I got some really nice support from a guy who'd actually been writing
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.880]   a newsletter business in the industry for many, many years named Bob Veras.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.400]   Writes a very well-known practice management newsletter in the industry.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.720]   And he was really supportive of telling me like, you should go do this.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.600]   And he said, you know what, if you do it, I'll send a thing out to my, you know, I've
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.160]   seen your writing.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.000]   I know you do good stuff for advisors who want it.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.560]   I will send something out to my subscribers, my mailing list that just says, hey, folks,
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.000]   if you like this, you should check it out.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.680]   And so he did.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.000]   I got like a really nice initial subscriber bump basically at launch from his support.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.920]   So, you know, so that got started.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.680]   So the newsletter was off to a great start.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.440]   And then I was doing the blogging thing on the side and the blogging was basically going
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:45.940]   nowhere.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.800]   Like I wasn't getting comments.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.760]   I didn't really feel like I was getting any interaction of feedback.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.120]   So I'm like, I should install Google Analytics and like figure out what's going on.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.040]   So I went and installed Google Analytics.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.920]   And now I had like definitive proof that basically no one was coming to read my blog.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.000]   So like it wasn't just that it felt like I was releasing content to an echo chamber.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.920]   I pretty much had proof that no one was coming to read my blog.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.880]   So I actually shut it down.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.600]   Like I let it go completely after, you know, six to nine months and basically stopped posting.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.200]   I would do like one article every three months because something struck me and I wanted to rant.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.320]   But I basically stopped.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   And I stopped for almost two years until like the middle of 2010 and watching what frankly
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.440]   was not new at all, but like the rise of social media.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.880]   So really, really watching.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.120]   So at that point, LinkedIn was gaining momentum.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.640]   Facebook was really gaining momentum.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.080]   This Twitter thing had been around for a year or two and was starting to happen more.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.200]   And so, you know, another friend of the industry, another person I met through conferences and
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.120]   associations and all the rest named Bill Winterberg.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.880]   So he does technology consulting for advisors in the industry.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.000]   Said, you know, Mike, you got to look at this Twitter thing.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   Like I think you'd really like it.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.080]   You'd really be into it.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.960]   I'm like, all right, what the hell?
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.560]   I'll try out Twitter.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.840]   So I joined Twitter and I just started watching a little of what's going on on Twitter and was
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:13.360]   like, oh, I kind of see like people do a little chit chat and discussion, but then also just like
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.920]   they read things and they share them out there.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:22.800]   And I had one of those like eureka moments, light bulb goes off above head, sorts of things.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.760]   I was like, okay, wait, I get it now.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:31.360]   You create the content on your site and then you can share and distribute it out through
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.120]   social media and other people will share it on social media and then it gets shared and
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.600]   gets out there.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.360]   So like my mystery had always been, right, I know how to create content.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.720]   Like I've been writing and speaking and doing this stuff for a while now and getting practiced
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.040]   at it.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.640]   But I have no idea how you get it out there.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.200]   And so watching social media taking off, it's like, oh, I get it.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.000]   You write it, you share it on social media, but other people share it on social media
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.120]   and then it begins to grow.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.480]   And so I kind of re-immersed back in the blog and did that and like, damn, it just started
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.440]   working.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.920]   And like now the Google Analytics said actually people are showing up and every month more
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.000]   people show up than the people in the prior month and off it went.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.480]   And so now four or five years later doing that, it's like basically, I guess, four and
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.920]   a half years or so since I sort of reinvested into that launch.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:25.040]   All of a sudden now I have, I guess, basically the leading blog site around the industry.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.080]   I've kind of come into my own little niche here and just the amount of business opportunities
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.240]   and things that have spawned off of that are like just blow me away.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.280]   Just all the opportunities and things that come in by just making a presence for yourself
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.360]   and getting it out there and letting people find their way to you.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.440]   How much time do you spend reading every week and in the past how much?
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.680]   And that can be technical reading or just personal reading?
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.700]   Oh, man.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:59.760]   I spend a good amount of time reading every week, many, many hours worth between just
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.280]   industry and trade publications and like really keeping up on the beat of everything that's
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.760]   happening in our world.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.120]   Somewhere around book reading as well, I've actually been trying to pair my articles,
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.440]   websites, blogs, trade publication reading down a tiny bit and dial up just the book
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.480]   reading a little bit more because if you're going to search the web for content, you pretty
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.000]   much never reach the bottom of that web.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.500]   Absolutely.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.360]   So that becomes tough.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.640]   But I mean hours a week.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.840]   In fact, I got to the point where I realized I spent so many hours every week reading all
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.480]   these articles and stuff and there's a bunch of junky stuff and then every now and then
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.600]   it's like, "Wow, this article had a great idea or a great insight."
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.040]   Then one of the things I ended up launching on the blog was like, "I'm just going to
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.520]   make the summary of the half dozen or a dozen best articles I read that week, write a little
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.680]   summary of them and send them out to my readers."
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.000]   And that's actually become one of my most popular anchor posts to the blog.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.720]   Every Friday I post weekend reading for financial planners.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.120]   Here's the dozen best articles about our world of financial planning that I read this
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   week.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.240]   And just leveraging like, "Hey, I do all this reading already.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.360]   I can be an effective filter for other people who have even less time than I do to read."
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.760]   But yeah, if you're not in a continuous learning mode, change passes you by pretty
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.240]   quickly.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.520]   So I've led you into a trap here.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:30.240]   Have you ever heard Brian Tracy's little speech on the 1000% formula of increasing
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.160]   your income by 1000% over 10 years?
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.280]   I don't think I have.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.240]   So in summary, what he says is that you can increase your income by 1000% every 10 years
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.600]   by increasing your effectiveness and skill by one tenth of one percent each day.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.760]   So you make a tiny incremental improvement each day and it compounds over the course
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   of 10 years to be about 1000%.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.000]   Because you're 10 times more effective, then now you're going to have an increase in your
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.720]   income of probably around 10 times.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.520]   And he gives a number of steps to it that were super helpful to me.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.440]   It changed my life when I heard it as a teenager.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.920]   Step one was reading every day, 30 to 60 minutes.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.200]   You read about 50 books a year.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   You read 500 books in your field over 10 years.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.720]   You're a world-class expert.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.440]   Step two was going to at least four conferences a year.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.200]   By going to conferences, you become a world-class expert because you hear what's going on at
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.000]   those conferences.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.920]   Step three, and he had other steps, I've added to that writing and disseminating information,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.240]   learning to speak and speaking at conferences and just basically building your knowledge
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.200]   and your impact.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.600]   And over time, that happens.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.360]   So I've tried to do it intentionally, although it fits and starts.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.040]   But I'm curious, would you guess if you look back 10 or so years ago, would you guess that
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.840]   your income is a higher multiple than what it was 10 or so years ago?
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:47.760]   Actually, if I really try to project back and do the math of about where I was, that
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:56.480]   10x multiple is actually probably really close to dead on of how much income in businesses
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.440]   has grown for me.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.680]   And that's particularly stunning for me.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.280]   Again, my career track of what had taken me up to that point almost exactly 10 years ago
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.400]   was I basically had done a very purposeful effort of making sure that I was never actually
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.120]   in a position where I had to prospect, find business or sell anything because I was terrified
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.840]   of prospecting.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.560]   You and me both.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:23.600]   And so now, when I look at it, it was sort of like wearing my business hat, a huge portion
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.840]   of what I do to make income is basically come down to creating businesses where I see need
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.040]   in our industry, which I see a lot of because, as you said, I read a huge amount of stuff
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.320]   and I go to a zillion conferences.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.240]   So I see need and opportunity all over the place.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:45.200]   And then using my platform to help drive business to those businesses of just people that read
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.880]   my stuff because it's helpful, I hope.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.440]   And hey, if you think this is helpful, I have some other businesses that can help you solve
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.160]   other problems.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.000]   And I just hope you'll check them out.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.520]   And large numbers become amazing things.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.600]   Like I need one hundredth of one percent of all the people who come to my site to do business
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.400]   with me every month.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.800]   And I'm making more money than I ever dreamed of.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.120]   So yeah, I would definitely fully validate that.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:20.080]   And particularly, those underpinnings of reading actively, going out to conferences, I'd probably
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:26.640]   blend that a little bit to say going out to conferences and or being involved in a membership
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.120]   association, like whatever the group is for your industry.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.160]   For me, it was very much a blend of both that created some of the meaningful impact.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:43.120]   But yeah, that's what drives to craft expertise in your industry, in your space, in your niche,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.240]   in whatever it is that you do.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:53.200]   And because so few people do that, it's kind of amazing, sort of like the rarefied error
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.320]   that you can move up to just by persistently trying to read and take in information and
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.760]   then share it back out to people.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.400]   And it feels so slow in the beginning, but over time it gains momentum and it gains momentum.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.640]   And my guess is I would we'll see it.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.760]   We'll check back in 10 years, but there's no reason why it can't increase by another
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.040]   10x in the next 10 years.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:21.760]   Yeah, I was very lucky coming into it that I got to do a lot of that building process
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:28.320]   from a stable base, which was having an ongoing job at an advisory firm.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.200]   So I guess the blend, having a stable base, being a little bit of a workaholic.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.960]   So I put in my time at the firm.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.400]   I put in more than my time at the firm.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.400]   I was the first one in and the last one to leave most days.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.360]   And then I went home and read and studied and analyzed and educated myself,
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   got my degrees and designations and such.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:58.400]   But what that meant, the fact that I was doing my work and my time on top of that meant when
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:05.120]   the time came for things like going to my firm and saying, "Hey, I got an invitation
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.400]   for this speaking engagement."
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.840]   We were doing financial planning for consumers.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.520]   I was going to speak at an industry event.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   So no one was under any illusions that I was going to go to this event and bring clients
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.160]   home.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.240]   This was not business development for the firm.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.840]   The firm was not making money off the fact that I was going to go vanish and go to a
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.040]   speaking engagement.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.840]   They're like, "You know what?
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.000]   You work your ass off around here.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.400]   We can't even make you take all your vacation days.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.840]   It probably would be healthy for you if you would just not come into the office for a
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.720]   day or two.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.440]   So go for it.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.240]   Knock yourself out."
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.880]   So the firm was very supportive of me letting me go out and starting to do my speaking and
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.680]   my other stuff because I was putting in my time.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.600]   I was putting my dues with the firm as well.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.640]   So I created the opportunity for myself to have the flexibility.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.120]   And then the flexibility gave me what at the end of the day was like, I mean, it was a
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.400]   really slow build.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.040]   It was probably two years before I've ever charged anything.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.160]   And even when I started charging things, I was charging $100 and $250 for what was basically
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.320]   a day and a half of travel.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.120]   You're not going to build a giant career off of $100 a day and eight hours of travel.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:18.560]   But having that base of both job and frankly salary and doing all of this in addition to
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:24.480]   it for a period of time, it gave me the base that I could ease into this slowly and take
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.920]   the time that it takes to really build an expertise, a niche, a presence, all those
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.800]   words that we throw around, which I can vouch really actually have impact after a while.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.440]   Right.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.960]   But it is.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.080]   It's a slow building process.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.640]   It takes a while to get there.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.680]   And I was fortunate that I had a way to kind of bridge that gap from when you're trying
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.360]   to get started from scratch, from nothing until you get to that point where it's at
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.200]   least a livable wage, a livable dollar amount for me.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:01.440]   And I guess basically if I look back at that, the livable gap for me was three and a half
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:10.080]   years or so from when I first did the first conference speaking engagement, which was
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.640]   free, but the first conference speaking engagement, the first article until I was like, "I've
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.720]   got this newsletter service and I've got this speaking thing.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.080]   And if I actually mix all that together, I could live off of this money."
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:20.880]   Right.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.240]   I could, like, I don't even have to do the full-time job anymore.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.160]   I could go change things.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:26.800]   And I did.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.240]   And that was what kind of started down the next freeing path.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.640]   But it was three and a half years.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.360]   And actually having launched several different niche businesses in our industry now, I've
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:44.400]   been fascinated by this phenomenon that almost all of them find an inflection point in the
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.120]   third year.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:45.600]   Wow.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.800]   Like just the first year you work your ass off.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.600]   We're not on television, right?
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.320]   I can say ass.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:58.480]   You work your ass off for the first year for basically like nothing.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.680]   Like nothing's coming in.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.280]   You're just building, like you're making connections.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.160]   You're meeting people.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.040]   They don't know who the hell you are, what you do, why they would trust you, anything.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   Then you do it the second year.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.320]   So like year one, you get like this tiny handful of clients or engagements or events or
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.440]   serve people who buy your service, whatever it is that you're offering.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:24.160]   And then year two basically feels not very different from year one.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.000]   Like you're continuing to grind.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.400]   A slightly smaller handful of people come in because now you get a few people who buy
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.080]   your service and a few people who kind of kicked your tire last year but didn't really
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.720]   do anything.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.400]   Like, well, you're still around.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.200]   It's been another year.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.640]   I guess maybe you're legit now.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:38.880]   All right.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.320]   Well, like we'll try something.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.360]   And then all of a sudden year three, like this transition moment, it's like year one,
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.640]   they just get to know you.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.200]   Year two, they begin to like you.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.600]   Year three, they actually trust you.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.960]   And when you get through no like and trust and the trust part picks up, all of a sudden
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.800]   business just starts flowing in.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.280]   And so it'd be like year one, you're doing all this grinding.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.000]   Year two, you're doing all this grinding and getting maybe a little bit of spillover
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.120]   effect from year one.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.960]   And then suddenly year three, it's like all these people who've been talking to for two
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.880]   years show up, a whole bunch of new people you see have actually heard of you and are
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.840]   like, "Oh, yeah, you're legit.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.400]   I've heard of you.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.800]   You've been around for a couple of years and they want to do business with you very
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.680]   quickly."
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.520]   And then all of those people in that pipeline start referring you because now like you're
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.520]   the guy or the girl, you're the go-to person.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.880]   You've been doing this for years.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.760]   People know who you are.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.680]   And they start referring business in and it just starts exponentially jumping.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.080]   And so, you know, like people think of building businesses of like, you know, my growth patterns
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.360]   can be one, two, three, four.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.400]   Like I keep building one layer every year and I find like just one niche business after
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:44.900]   another.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.920]   They almost all follow what's basically a one, two, five, ten pattern.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.360]   - Interesting.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.520]   - So, you know, year one, you just do X.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.440]   Year two, you basically just do 2X, much of which is last year's X plus just a little
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.560]   bit that you add on.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.120]   But then suddenly in year three, you don't just go one, two, three.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.320]   You go like one, two, five.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.040]   - Right.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.400]   - And then all of a sudden the five doubles to ten because now the thing's getting momentum.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.600]   And then now it's just a question of how big is this thing going to start growing and where
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.520]   is it going to land and can you execute on that well?
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   - It's fascinating because when I started as a financial advisor, it was exactly that.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.440]   I did not have fun until my third year.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.320]   And then after my third year, it was like something changed.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.920]   And all of a sudden it was people actually said, "Oh, Josh was going to do this for a
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.160]   while.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.080]   He might actually know what he's talking about."
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.920]   And the fourth year was a radically different experience than the second year.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.160]   And now with new business, with radical personal finance, I'm grinding it out for year one.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.440]   But we'll see.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.400]   I'll report back.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:47.360]   - And I think it's just, I mean, having been through so many of these now, even having
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.760]   been through them and knowing what the pattern is, it still feels kind of despairing sometimes
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.440]   in year one for how slow it's growing.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.720]   And it still feels despairing in year two for like, "God, I've been working like a year
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.360]   and a half."
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.680]   You're halfway through year two of trying to do something like this.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.840]   Like a year and a half, like I've been working really hard a really long time and I really
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.920]   don't feel like there's a lot of momentum yet.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.440]   Like this kind of sucks.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:13.920]   - Right.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:20.240]   - Like it's really a grind just like mentally to get yourself into year three.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.720]   - Right.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.160]   - But you get there and stuff starts showing up.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.120]   And now like having a bunch of these that I've been doing even more years, like, and
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.400]   that like the exponential growth rate doesn't stop after year four either.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.520]   Like I can say, having been on the other end of a bunch of these like, and the damn thing
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.400]   just keeps going.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:36.880]   - It's awesome.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.320]   - And you get to your like Brian Tracy thousand percent numbers.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:40.400]   - Right.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.080]   - It's amazing.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.600]   You know, all those, basically it's compounding effects, right?
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   - Right.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.800]   - It's like, you know, finance world, we love to talk about compound interest, but like
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.400]   the compounding effects happen in most businesses of that nature.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.640]   - And the thing I think we should teach people, so we always use the example to teach compound
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.840]   interest of the magic penny.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.480]   And that's nice.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.120]   You do it for 31 days, the double penny is 10 million bucks.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:01.120]   - Yeah.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.160]   - It's a massive number.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.320]   But what I started teaching clients, I said, go back and look when you're five days in
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.640]   and when you're 10 days in and this magic penny, you have a grand total of 72 cents.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:10.960]   - Yeah.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.280]   - And as most people, they quit or they spend the money or they quit or they spend the money.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:21.040]   And the point is go back and look at how slow it is for the first 15, 20, 25 days.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.080]   It's in those last five days that in that example where it makes up the difference.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.120]   And that's what you're expressing.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.560]   - Yeah, I like that.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.920]   That's actually a really good analogy of a way to frame it up.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.880]   Like it's so true.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.840]   I mean, the challenge of trying to sort of compound your growth, getting something started
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.320]   for yourself.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.520]   I mean, whatever it is, it's your career trajectory.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.560]   It's building a business.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.880]   It's building some brand platform, writing, blogging, speaking, podcast, like whatever
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.160]   it is, whatever your endeavor is.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:53.040]   It gets so true that I'm a math geek.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.720]   So like I always have to think of it in math terms.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.000]   But like when you start compounding growth rates on a really small number.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:58.320]   - Right.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.880]   - The growth of a really small number is still a really small number.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.120]   - Yeah.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.400]   - And it takes a while before the compounding gets to the point where it starts adding up
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.680]   to material dollars.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:12.240]   But the back end of compounding growth is just extraordinary growth numbers that come on
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.200]   extraordinary growth numbers.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:13.760]   Like, holy crap.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.080]   - It's amazing.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.520]   - Where did all this come from?
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.040]   How did all this happen?
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:22.640]   And like truly, I mean, there's the old saying of like, what got you here won't get you there,
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.200]   which won't move you forward from here.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.680]   Which I've certainly like found, lived, experienced.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:35.360]   Like truly, and I really don't mean this in some like self-aggrandizing manner at all,
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.680]   but like my greatest challenge right now that I've really been struggling with over the
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.920]   past year and I'm considering to struggle with this year.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.680]   Now my problem is that the growth has created so much opportunity.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.200]   It's very difficult to choose amongst the opportunities.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.480]   And like it just, it leads me to struggle with all sorts of decisions that I never thought
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:03.760]   about before of like, I have to care more about how I spend my time because otherwise,
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.000]   like there are literally a never ending stream of emails of people who contact me, of people
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.880]   who want help.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.120]   And like, it feels bad in many ways.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.720]   Like I have to carve up like who I'm going to help and who I'm not.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.920]   But like, I can just only help so many people.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.080]   And you know, it's led me in the direction now of like trying to create more in different
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:28.800]   businesses because I'm so at a personal capacity constraint that I need to create things where
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.880]   I can shepherd people to a place where they can get the help because I can't do the help.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.400]   And I'm even already hitting the next level of it, which is, and I can only manage so
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.240]   many businesses doing this.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.360]   So I need business partners.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.120]   I need other people that can drive these businesses so that I can make sure people get to a place
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.440]   where they get helped and then basically get the hell out of the way.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.720]   And like having been a very hands-on person around all the work that I've done for years,
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.040]   I, you know, to accept over the past year that in virtually everything that we do for
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.880]   all of our different clients and businesses now, I am the bottleneck in all processes.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.120]   I am the one that...
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.840]   And the problem is you know that, you know, you're supposed to get yourself out.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.960]   It's so challenging.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.760]   It is so challenging.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.520]   So like, I'm, you know, I'm learning the skill of getting the hell out of my own way now.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   But like, particularly, I've been someone that's, that was so hands-on everything.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.480]   I mean, I'm not very much like roll up my sleeves and dive into my things.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.760]   That's how I build all these businesses and kind of this platform for myself that,
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.320]   you know, just being ready to get out of my own way when it used to like, I mean, literally,
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.080]   like I go back years ago, like I made a lot of the early point steps in my career because
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.840]   I was the guy that got this stuff done.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.200]   Whenever, when other people would let things fall through the cracks, I was the get stuff done guy.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.920]   And now I'm the one that hinders the get stuff done guy.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:51.360]   So like, just even having that whole realization like, oh, now I understand why a lot of our
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.200]   partners would dump the things on me the way that they did and why all these problems would
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.320]   crop up the way that they did.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   Now I'm on the other side of that, that like productivity line of what it's like building
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.480]   businesses and like, okay, I'm understanding now why things flow down the way that they
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.920]   do because when businesses really start gaining momentum for growth, like just the sheer like
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.400]   capacity limits you hit on your own personal bandwidth and what you can do, like become
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.160]   very, very noticeable very quickly.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.200]   So are you addressing that?
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.720]   Are you changing your learning and shifting from focusing on technical financial planning
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.320]   to learning some new management skills?
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.000]   Or how are you addressing that problem?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.080]   Yeah, so it's shifting a few ways.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.400]   I'm trying to be a little bit more selective about my time.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.880]   And I know, I mean, I've always viewed it this way to some extent, like really starting
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.760]   to view my time as a resource that is a precious thing to allocate that I really have to
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.800]   sometimes make hard decisions about allocating.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:51.920]   It's certainly been a driver of reinvesting into my businesses as businesses into people.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:59.040]   So I've been hiring much more of a support and infrastructure around myself of, I started
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   with a virtual assistant, I started like 10 hours a month or something a few years ago.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.600]   And then I started figuring out how to delegate stuff to her.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.000]   And I was like, all right, well, this is kind of working.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   I'm going to try you five hours a week.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.160]   And I was just so used to being hands on everything.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.720]   Like, what the heck would I give someone else to do for five hours a week?
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.680]   I do everything myself.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:24.080]   It's got to be right done my way to be done right.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:28.880]   And frankly, I think the breakthrough even for me on that end is you start viewing time
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.000]   as this precious resource, you just start converting like the value of your time into
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:34.880]   some dollar amounts.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:39.920]   Like if I want to grow myself and my business and do like a Brian Tracy 1000% thing, if
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:46.240]   that's your goal, so the rough math, divide what you make in a year by 2000, that's roughly
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.280]   your hourly rate of what you do for the year.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:54.000]   So 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year of working, you're at about 2000 hours.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.520]   So you take what you make for the year divided by 2000, you've got some estimate around your
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:57.920]   rate.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.200]   So I went through a process of doing that about a year and a half ago.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:07.680]   And then basically said, okay, look, anything, I can hire people for a lower number than
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:12.000]   this because my time, you know, value of my time was elevating as the business was going
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.240]   up.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:20.240]   So hire someone at a lower rate, anything I can find that that person can do, I instantly
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.920]   make more money in my business by letting it go and letting the other person do it so
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.080]   that I can spend my time on higher value tasks.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.320]   And kind of the secondary breakthrough that came through to me mentally is, you know what,
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:35.680]   as you grow your career and your time and your business enough, you get to the point
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.560]   where like, you know what, even if they don't do it as well as you, I'm like, I'm making
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.920]   air quotes as though, okay, I mean, when I said not doing as well, for those of you who
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.840]   are listening, I'm making air quotes right now.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.600]   So like, for those of you who don't do as well as you can, because you know, only you
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.840]   can do everything that you need done perfectly right.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:58.160]   You know, even if they, someone else has to do it and it takes them twice as long, there's
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.160]   actually enough gap in how you value your time.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.320]   That's okay.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.880]   And that was sort of the let go moment for me was I had this realization like, you know
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:11.200]   what, if I give this prototype to someone else and it takes them twice as long to do
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.240]   it as it would have taken me to just do it myself, I'm actually still more successful
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:16.880]   with that.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.680]   And you know what, eventually they do enough times that they learn how to do it, right?
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.480]   Like we, I think it's certainly me, like I get stuck and like the first time they do
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.920]   this, they're not going to be nearly as good as me.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.120]   So I should just do it.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.480]   It's like, you know what, it takes them twice as long, still more successful for me.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.400]   And eventually they'll be efficient at it as well.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.280]   Like I learned, there was a point where I didn't know what I was doing and I figured
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.080]   it out and got better.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.800]   So they will too.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:43.280]   And so as that's grown, like that's really been, so I've taken a lot of focus around
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:49.840]   that over the past year or two of, you know, hire people, I pay them well.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.400]   Like I try to make sure that the people that are supporting me are paid well, but still
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.760]   recognize like if I'm going to keep growing the way that I want to be growing, I need
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.840]   to set a certain price point on my time and anything where I can pay someone less than
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.680]   that to support me, I need to let go of that and send it down to them.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.960]   So I've been doing a lot of that to try to build out my time and have hired a number
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:16.880]   of outsourcing partners and virtual assistant folk for various pieces of what I do.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:22.640]   So some web design, some editing work, some basically like a personal assistant style
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.040]   person.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.560]   So a piece of it has been that just letting go of things and sort of do the whole, you
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.000]   know, make sure you're spending as much time as possible on your highest, best uses, not
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.040]   all of which are dollars.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.120]   So like that might be getting paid for writing or speaking something, or that might be reading
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.360]   for which I don't literally get paid, but that's what fuels the whole engine, the knowledge,
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.880]   the continuous learning and let go as much as possible.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.560]   So like that, that's been the starting point that's been helping a little, I'm finding
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.880]   I'm still like business and opportunities and things are growing faster than that.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.920]   And so, you know, now I'm even going through the second round of, you know, I've got some
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.160]   businesses and things that I do that I feel very personally attached to because I've helped
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.760]   to build them, but you know, I can only build and be involved in so many things.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.080]   Maybe some of these things I just have to let go of entire change, entire business lines
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:15.360]   and recognize, you know, maybe this is something my partner can just run with on their own,
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:21.680]   or maybe this is a service that I do that, you know, is good dollars for what it is,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.840]   but I can't get to the next level by continuing to do it because it's just not going to grow
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.880]   or scale or build in the way that the other things are.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.520]   And again, I found like I can kind of convert this to a, all right, what's really the value
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.000]   of my time by continuing to do this.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.320]   If that number isn't good, then either I need to figure out how can I make the value higher?
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.080]   How can I, you know, delegate it or shift it to someone else?
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.880]   And if I can't figure out how to do either of those two things, maybe it's something
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.080]   that I just need to let go.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.360]   Right.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.480]   And I suck at letting go.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:56.720]   So this will be my challenge over the next six months is figuring out how to let go of
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.360]   a thing or two.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.320]   You and me both.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:02.640]   I'd like to wrap up by talking for a couple of minutes about financial advisor marketing.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   In my years as a financial advisor, I've often heard experienced, successful
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.120]   financial advisors say, "Marketing doesn't work.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.480]   Only prospecting works."
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.240]   And I'm interested in your take on that comment.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.640]   And I'm interested in trends that you see in the industry as comparing marketing and
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.440]   prospecting.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.240]   Oh, man.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.200]   Marketing doesn't work.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.240]   Only prospecting works.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:36.720]   So, and just as a corollary to that, because I'm going to bash in a moment, so I need to
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.400]   set it up as a framing point.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.360]   So the other version that we hear is like, "Marketing doesn't work.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.880]   I just get all my business from referrals."
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.920]   Sort of the similar version of it.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:53.680]   So like, you know, and financial advisor in my world, I love financial advisors.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.640]   I love my peers.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.240]   But...
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:02.400]   We suck at marketing.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.960]   We are terrible marketers.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.440]   I know an extraordinary number of very, very successful financial advisors.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:15.760]   And like, I'm sorry, but they succeeded despite themselves.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.880]   Not because of themselves and their great ability to build businesses and market and
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.440]   the rest.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:26.720]   They succeeded by an unbelievable amount of perseverance and grit and chutzpah and all
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:31.280]   that stuff that they basically drove through the sheer failings that they were doing along
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.560]   the way and managed to attract enough people that they got to a viable business.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.600]   Their, what should have been a three-year building cycle was a seven-year building
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:37.920]   cycle.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.880]   But hey, they got to it.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.840]   It's great on the back end.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:44.960]   And the compounding still works later, even if you compound more slowly early on.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.880]   It's like, there's just an extraordinary number of people to me that like, they got
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:54.800]   there in spite of themselves and marketing, not because marketing does or does not work.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:01.680]   And I find like we, I think certainly in our advisory world, we put ourselves in this
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.400]   trap.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.080]   Marketing work, marketing doesn't work.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.160]   Therefore, I won't spend anything on marketing.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.440]   And at the end of the year, when I don't get any clients off of the almost nothing I
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.560]   spent on marketing, it's definitive proof that marketing doesn't work.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:17.520]   So like there's this, we do all these studies in the industry of like, where do advisors
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.280]   get clients and pick your survey, but like 80% of advisors drive the majority of their
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.040]   new business off of getting referrals.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.280]   I'm like, okay, but if you also look at the industry and benchmarking studies, the average
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.400]   advisor spends less than 2% of their revenues on marketing.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.960]   So if you basically, and if you drill down to that, most of that revenue is like, I did
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.160]   an appreciation event for my clients, which is basically another opportunity to get referrals
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:40.720]   off of them.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:46.560]   So like, if the only money you ever spend on marketing is a combination of nothing or
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.640]   events specifically designed just to drive referrals, and then you say the dominating
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.880]   portion of all new business comes off of referrals, it may actually simply be because you've
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.000]   been so horrifically bad at ever executing any form of marketing.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.680]   Like referrals is not a best practice because marketing doesn't work.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.320]   Referrals is all you have left when you do no marketing.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:04.640]   Right.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.400]   Right.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.480]   Like, and I think, I think that's very much the trap that we've gotten into certainly
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.120]   for the huge majority of our industry.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.080]   You know, referrals are the referrals are the result of what happens when you don't
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:23.440]   have a marketing process, not proof that marketing is, doesn't work for our industry.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.200]   Now, that being said, marketing is hard.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.280]   Marketing takes sustained effort.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.880]   Marketing takes a targeted focus.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.560]   We're, we're really not execute.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   We're not well educated and trained about how to execute marketing effectively in the
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.200]   first place.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:41.680]   I think that actually the biggest challenge for advisors, not with saying how much I just
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:44.960]   like ranted about the fact that we don't spend anything on marketing and do anything
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.840]   on marketing.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:49.120]   Frankly, most advisors, they did start spending money on marketing, it wouldn't work.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.920]   And the reason it wouldn't work is so many advisors, the end of the day are basically
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.400]   generalists.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.240]   I do anything for everyone who comes in my door who can afford to pay my fees or willing
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:58.960]   to pay my fees.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.960]   Like you can't, you can't market that.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.000]   Like, what are you going to do?
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.080]   Hey, if you can fog mirrors and have money, I can work with you.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.880]   Like nobody resonates with that marketing, right?
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.200]   Right.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.960]   Like, oh, I fog a mirror and have money.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.840]   I should work with this guy.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.640]   That'd be brilliant.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.760]   He has years of experience.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:23.600]   So like until advisors get more targeted in who they try to serve, I don't know that
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.920]   they can necessarily be effective in marketing anyways.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:29.120]   Cause when you're a generalist, basically you're going to compete against other generalist
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.720]   marketing, which basically means you're going to compete with either large national
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:38.560]   brands that actually can spend, you know, extraordinary seven, eight, nine figure dollar
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:43.680]   amounts on marketing, you know, national insurance companies, wire houses, major financial
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.480]   services firms.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.360]   And you're going to compete against, uh, basically consumer publications who say, oh,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.160]   and if you don't want one of those large national brands, we'll show you how to do it
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.640]   yourself.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   So, you know, money magazine and Kipler magazine and Yahoo finance and CNN and all that.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.560]   So between massive publications that try to give people information about how to do it
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.880]   themselves and massive financial services companies that do general broad-based marketing.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.520]   Like you basically have no chance to stand out as an affidavitual advisor doing marketing
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.720]   by just trying to be a generalist and spending money on marketing.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:12.960]   Right.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.240]   So, so then you get back to what really is a crossroads of two choices.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.080]   Either you can just not do marketing and try to succeed by the sheer perseverance of finding
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.640]   how many hands you can shake and prospecting until you get enough clients, which frankly
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.920]   is what most people have done historically.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.840]   Or you acknowledge that if you really want to be successful, you actually have to have
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.040]   some kind of specialization, some kind of niche, some sort of target market where you
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.600]   can actually try to communicate with a group in a much more targeted manner, reach them
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.200]   effectively and actually have a differentiated message.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.720]   And I think that's where we're starting to see certainly the advisory world going forward
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:50.960]   now.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.680]   It's still slow, but I think there's this growing recognition of like being a general,
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.480]   being an undifferentiated generalist is really becoming a problem.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.680]   You got to find some way to specialize, niche, be different.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.160]   And frankly, the problem I see for a lot of people, even in trying to do that transition,
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.680]   going back all the way to what we were talking about earlier, if you're going to go down
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.760]   that road, we're right back into the three years it takes to be known, liked and trusted.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.880]   And that's a really long time.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:21.040]   And especially if you get like the quick hits off of not that they're that quick, like the
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.400]   quick hits off of prospecting.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.560]   So you're like, "Hey, I can do all this niche thing and feel like I'm going nowhere for
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.320]   three years, or I can go work my ass off in prospect, but at least I found a client or
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:30.560]   two."
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:37.200]   We get addicted to the faster feedback of what still is rather ineffective prospecting,
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.720]   but we get addicted to the feedback of the prospecting that we don't want to do the slow
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.960]   build, even though the slow build is the one that has the big payoff on the back end.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.120]   So people that I see build their business off prospecting, it's a one, two, three, four
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:49.680]   growth rate.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.920]   When I see people that build it off niches and specialization, it's a one, two, five,
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.800]   10 growth rate.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.720]   And so it doesn't feel like it's doing any better to do the niche thing.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.640]   In fact, frankly, it might even be slightly slower on the front end.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.240]   The payoff is much bigger on the back end, but it's hard to remove ourselves from the
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.720]   addiction of like, "I just feel like I've got control.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.920]   If I go out there, beat the streets, I know I'm doing some activity, I'm prospecting,
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.160]   and then I got a client, so here's proof that it worked."
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:14.400]   Right.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:14.560]   Right.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:23.200]   Do you see in here in 2015, what do you see as some effective ideas that people can implement
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.000]   to how to just get started with a marketing plan for themselves or their firm?
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:40.160]   I mean, to me, for advisors or really anybody who wants to do anything in building a business,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.840]   particularly like a service business, a personal brand style business for yourself, you got
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.560]   to decide who you're going to work with and who you're not going to work with.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:46.720]   Right.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:52.480]   Until there's a strategy about who you want to reach, your marketing dollars, efforts,
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.400]   time, all the rest of that just aren't going to do anything.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.160]   Because if you don't know who you're going to reach, you're not going to do something
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.000]   that moves you in the direction of reaching them, so you're not making progress.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.240]   I mean, it really starts with that end, which means...and most advisors don't want to do
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.760]   that and don't want to go there.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.720]   And again, this is even really specific to advisors.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.760]   I see this across clients we have in the industry.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.800]   I see this across small businesses.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:26.080]   It's a mentality shift around just recognizing that while it feels good to be able to do
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.440]   business with absolutely anybody you meet, I'm a generalist, I can work with anyone,
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.520]   therefore I can do business with anyone that I meet.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.320]   The people you meet don't really want to do business with you because it doesn't feel
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.520]   like you're someone who's specialized in solving their problems and issues.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.080]   And when you take a narrower focus, yes, strictly speaking, you will turn away a lot of people
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.200]   who don't fit your niche, but you will be able to do business and be much more likely
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.240]   to do business with everybody you find that does hit your niche.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:03.360]   And so, to put it in sort of our industry terms, you can go out there and meet 10 people
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:09.760]   and have a 10% close rate and get one client, or you can go out there and meet a bunch of
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.320]   people and have a 10% close rate and get one client.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.000]   And you can go out there with a focused niche where you can only work with 20% of the people,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.120]   but you close them all.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.920]   And so, you only meet two people, but you close them both.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.280]   And so, it feels scary because you went from 10 prospects to two, but you went from one
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.040]   client to two.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.560]   So, you're going to have fewer prospects, but you actually double your growth rate.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:37.440]   And it's that phenomenon of the virtue of the niche and the focus and the specialization
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:43.200]   that you have, and you're going to drastically reduce the number of prospects that you have,
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.280]   but you will drastically increase the number of clients that you have because, in essence,
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.440]   if you go into the math to it, your close rates go up dramatically more than your prospecting
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.480]   rate goes down, and you end out ahead.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.720]   And I can speak to it having done a whole bunch of niche businesses over the years.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.280]   It's really true.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.360]   You close people so much more when they feel like you're special to them and unique to
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360]   you.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.360]   And you get way more business.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.320]   And frankly, you get way more business for less work because you don't have to spend
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   as much time on the nine prospects that don't do business with you.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.520]   I spend a whole lot of time on people who do business with me and remarkably little
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.840]   time on people who don't.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.440]   Because if you're not into my thing, by the time you read my blog and my website and all
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.040]   the other stuff that I do, I view those as screening tools.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.040]   Self-pruning.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040]   If you're looking self-slept, self-not-to-be-a-client.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.680]   I'm going to make my stuff as dense as possible for you because if you don't like that, you
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   won't like me.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.680]   But if you keep reading that and you like that, then you're going to love the rest of
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.200]   the stuff that I provide.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:51.320]   And I really view much of my website and my tools like they're not magnets to bring people
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.240]   in per se.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.960]   They're like pruning opportunities to screen people out.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.840]   So the only people who really come all the way through the pipeline are people who really
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.240]   feel a connection to me and want to do business with me, in which case I would love to do
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.040]   business with them in any way that I can.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:11.080]   Are advisors waking up to this change?
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.840]   I'm not sure that they are.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:19.600]   I think advisors are waking up to the fact that the generalist thing, I can work with
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.040]   anyone and do anything so I've got to cast my net as wide as possible.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.900]   I think they're waking up to the fact that that's a problem.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:27.900]   They're seeing more people.
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.560]   They're not necessarily getting more business.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.880]   I know lots and lots of advisors that'll say, "I work so much harder than I used to even
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.040]   to try to get clients, find clients, prospect, find a way to prospect for them.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.400]   No more do not call lists.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.480]   Everybody's more closed off."
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.460]   All the challenges, prospecting's clearly gotten harder than it used to be and getting
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.720]   results from it is harder than it used to be.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:52.480]   So I think there's this growing recognition that the way we've done things is not as effective
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.820]   as it used to be.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:54.820]   And I hear that everywhere.
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.080]   "I used to seminar market.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.080]   It doesn't work as well anymore.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.080]   I used to cold call.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.080]   It doesn't work.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.640]   I don't know how people have built their business off cold calling.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.280]   It doesn't work as well anymore."
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.960]   There's all these things that we know used to work that didn't really work anymore, all
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.880]   of which I think are expressions of this problem of the denser and the more crowded the marketplace
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.120]   gets, the less it works to just be a generalist.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.240]   You'll get prospects but they won't be clients and it's hard to even get good prospects.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.520]   But I'm not sure.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.600]   I don't think very many advisors at all have really gotten to what you have to do with
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.720]   the next step, which really I think is kind of a leap of faith.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.720]   It's one I've done.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.800]   I can vouch that it works, but really kind of this leap of faith of if you take a greater
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.920]   focus and you accept that you're going to have far fewer prospects, you can do business
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.520]   with so many more of them that you still end up with more business in the end.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.240]   And it's that transition I don't think we've gotten there yet.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.600]   And the reality is no advisor can serve 5,000 clients.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.600]   You can serve 150, 150 somewhere.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:02.120]   If that, I mean, that's always to me been one of the comic things about how many advisors
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.920]   fear casting a narrower target net of like, but if I narrow it down, will I be able to
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.800]   get enough people to work with?
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.600]   You can't work with them all.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.600]   You can't work with the close.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:18.040]   I mean, I know a huge number of advisors that have fantastic careers and make as much money
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.920]   as they need to support themselves, their family, their kids, their retirement, everything
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.560]   else with like 50 to 100 of their top quality clients.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.880]   That's all they don't even need more than that.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880]   Right.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:34.800]   Like you're like there's 300 plus million people in this country and you only need 50
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.040]   of them to have a good business and you're worried about being too narrow?
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   Like seriously?
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.120]   I mean, I like I met a guy out there.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:50.680]   He specializes with bass fishermen because you know, all fishermen would be too broad.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.680]   Okay.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.840]   Bass fishermen.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   He grew up on a lake.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.400]   He used to be involved in bass fishing tournaments when he was young.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.320]   He got involved in that community.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.160]   I had no idea, but apparently bass fishing has like million dollar prize purses.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.120]   Like they're big tournaments in bass fishing.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.280]   And when people win prizes in tournaments, he's the guy.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.280]   Right.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.280]   He's the guy.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.280]   He's the guy that everybody calls.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.000]   He's the guy everybody knows in that community.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.700]   And so, you know, he's like 30 something years old and manages something like a hundred million
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.880]   dollars and 90% of his clients are bass fishermen.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.320]   It's amazing.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.200]   So like, I'm like, you know, if you can build a wonderfully successful practice with bass
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:32.140]   fishermen, I'm sorry, but like, you know, good luck coming up with a narrower niche
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.140]   than that.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.240]   That that wouldn't work.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.240]   Right.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.200]   Like it's it's because we need so few people.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.960]   You know, like if I was trying to build a business and I'm some large national firm
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.280]   and like I need something that gets at least 10,000 new clients a year or a hundred thousand
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.160]   or millions if I'm a tech company, right, like the whole all the equation, the math
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.700]   changes and everything looks different.
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.400]   You have to tackle in a different way.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.940]   But in a world where like I just need 50 to 100 top quality clients to have an amazing
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.320]   life and business and career, you like you can't go to too narrow.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   Right.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320]   Right.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.620]   Like you don't even have to say you're in the I mean, I know people who have made niche
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:14.480]   businesses like I just work with expatriates who are being repositioned from the US to
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.720]   a particular country in Germany, in Europe or something.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.280]   And like that's their niche, just cross national expatriates between the US and Germany.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.560]   And you know, there may not be a ton of them, but there are a few.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.000]   They do tend to be in rather high paying positions.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.580]   They're often executives at companies.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.380]   They have very unique specialized problems.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:38.320]   How do you navigate like German tax law and US tax law?
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   Amazing niche.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:44.200]   And like, I mean, I know one guy that does this like he hardly sees any of his clients.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.680]   They're a quarter of the way around the world.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.760]   So like you need 50 to 100 people, not even just out of the 300 million Americans, you
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.280]   need 50 to 100 people out of the what are we at like 7 billion on the planet?
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.280]   Exactly.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.840]   And that's the shift that just it seems people don't see.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.880]   Yes, in the old days when you only could maybe work in your geographic area face to face,
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.380]   how would you find 50 people that were bass fishermen in one town?
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:11.280]   There's one guy and he's the one who doesn't win the tournament.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:17.600]   But in a world where you can instantly connect with anyone across the world, it's game changing.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:23.560]   And to me, like the, you know, I guess like it's come at the right time for us, you know,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.040]   the good fortune of the world and how it evolves.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:33.280]   Like to me, the the rise of the Internet and just sort of everything around how we can
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.840]   find and connect with people online and just find information and find service providers
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.640]   and find experts and all these different things.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:45.240]   You know, the Internet is the enabler for niche and specialization of work for advisors
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:51.840]   or really any industry or business going forward that like that's what makes it feasible to
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.740]   find the 50 human beings on the planet that fit your target clientele.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.440]   And you can actually get all 50 of them.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.880]   In a way that you just couldn't before when you had you had to do it one to one face to
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:07.160]   face prospecting because there was no other way that people were going to find you.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   Right.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.280]   Well, Michael, thank you for making the time and thank you for all you do for the advisor
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.280]   community.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280]   My pleasure.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.400]   One young advisor to someone who's living a few more years down.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.200]   I've really benefited from your work and I know you work a lot and I thank you for it
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.080]   because it's been very helpful to me.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   Happy to help.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   Hope it's food for thought.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.720]   Now, here's the takeaway that I'd like you to take from this interview.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:33.240]   What do you need to be doing to set up the circumstances so that your career can be advanced
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.780]   in ways similar to Michael's?
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:41.600]   Because what he did, maybe by accident, maybe not, who knows if that was almost a false
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600]   humility.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.180]   What happens is in our society, if, for example, if I came on here and said, "Every action
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:51.640]   that I've taken over the course of the last decade of my life was very carefully calculated
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:59.760]   to provide the maximum effect," that would sound a little bit strange to you.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.800]   So it would sound a little bit scheming to many people.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.120]   So often we don't do that.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.000]   And by the way, I'm not accusing Michael or anybody of shading the truth.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.960]   We just have a more positive memory of ourselves usually in our past successives and we try
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.240]   to downplay them.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:21.000]   So I did well in school, but it came easy for me instead of saying, "Yeah, I worked
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.060]   these 18 hours to study for every test," or whatever the example is in your situation.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:29.200]   So I'm sure that it was probably a little bit accidental, but I'm also sure that it
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:35.080]   was probably also just that Michael has put in a lot of hours of hard work.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:40.160]   So the key is the things that have been effective for him, can you take some lessons from those
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.460]   and apply them to your life?
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.680]   Can you apply some of his work ethic to your own situation?
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.000]   Maybe make some time to go and learn who the leaders are in your industry and attend those
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.160]   conferences and develop a subject matter expertise in a specific area that's useful in your world
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.800]   and then share that with others.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.720]   You might share it in the form of written content in blogs or writing on industry magazines.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.640]   You need to develop your writing skills, so it might be good to start with a blog.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.520]   You don't have to get permission there and that's what might get you broader distribution
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.680]   down the road.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:18.920]   You might want to develop it with podcasting or with speaking or with a YouTube channel
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:25.200]   or with whatever other new technology comes down the pike.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.360]   Whatever you choose, though, just know that you don't have to sit around and wait for
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.440]   things to happen by accident.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.720]   You can put the work in that makes it more likely that you'll be able to achieve the
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.080]   results that you're looking for.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.160]   Other thing I would just say, notice of Michael's story.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.960]   I'll tell him and I will tell you about him and you would find this if you study his work.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.820]   Michael is one of the most diligent, hardest working people I know of.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:55.420]   He is consistent, he is prolific, he works hard.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:00.920]   To me that's comforting because I'm not sure that I can ever be really confident in talent.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.880]   Some people seem to have a built in talent.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.040]   Some people seem to have innate ability.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.560]   But personally for me, I've never really been all that confident in my built in talent or
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.160]   in my innate ability.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.000]   I've always taken comfort from watching how hard some other people work and recognize
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.240]   that though I might not have natural skill, though I might not have natural ability, I
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.260]   can choose to work as hard as I am able to work.
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.680]   And then in time I might get some results.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.640]   I don't have to compare my results to someone else after all.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.920]   Somebody else might have had a 10 year head start on me.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.040]   Michael is certainly more influential in the financial advisor space than I am, but that's
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.040]   okay.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.760]   He's been working at it for 15 years and I don't need to worry about that.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.360]   I can only just focus on controlling the things that I can control and ignore those things
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.880]   that I can't control.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.600]   But I can choose how hard I work.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.280]   I can choose to show up.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.240]   I can choose to be consistent.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.680]   I can choose to work hard to create interesting thoughts and useful information to share with
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.680]   other people.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.920]   And then I can just simply do my bit.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:11.000]   And then I can just simply choose to apply that over enough time for hopefully for me
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.840]   to get results.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.840]   That's it.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.840]   That's the primary things I wanted to share with you today.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.720]   I hope that you enjoyed this interview.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.200]   I hope it was helpful to you.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.960]   I certainly enjoyed having a chance to talk with Michael and I encourage you to check
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.640]   out the body of his work at Kitsis.com.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.320]   If you have a chance to see him speak or read any of his books or read any of his work,
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.600]   I would encourage you to check it out.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.760]   For those of you who are interested in the very technical side of financial planning,
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.680]   it's the best online resource that I know of to help you answer some of your more technical
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.960]   questions.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:44.040]   If all you did was read through the archives of his blog, you would really have an excellent
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.840]   foundation for your knowledge.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.080]   Thank you to those of you who are patrons of the show.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:56.080]   The Patreon campaign is going well as of today as I record this, February 17, 2015.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:02.020]   We currently have 37 patrons total of the show and $378 per month of monthly pledges.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:06.920]   Our first goal is $2,000 per month and when we get to $2,000 a month, we will replace
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.760]   the intro music.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.040]   Yes, that intro music.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.280]   Although this is kind of the outro music.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.680]   I might just replace the intro music and keep this as the outro music because I like to
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.240]   get dancing in the middle of the day whenever I do this and music is generally good for
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   that.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.240]   But that's our initial goal.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.240]   We're almost 25% of the way there.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.120]   I'd say we're about 20% of the way there.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:29.200]   So if you want to get there quickly, basically, let's see.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.160]   If one third of the audience contributed a buck a month, we would be at $2,000 a month.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160]   So you can do the math from there.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:41.280]   But if every member of the audience contributed, well, my math is messed up.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.360]   If you contributed a couple bucks a month or three bucks a month, we'd be done and we'd
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.160]   be at $6,000 a month.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.400]   It's kind of sad when a financial advisor can't do live math.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.920]   Thank you also to those of you who have been leaving reviews on the new apps.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.920]   If you'd like to listen to the show on your smartphone, just go to the App Store and download
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.920]   it.

[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.880]   Media App Store and also in the Amazon App Store as well.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.160]   Thank you for leaving reviews on that app.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.840]   I appreciate that.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.080]   Thank you for spreading the word about the show.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.920]   If you find the content to be helpful, I just appreciate that so much.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.400]   I know many of you will suggest the content in a forum or suggest it in an email to a
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.960]   friend and that type of information is so helpful.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.320]   Those are the referrals that really matter.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320]   Tell a friend.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.800]   Just tell them, "Check the App Store," and they can learn how to get rich and stay rich
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.520]   and how to do it in an efficient way.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.520]   That's it.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.520]   I'm out.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.840]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:46.120]   If you'd like to contact me personally, my email address is Joshua@RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:53.500]   You can also connect with the show on Twitter @RadicalPF and at Facebook.com/RadicalPersonalFinance.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:19:00.360]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education and financial enlightenment, but
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:06.640]   your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.120]   about you.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:16.720]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent and trustworthy
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:23.400]   and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific needs, your
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:28.960]   specific goals and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.120]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.880]   and I make mistakes.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.320]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please help me by coming to the show page
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.720]   and commenting so we can all learn together.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:20:00.840]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
