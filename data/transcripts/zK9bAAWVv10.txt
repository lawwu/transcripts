[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   We are still considering what the Apostle Paul has to tell us about himself in the first
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.280]   chapter of his epistle to the Romans and in the section that runs from the middle of verse
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.240]   7 to the end of verse 15. And at the moment we are considering in particular what the
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:32.660]   Apostle tells us about his own work and especially his attitude towards that work. He's already
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:42.400]   dealt with it in various ways and we've already considered that. We've noticed that he describes
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:51.720]   it as a service of God whom I serve, he says. We've considered the way in which he renders
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.500]   that service in my spirit. We've considered his more exact description of his service
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:10.480]   in the gospel of his son. And fourthly, looking together at the Apostle's consciousness of
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.080]   his power. Now that is the thing that's emphasized in the eleventh verse. He says, "For I long
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.720]   to see you, that I may impart unto you, pass over to you, pass on to you, some spiritual
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.720]   gift to the end, that ye may be established." And that was the thing that occupied most
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.520]   of our time last Friday evening, the Apostle's consciousness of his power. In the fifteenth
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.920]   chapter he says that he knows that when he does eventually visit them, it will be in
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.040]   the fullness of the blessing of the gospel. He has no doubt about that at all. And we've
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.900]   looked at other examples and illustrations which we find in the Apostle's epistles which
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.120]   tell us the same thing. He tells the Thessalonians that when he preached to them his gospel was
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:17.240]   not in word only, but in power and in the Holy Ghost and with much assurance. And we
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.840]   drew certain deductions from that. Certainly there is nothing more important for all of
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.000]   us, whether we be preachers from pulpits or whether we preach the gospel in conversation
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.260]   or in some other way, nothing is more important than that all our service should be rendered
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.240]   in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. And the Apostle therefore doesn't hesitate
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.680]   to say that he longs to see them, that he may impart unto them some spiritual gift.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.760]   We also interpreted that, pointing out that he didn't mean one of the spiritual gifts
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.360]   that are listed in 1 Corinthians 12, but rather the very thing that he does in his epistle.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.720]   The spiritual gift he wants to impart is more knowledge, more understanding, and so on and
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.920]   so forth. But now having dealt with that we come on to the next verse, the twelfth verse,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.640]   which begins with the two interesting words, "That is, I long to see you, that I may
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   impart unto you some spiritual gift. To the end, ye may be established. That is, that
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.800]   I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me." Now this
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.320]   is obviously a continuation of the previous matter, a continuation in the sense of being
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.640]   a qualification of it. In other words, he's made a statement and then he says, "That
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.440]   is, I want to be careful about this," says the Apostle. "I don't want you to misunderstand
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.480]   it. I'm longing to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift. That is, that
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.240]   I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   Now this little expression, "that is," is a most interesting one, and we must look at
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.120]   it carefully. I indicated when we began considering this particular section that while it doesn't
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:41.800]   explicitly set itself before us with the claim to be dealing with doctrine, that nevertheless
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.440]   it is packed with doctrine, full of doctrine, if we are wise to see it. The Apostle is just
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.240]   rarely writing and putting himself right with these people to whom he is writing. But in
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.400]   doing so and in dealing with what seem to be mere matters of arrangement and so on,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.380]   we have seen already that doctrine is peeping out at us everywhere, and profound doctrine
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.900]   at that. And we shall find the same as we see what he really wants to say by these two
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.400]   words, "that is."
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:23.760]   Now a better translation perhaps would be this, that "that is," that we may be mutually
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:31.440]   encouraged by each other's faith, yours and mine. I think that puts it much better.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.040]   Very well then, what is the Apostle saying? Well obviously he is first of all modifying
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.200]   somewhat his previous statement, but only modifying it to this extent, that he doesn't
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:53.080]   want them to think that he is, as it were, setting himself up on a pedestal, and that
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.720]   he is patronizing them. And that he is saying, well of course I am a great man, a great Apostle,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.360]   and you are just ordinary church members, and I therefore have so much to give you,
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.360]   lest anybody might think that he at once goes on to say, "that is." Don't misunderstand
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.800]   me, says the Apostle. That isn't the spirit of the way in which I am writing at all.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:26.560]   No, he says, I am longing to come in order that I may be encouraged as well as you.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.680]   Now the word "comforted," as we've got it here in the Authorized, is a little bit misleading.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.680]   It wouldn't have been misleading at the time of this Authorized version in 1611, but by
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.400]   now it is a bit misleading, because we tend to give to the word "comfort" one meaning
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:50.440]   only. So it's better perhaps to regard it as "encouraged." The Apostle is going to
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:57.920]   encourage them, but he hastens to say that he is quite sure also that he is going to
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:06.880]   be encouraged by them. It's going to be a great exchange. He realizes he's got a great
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.520]   deal to give to them, but he wants them also to know that they've got a great deal to
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:19.840]   give to him. And it's going to be a kind of mutual exchange. There's going to be an
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:26.880]   encouragement on both sides. He's going to be encouraged, and they're going to be encouraged.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:34.920]   In other words, he is depicting here what we may well call the communion of saints.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.280]   And he is assuring them that he's going to find that they're going to be a great stimulus
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:47.760]   to him, as he is going to be a stimulus to them. And this encouragement is something
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.000]   that's going to affect the whole of his personality. It's going to affect his mind. It's going
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.440]   to affect his heart. It's going to affect his faith. It's going to affect his whole
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   being. Now that's what he's saying here. He's really looking forward to spending time
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.320]   amongst these people. He knows very well that the result of that will be that his heart's
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.520]   going to be warmed. He's going to be stimulated in his own work. He's going to be encouraged
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.080]   to go on with it. He's going to be more certain than ever of his Christian faith, and so on.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.960]   Now that's what he's saying by this little word, "that is." It's going to be a great
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.280]   kind of exchange.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:44.160]   Now obviously it's very important for us to realize that as the apostle says this, he's
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:52.460]   doing so quite sincerely and quite genuinely. This isn't a sort of mock modesty. It isn't
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:09:04.700]   a mere bit of politeness. It isn't the language of the court here, who just uses these ingratiating
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:13.800]   and gracious phrases. No, the whole point is that the apostle rarely means it. And we
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.460]   must understand that he means this quite as much as what he meant in the eleventh verse.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:26.440]   He was there absolutely certain of his power. He is here equally certain that he's going
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:33.960]   to be one who is going to benefit by this exchange that will take place when he visits
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.520]   the Roman Christians.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:45.560]   And indeed, if we understood verse 11 correctly on this question of power, this addition here
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:51.080]   shouldn't trouble us at all. There's no contradiction involved. Someone may feel that
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.280]   this is nothing but an obvious contradiction. He says with one breath that he's got this
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.720]   great ability and power to give them. But here he's saying that he's going to receive
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:10.480]   as well, and they're going to give to him. No, there's no contradiction for this reason.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.900]   The apostle always makes it clear that any power he possesses is not something innate
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:26.080]   in himself. It is the power of the Holy Spirit in him. It isn't he as a man. It isn't
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.720]   even he as a Christian. The great power he had as an apostle was, as we've already
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.840]   seen, something that was given to him. He was called to it. He was empowered. It is
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.720]   the Spirit that's in him.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.280]   So you see, in spite of that, he's a Christian like all others, and he can receive from all
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:53.600]   others, he can benefit from all others, and he can have this true fellowship with them.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.680]   As a Christian, the apostle Paul is exactly the same as all other Christians. He is an
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.760]   apostle, yes. He's been given a very special power and a special authority, yes, but that
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:14.780]   doesn't in any way make any difference to him as a Christian, as a believer, as a member
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:20.560]   of the body of Christ, as one who is the same as all other Christians.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.640]   Now, he's very fond of saying this. He says it in many different places. You'll find
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.920]   him saying it in the first epistle to the Corinthians. In the third chapter he puts
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:39.680]   it in a well-known statement like this. "So then, neither is he that planteth anything,
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.000]   neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase." He's dealing there with
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.800]   the fact that some people in Corinth said, "Ah, Paul's the man." Others said, "No,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.960]   no, Apollos is the man." He says, "Why are you wasting your breath and talking thus
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:02.120]   about Apollos and myself?" "Neither is he that planteth anything," that's Paul,
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:09.560]   "neither is he that watereth," that's Apollos, "but God that giveth the increase."
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.000]   And again he says it in the next chapter, chapter four of the first Corinthians and
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.240]   again in the seventh verse. He says, "Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:27.840]   hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:35.240]   as if thou hadst not received it?" That's exactly the same thing. All these gifts are
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:43.700]   given by God, and therefore, in spite of them, the men qua men, the Christian qua Christian,
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:51.360]   is the same as all others, and thus this great sharing becomes possible. Nevertheless, surely
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:00.260]   it is something remarkable and astounding, and something which is worthy of a comment.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:06.040]   I read to you at the beginning those extraordinary statements that the apostle makes in chapters
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:14.020]   eleven and twelve of that second epistle to the Corinthians. "If ever a man had cause
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:20.680]   or reason to be proud of himself, it was the apostle Paul. If ever a man," to use our
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:27.480]   current phrase, "had reason for losing his head, it was the apostle Paul. If ever a man
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.520]   had reason to be passed up and to think that he was marvelous and wonderful and superior
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:43.520]   to everybody else, it was this amazing mighty man of God. In visions, in experiences, in
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:54.580]   usefulness, in suffering, in every respect, he does stand out preeminently. And yet, it
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:00.660]   is this man who knows what it is to be carried up into the third heaven, and to learn and
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:07.620]   to hear something of the language of paradise, which is unrepeatable because of its glory.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:16.840]   That's the man." Well, writing to these ordinary simple Christians in Rome, many of whom were
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:23.080]   but the servants in Caesar's household, says that he's looking forward tremendously to
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:28.840]   being with them. He's got a great deal to tell them and to give them, yes, but he is
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.360]   looking forward equally to listening to what they've got to say. He wants to hear their
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:40.040]   experiences. He wants to know what they have received of the Lord and how the Lord has
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.240]   led them on. He is longing, he knows it's going to be a stimulus to him and an enrichment
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.400]   to his life. His heart's going to be warmed. He's going to be a man who's going to derive
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:59.880]   a great benefit. What a wonderful picture. Well, I think it's so wonderful that we must
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.040]   draw certain lessons from it, because I feel it has got a great deal to say to the Christian
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:14.880]   church of the present time. But let's start with ourselves first. Let us examine and test
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:22.220]   ourselves in the light of what the Apostle says here about himself. What is the first
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:28.480]   thing you look for in anybody you meet? It's quite clear the first thing the Apostle Paul
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:35.920]   looked for in all others was the Spirit in them. I mean by that the Holy Spirit that
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.960]   was in them. That was why he longed to be with these people. He knew that they had received
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:50.040]   the Holy Spirit as he had. That's what he looks for everywhere. You remember when he
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:57.240]   arrived at Ephesus, he found certain people who were called disciples. And at once he
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   felt there was something wrong, so he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Ghost
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.840]   when you believed?" He sensed at once that they hadn't, so he puts his question to
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.200]   them. How sensitive he was to that. That was the thing he looked for in everybody. He wasn't
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:20.000]   interested in the color of their skin. He wasn't interested in their nationality.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.760]   He wasn't interested in their social status or standing. He wasn't interested at all
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:31.240]   in the school or the university or what corresponded to that in those times that they'd attended.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.360]   The thing he looked for was this. Is there a brother? Is this a man with the Spirit of
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.200]   God in him? Is this a man with whom I can have fellowship because he is in Christ as
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:49.580]   I am in Christ? That was his way of judging people. That was his way of looking at people.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:56.260]   That was the thing that immediately interested him in people. He looked for the presence
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:01.480]   and the manifestation of the Spirit of God. He looked for a fellow member of the body
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.520]   of Christ, and all other matters were completely irrelevant. They just didn't enter in at
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:14.760]   all. That's not only the Spirit of the Apostle Paul. It is the Spirit of the whole of the
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:21.080]   New Testament. There is nothing more marvelous in the New Testament than just that. And I
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.560]   take it there is no better test of our profession of the Christian faith this evening than just
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:35.800]   this test? What do you look for in another? What are you delighted to meet and to see
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:44.280]   in another? What is it you put first? There is no more profound test of us than just that.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:50.000]   But let me go on to a second statement. The Apostle not only looked for this in others,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.960]   when he found it, he greatly enjoyed it. And he benefited from it. And of course the thing
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.600]   we want to impress at this point is this, that it didn't matter how simple a Christian
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:13.720]   was nor how lowly, Paul got something from him. He enjoyed talking to them. He enjoyed
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:21.280]   looking at them. His heart was warmed by them. He was stimulated by them. And again this
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.960]   is something that is true everywhere in the New Testament, as it has been true in the
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:37.120]   history of the Church amongst the saints throughout the centuries. Do we enjoy the company of
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:47.320]   all Christians? Or must they be of a particular type? Must they be highly intelligent? Or
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:54.920]   must they, well, dress in a particular manner and have the appearance of belonging to a
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:04.760]   certain social status? I sometimes put the question like this. Would you sooner spend
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:15.780]   a number of hours with the humblest Christian than with the most elevated and exalted non-Christian?
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.840]   That's the test. If you had the choice, the opportunity, to visit the greatest in the
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.480]   land who is not a Christian, would you put that on one side in order to talk to a humble
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:34.320]   Christian who has an experience of the grace of God in his heart and who can talk to you
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:43.440]   about the things of the Spirit and share experiences with you? This mighty, this amazing man, this
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:52.200]   chiefest of the apostles, is eagerly looking forward to taking his seat by the side of
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:58.400]   these humble people in Rome because he knows he's going to enjoy it. It's going to ravish
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:06.280]   his heart. Very well, that leads us on to the third principle, which is a very important
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:12.920]   doctrinal one. The others have been mainly experimental. I come now to a very important
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:22.720]   doctrinal point, especially today. I see here the whole doctrine of the nature of the Christian
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:33.880]   Church introduced. First and foremost, I see the glaring, striking, amazing contrast between
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:45.280]   this, the greatest leader that the Christian Church has ever known, and many modern leaders
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:53.600]   in the Christian Church. Here is a man looking forward, a great apostle looking forward,
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:07.880]   to being in Rome. But what a contrast to the Pope of Rome today. You notice this man doesn't
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:16.520]   say that when he comes to Rome he will be willing and ready for them if they desire
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:27.040]   to have an audience with him, and will allow them to kiss his big toe. All right, I agree
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:33.280]   with you. In one sense it is something to laugh at, but it's a fact, isn't it? That
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:42.080]   is a fact. He doesn't say that he, seated upon the throne, will at given times by appointment
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:49.400]   allow them to come into his presence and there humble themselves before him.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:58.480]   Where have these things come from, do you think? With the New Testament open before
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:06.440]   us, how are these things even conceivable? There is nothing of that here. He is going
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.680]   to be one of them, amongst them. He is going to receive from them as well as give. He doesn't
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   say that he is longing to visit them in Rome in order that he may give them his blessing.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:31.800]   And they can then go away and say that they have received the blessing of the great apostle.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:38.480]   He doesn't claim to be some vicar of Christ in some exceptional and unique manner.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:46.680]   Now, my friends, I am referring to these things because we are living in days and times when
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:52.880]   many Protestant people, it seems to me, because of the bogey of Communism, seem to be almost
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:59.760]   ready to align themselves with that kind of outlook upon the Church that is such a complete
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:08.280]   denial of the New Testament. We must think these things through again. That, I say, is
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:15.760]   a denial of this. Here is the greatest apostle the Church has ever seen, and yet look at
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:24.360]   him humble and meek and lowly. That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.120]   mutual faith of both of you and of me.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.580]   There is no hint anywhere here or anywhere else in the New Testament of a monarchical
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:46.140]   idea in Church government, none at all. There is not even a hint or a suspicion of Caesaral
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:53.960]   papism. It is the exact opposite of it. All that has been borrowed from the Roman Empire.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.000]   It has nothing to do with Christianity. It is something that has been imported into the
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:07.760]   Scriptures. And I put it thus with feeling because I am more and more convinced that
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.080]   it is that kind of thing that is ever and always has been the greatest hindrance to
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:22.600]   true revival in the Church. Alas, that that day should ever have dawned when an emperor
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   called Constantine should have said that he had become a Christian and that his empire
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:35.520]   had become Christian also, and that the Church should have compromised with the world. And
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:44.120]   all this idea has come into the Church of princes and lords and great men whom you can
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:50.040]   only approach at a distance and who are able to give blessings but never seem to receive
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:59.200]   anything at all. All that is suggested here, it is so different, isn't it? Not only from
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.520]   the teaching of the Apostle Paul, but also from the teaching of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:12.000]   Listen to him in Matthew 20 as he puts it like this. In verse 25, Jesus called them
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.560]   unto him and said, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them,
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.680]   and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you,
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:31.560]   but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister. And whosoever will be
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:38.760]   chief among you, let him be your servant, even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:51.040]   unto but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." Oh, Christian Church,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:57.320]   what has happened to thee? How can she ever have forgotten these blessed words? And the
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.080]   example and the illustration of the great Apostle, and the Apostle Peter, you will find
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:09.160]   teaches exactly the same thing. When he addresses a word to the elders of the church in his
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.000]   first epistle in the fifth chapter, he says, "The elders which are among you I exhort
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.280]   who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.960]   of the glory that shall be revealed. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:30.600]   the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:37.080]   a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being in samples to
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:44.320]   the flock." None of this "lord" idea, not lording it over them, but as examples
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:52.080]   to the flock, as being with the people, concerned about them, ministering unto them, sacrificing
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:58.440]   for them, mixing with them, even as this great Apostle says he is longing to do with the
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:04.520]   members of the church at Rome. But surely, says someone in saying all that, you are denying
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:11.600]   the whole principle of authority. No, I am not. What I am asserting is this, that the
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:18.680]   only authority in the church that the New Testament recognizes is spiritual authority.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:26.920]   I mean by that authority given to the men, not given to an office, but to a man. There
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:32.400]   is no inherent authority in an office. The authority is the authority of the presence
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.520]   of the Holy Spirit in the man. So that this same Apostle, who can be so meek and humble
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:45.000]   and be genuine as he is, can also reprimand severely, and say to people, "Be ye followers
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.760]   of me. I am alone your Father in Christ, though you have had many instructors." And as he
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:58.040]   says it, you do not feel that he is exalting himself. He is not exerting himself. He is
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.880]   simply saying this, that he has been called to be an Apostle, he has been given the authority
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:12.160]   and power, nothing inherent in him, but he has this power of the Holy Spirit in him.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:18.480]   And it is in terms of that, and because of that, he asks them to be observers of him
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:24.440]   and to be followers of him. I say therefore that it is not an office as such that constitutes
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:34.880]   authority. The authority is the authority of the Holy Spirit himself in the person.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:41.900]   And that is why one of the great problems confronting the whole Christian church today
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.260]   is just this very problem.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:50.740]   Now it all began in a sense just over a hundred years ago, with the so-called Anglo-Catholic
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:56.340]   movement started by Keeble and Newman and Pusey and others. What was their problem?
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.900]   It was this. They said the Christian church is not counting as she should and as she used
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:09.020]   to. What can we do about this? Where can we look for authority and get authority back
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:18.380]   into the church? And their fatal blunder was to say this. They said the way to restore
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:29.780]   authority is to take the preacher, the pastor, away back from the people, hedge him round
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:37.780]   with an authority, make him wear certain vestments, deck him up as it were, exalt his office.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:44.340]   The people, the priest, call him father, give him some special authority. They built up
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:52.740]   the authority of the priesthood, thereby intending, I say, to restore the authoritative power
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.380]   and preaching of the church.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:01.540]   But what a complete misunderstanding of just this twelfth verse in this first chapter of
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:08.540]   Paul's epistle to the Romans. "I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:15.700]   spiritual gift, to the end he may be established, that is, that I may be comforted together
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:21.980]   with you by the mutual faith, both of you and me." You had no need to take the apostle
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:28.820]   Paul and separate him by a barrier from the people and deck him up with vestments and
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.660]   various other things to give the impression that he is some great power or some great
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:41.820]   lord or some great emperor in order that he might have authority. No, no. He can afford
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:49.180]   to take his seat amongst the people, and yet they all know that here is a man filled with
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:57.820]   the authority and the power of the Holy Ghost. He has no need of any adventitious aids. His
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:05.260]   only power is the demonstration, the power and demonstration of the Spirit. So he can
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.620]   afford to mix with the people and be one of the people, and there is no risk and there
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:19.140]   is no danger. It is the authority of inspiration, the authority of the Holy Ghost himself.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:25.060]   And if you read the long history of the Christian church, you will find that it is always the
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:36.060]   same. George Whitefield's authority resided in his being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.640]   And everywhere he went and preached, people recognized the authority and they crowded
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:47.620]   after him by the thousands. But the bishops did not like it and tried to prohibit him.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:53.220]   He was breaking rules. They said he was not conforming to discipline. He had not this
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:59.140]   authority. The only answer was that the authority was patent, as men and women were broken down
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:06.500]   in conviction, cried out for salvation, and thousands were brought to the new birth. And
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.900]   so it has been, I say, throughout the long centuries.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:17.340]   Oh, my friends, there is nothing more important than this. The whole tendency today is to
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.980]   repeat the error of the 1830s. Look at the position. They say the masses of the people
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:28.100]   are outside the church. What is the cause? Well, the church is lacking in authority.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.500]   She is divided up into groups and sects and denominations. They say the only thing to
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.820]   do is this. Let us all come together. Let us have a great mammoth church. Then we will
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:44.780]   have power and authority. It is surely an utter contradiction of this. That is not how
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:52.260]   it becomes in the Scriptures. No, no. One man filled with the Holy Spirit can be used
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:59.400]   of God in a way that a mighty organized church without the Spirit cannot be used and can
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:13.500]   achieve nothing. He knows his power, but also he is aware of this strange doctrine which
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.700]   enables him at one and the same time to be the unique, outstanding, amazing apostle and
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.300]   yet a man who can sit down on the same seat or the same bench as the humblest Christian
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:30.780]   who has slaves and serfs and tell them, "You know, it has done me good to be with you.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.420]   I am feeling better for this bit of fellowship we have had together. My heart has been warmed.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:46.060]   My faith is strengthened. Oh, that the Christian church came back to this apostolic, this primitive,
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:51.780]   this New Testament pattern." And that leads me to my next point, my last point under this
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:57.860]   heading. Here, clearly, we are given a very wonderful picture, a striking picture of the
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:08.060]   church as a fellowship. And the church is always meant to be a fellowship. And here
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:13.900]   again, surely, is something that we are tending to lose sight of. A church is not meant to
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:20.220]   be a place in which one man does everything and nobody else does anything. A church is
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:25.700]   not a place in which one man alone speaks and the others just sit and listen. That is
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:32.140]   a part of the ministry of the church. But that alone is not a church. That does not
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:37.660]   constitute a church. Obviously, it is vital to the whole being and genius and essence
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:44.500]   of a church that there should be this mutual exchange that the Apostle speaks of. "Your
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:51.820]   faith," he says, "and mine." Comforted together by the mutual faith, both of you
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:57.620]   and me. "I'll give, you'll give." There will be a giving and a receiving on
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:10.660]   both sides. Now, in other words, the Apostle here asserts that their faith is very important
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:16.940]   and that their faith has a very definite place in the life of the church. The Apostle Peter
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:22.220]   says exactly the same thing in his second epistle. The very first verse, he says this,
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:31.380]   that he is writing to people who have the like-precious faith with us. He's an Apostle.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.820]   He's got faith, the Apostles have. Yes, but these other people, he doesn't know
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:44.460]   them, strangers scattered abroad, like-precious faith with us. They've got it. John writes
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.620]   in the same way, "Why am I writing my epistle?" He says, "Well," he says, "I'm
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:54.740]   doing it for this reason, that he may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.660]   is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ." Yes, but they are to come into
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.740]   the same fellowship. They're to take part in it, this grand exchange.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:14.860]   Now, the whole New Testament conception of the church is in terms of this fellowship,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:21.380]   where the emphasis is clearly upon the faith of the individual members of the church, as
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:29.140]   well as the faith of the preacher. How is this faith to show itself? Because obviously
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:38.100]   it does. How was Paul thus to be encouraged and comforted by these Roman Christians? Well,
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:48.700]   their faith would show itself, and it did show itself, in their lives, in their living.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.760]   It was obvious to people that something had happened to them. They no longer did the things
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:59.620]   they used to do. There was a change in their lives. That's a demonstration of their faith.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.700]   And the apostle was encouraged by seeing that sort of thing, in spite of his great labors
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.180]   and his great success in his labors. It was something he was looking forward to. He'd
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.180]   never been to Rome. He was looking forward to seeing these little groups meeting in one
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.580]   another's houses. These are the people whom the grace of God has taken hold of and to
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.460]   whom the gift of faith has been given. There in Rome, it was going to happen. It's to
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:30.660]   be seen in life. It's also to be seen in knowledge.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:37.160]   What could be more encouraging to a man like this than to see people who'd had no educational
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:43.540]   advantages at all, many of them, as I say, slaves in Caesar's household, yet with an
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:50.100]   astounding understanding of the scriptures, of the doctrine of scriptures, enlightened
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:56.100]   in the matter of the faith, able to talk about these things, able to discuss them, able to
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:07.660]   rejoice in them? Faith shows itself in knowledge and understanding, and also in experience.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:17.120]   Is there anything which is more heart-warming than to hear other Christians telling you
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:24.860]   about their spiritual experiences? I know of nothing, I think I've said this before
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:33.780]   to you, which is such a tonic to me in my Christian spiritual life, than to read the
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:44.300]   lives of saints. I commend it to you. You'll never read too much of such literature. Read
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:51.100]   about a man like David Brainerd, or Jonathan Edwards, or Henry Martin, or any one of these
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:57.260]   saints of God, Robert Murray M'Cheyne. Oh, go after them, my friends. Many of them are
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.740]   out of print. Go to the evangelical library. You'll get them there. Go anywhere where
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:08.340]   you can get them. Buy them second-hand, and read them, and you'll read there of God's
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:14.020]   dealings with the souls of these men, the manifestations they had of Christ and of His
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:21.620]   love, and it'll warm your heart, it'll stimulate you. Their faith shows itself in
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:28.660]   that way. They sought the Lord, they sought His face, and He was pleased to reveal Himself,
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:35.580]   and He poured His love into their hearts by the Holy Spirit. It shows itself like that.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:42.780]   And then it shows itself, of course, in growth, and in development, and in increase. There's
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:48.980]   nothing more encouraging to a minister, to a pastor, than to see his people growing visibly
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:55.480]   in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord. You feel they've got an understanding which
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.820]   they didn't have a year ago. Their whole outlook is bigger. They're not just going
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.140]   on repeating catchphrases. They've delved into the doctrines. They're taking hold of
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:12.020]   something. It's a great privilege. That is why I think the calling of a minister, a pastor,
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:17.300]   is the greatest calling in the world that any man can ever be called to. There is nothing
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:24.020]   I know that's comparable than to watch the Holy Spirit dealing with people, searching
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.740]   them, examining them, revealing truth to them, and you watch their development and their
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.340]   growth. Well, no, that was the sort of thing the apostle was looking forward to. And not
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:42.860]   only that, faith shows itself in concern for others. It shows itself, therefore, in prayers.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:50.180]   And you'll find that this apostle was constantly praying for these ordinary, asking these ordinary
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:56.620]   Christians to pray for him. Now it sounds monstrous at first, doesn't it? That this
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:05.220]   man, with his unusual experiences and all his extraordinary glimpses into the eternal,
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:11.260]   that such a man should write something like this. "Now I beseech you, brethren, for
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:18.220]   the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:28.140]   with me in your prayers to God for me." This man felt he needed the prayers of the
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:33.820]   Roman Christians. That's, you see, a part of the whole life of the church. A church
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:39.500]   is a fellowship. Though he's such a great man and a unique servant of God, he needs
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:45.620]   their prayers. He thanks the Corinthians in the first chapter of the second epistle that
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.920]   their prayers were partly responsible for his recovery from an illness. He writes to
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.820]   the Philippians and says, "I don't know what's going to happen to me, but it may
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:59.980]   be the will of God, as the result of your prayers as well as mine, that I may again
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:08.340]   be set at liberty and I may come to visit you." He pleads for their prayers. And in
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:17.260]   these various ways, he longs to be in Rome in order that he may see their faith, the
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:26.060]   mutual faith, both of you and me. In other words, my friends, for me to leave you with
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:33.140]   the doctrine, let me put it like this. The greatest danger, perhaps, confronting us as
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:41.920]   Christians today, is to think in terms of movements instead of churches. In the New
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:50.700]   Testament it's always churches. Our tendency is to go in for movements. And so often in
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:56.140]   the movements we are but passengers, as it were. Everything's done by somebody else.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.420]   It's like that in the whole of life today. People don't even enjoy sport themselves,
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:07.060]   they just watch other people exercising themselves and playing the game. It's the same in the
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:13.820]   church. We are lookers on, we just sit down, others do everything. No, no, the picture
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:22.100]   here is of people exchanging experiences, thoughts, understanding, mutual giving and
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:30.660]   receiving, helping one another, and all participating in this together. And I think you'll find
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:36.500]   that the history of every revival that has taken place in the church from the very beginning
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:44.980]   until now confirms and substantiates all this. Whenever you get a true movement of the Spirit
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:52.360]   of God, you always get Christians meeting together in this way in groups for fellowship,
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:59.300]   the Methodist class meeting. There were similar societies before. It's invariable. You always
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:05.980]   get it. And it's inevitable because like attracts like, and like longs for like in
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:14.220]   a world of sin and of shame. Christian people have always liked to be together and to talk
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:19.020]   together about these things and to help one another and to stimulate one another. Their
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:26.860]   hearts are warmed, their feelings are kindled, their aspirations are stimulated. And thus
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:36.940]   as a great fellowship, you and I, the mutual faith both of you and me, we together enjoy
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:46.420]   the things of God and pray to him together. And his blessing comes down upon us together.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:54.780]   And so the church is revived, and a revived church solves the problem of evangelism.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:06.940]   Well, may God give us grace to see all that was in the apostle's mind when he said, "That
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:19.580]   is." That is! Not only I, you also. Not only my faith, your faith, in addition. Let us
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:31.680]   pray. O Lord our God, we thank thee for the fellowship of Christian minds. We thank thee
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:42.260]   for the society of thy people. We thank thee that we who once were so far off have been
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:49.820]   made nigh by the blood of Christ. That we are no longer strangers and foreigners, but
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:46:00.460]   fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God. O Lord, we thank thee for
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:06.540]   the fellowship here on earth. But we thank thee that while we are in this, we know we
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:15.460]   also belong to the heavenly Jerusalem in the church of the firstborn. O Lord, wilt thou
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:22.420]   open to us more and more what thou hast for us even while we are here on earth and in
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:35.620]   this world of time, that we may more and more taste of the firstfruits of the full harvest
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:44.900]   that awaits us beyond time and this world, when we shall be with thee in glory. O God,
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:53.900]   we thank thee for the church on earth, and we pray that more and more she may be like
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:47:03.140]   the church in heaven. And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:09.380]   love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:19.420]   us now and until we shall be in glory. Amen.
