[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   All right, we got one here from Jeff. Jeff says, "Does context switching affect
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.600]   reading comprehension?" Yeah, it does. If you're trying to read a book, but you keep initiating
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.480]   context shifts, like you have to keep checking your text messages because there's like a
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.240]   conversation going on, or you keep checking your inboxes, or if you're like me the last few days,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.600]   you're constantly checking updates on the baseball collective bargaining agreement coming together,
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.720]   you're going to remember much less from the book. Your mind is going to have unrelated
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.040]   networks that are activated and some relevant networks inhibited. You won't understand that
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.600]   as well. So if you're reading something you care about, just read. And if you want to communicate,
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.840]   go off and communicate. Separate those two things.
