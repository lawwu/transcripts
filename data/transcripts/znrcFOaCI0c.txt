[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]   - Gold has captivated people for centuries,
[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.920]   whether as a hedge against inflation, a shiny keepsake,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.080]   or a means to turn a quick profit.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.040]   But there is more to gold than meets the eye.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.920]   From Costco selling gold bars that fly off the shelves
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.840]   to people who score massive profits
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.720]   on limited US mint drops,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.720]   the modern day gold market is so full of surprises.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.120]   In today's episode, I'm joined by Trey Benedict
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.280]   who knows the ins and outs of this market
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.880]   and is the founder of Pure,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.000]   one of the biggest places to buy and sell gold online.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.320]   We're going to break down the myths and realities
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.240]   of gold investing, the dynamics of spot pricing,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.100]   and how you can navigate and profit in this market.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.440]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and if you enjoy this episode,

[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.160]   Trey, thanks for being here in person early in the morning.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.080]   - Yeah, thanks for having me and glad to be here,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.520]   you know, before everything gets crazy, so.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.000]   - Yeah, yeah, we're doing this early
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.900]   'cause the gold markets.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.320]   But I guess let's start with the gold markets.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.160]   How big is the gold market?
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.520]   - The gold market's pretty large.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.120]   So you've got like your, you know, larger like central banks
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.680]   which is like, you know, obviously governments
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.360]   trading around gold to hedge their currencies
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820]   as well as reserves.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.840]   Then you've kind of got like the market makers,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.280]   which is like, you know, your JP Morgans
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600]   and like, you know, hedge funds and stuff like that
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.440]   of the world.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.320]   And then you've got kind of more of like this like
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.160]   retail segment as well that's really kind of adapted
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.800]   in this last like, you know, 30 to 40 years
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.120]   since they've actually made gold legal to own in the US
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   since the 70s.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.040]   So it's kind of like, you know, there's this expanded market
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.720]   but if I had to put like an actual number on each,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   you know, the large markets, like in the trillions,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.720]   like it's quite a lot, like there's a lot of gold
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.620]   in just the overall market.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.800]   And then the market makers, you know, obviously
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.480]   are kind of in the billions area.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.160]   And then like our retail sector for like gold bars
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.720]   is around 55 billion.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.680]   So, you know, it kind of depends on which segment
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.520]   you're looking at.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.560]   - Okay, and good backup.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.080]   So gold was not legal before the 70s.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   - Yeah, so gold was outlawed in 1933
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.440]   when the currency of the US changed from actual gold coins
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.020]   to what we now have as like, you know,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.420]   federal reserve currency.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.700]   So treasury notes kind of replaced what used to be
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.260]   like a gold backed currency.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.100]   And then the first bullion coins were the Krugerrand
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.020]   and the Krugerrands from South Africa.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.740]   So I know a lot of people kind of, you know,
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.300]   used to buy those and you still see them nowadays.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.700]   But then the US started wanting to play a little bit more
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700]   in that market and they realized how much money
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.060]   South Africa was making.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.780]   So they produced the gold eagle
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.200]   and production started in 1985.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.120]   But the first actual US gold coins since the 30s
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.440]   was these things called like an arts medal.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.840]   So they literally, you'd send the post office
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.800]   like 30 bucks in the mail and they'd send you back
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.040]   like an ounce of gold.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.240]   And so that was like the first adaptation
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.160]   to, you know, retail investors getting involved
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.080]   in the United States.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.660]   But the gold eagle seemed to be like quite a hit
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920]   and it's still kind of like the top coin around the world
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.600]   for people who are buying like retail investments.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.480]   And then they also introduced like the buffalo as well,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.600]   which is a 24 karat gold coin.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   So the buffalo is quite a pure gold coin
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.720]   is to compete with the Canadian maple leaf.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.440]   And it's pretty successful and it's like launched.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.600]   So the US has done quite a good job
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.960]   of getting into the retail sector market, so yeah.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.720]   - For those on audio, we'll get into a little bit
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.200]   of my recent foray into gold,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.840]   but I'm holding a buffalo and a few other coins here.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   Why do you think people are buying these, right?
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.840]   Is it to own gold?
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.240]   Is it collector's items?
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.600]   Is it speculation?
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.800]   - Yeah, so I think there's a couple,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.360]   also a couple different types of people that buy them.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.000]   I think, you know, the first off is kind of your,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.760]   like I'm scared of the government taking away like,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.320]   you know, currency and like, you know,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.120]   the dollar going down,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.040]   which is not something I personally subscribe to,
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   but like, you know, I can understand
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.580]   why people would be hesitant
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.680]   and why it could cause some anxiety for some people.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.320]   So, you know, having some sort of tangible like asset,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.920]   whether that be like, you know, collectible or art
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.000]   or something to hold a store of value,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.080]   I think that's one kind of area.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.560]   And then I think the other thing is, you know,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.820]   obviously gold is kind of like on a massive run
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.080]   the last like year and a half ish or so.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.680]   And I think, you know, general heightened like tensions
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.480]   with the election and like in kind of like politics
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.120]   and just like overall around the world,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.520]   like people have seen gold as like a place to, you know,
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.800]   park a little bit of extra investment cash.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.320]   So I think people would typically go for physical gold
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.200]   just 'cause it has a premium over like, you know,
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.880]   buying like just, I mean, you know, the regular ETF,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   but you could obviously just go buy an ETF
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.160]   and get the same exposure.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.200]   So I think it's just kind of choice there,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.240]   but obviously there's some collectability and some coolness
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.720]   of just like holding some gold in your hand.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.960]   So I think it's always cool to be like,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.480]   oh, you know, it's like a gold bar.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.000]   So it's like, that's a fun thing for all that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.840]   So, yeah.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.000]   - Though full disclosure for people listening,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.320]   in my idea, a one ounce gold bar that costs,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.480]   you know, 2,500 plus dollars,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.400]   depending on where the price is when this comes out,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.440]   always seemed like it was gonna be a lot.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.520]   And then I picked it up and it's like, you know,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   the size of like 10 playing cards, right?
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.600]   Like, and that's in the plastic case,
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.480]   out of the plastic case, it's like two postage stamps wide
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.520]   and like a quarter of an inch high.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.480]   So I just, I had this idea when I went to Costco
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.080]   the first time and bought a gold bar and I thought,
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.760]   oh, I'm gonna have this big gold bar and bring it back home.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.560]   And my wife was like, well, make sure people don't see you
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.960]   carrying it around the parking lot.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.560]   And I was like, yeah, it fit in my pocket by like,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.400]   you know, it's smaller.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.840]   It's about the size of a credit card.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.960]   - Yeah, and I think people often get like confused
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.920]   of how dense gold is.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.360]   Like it's quite a dense metal,
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.560]   even when you compare it to something like silver,
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.680]   palladium or platinum, like it is much, much smaller.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.200]   Like an ounce of gold is just like, it's heavy.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   You can like feel it in your hand.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.080]   And sadly we don't have a kilo bar here,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.840]   but kilos are interesting.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   If you were to have a cell phone made out of gold,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.000]   that's basically what a kilo would feel like,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.120]   but it's quite heavy.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.520]   Like you feel it and you've got some heft to it.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.200]   - So you mentioned you're 22.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.320]   I imagine most people are thinking someone who loves gold
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.920]   and is, you know, thinks about it a lot is closer to 75
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.240]   or 80 than 22.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.000]   How did you get into this?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.480]   - Yeah, so I got into this basically because of my dad.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   He's kind of likes buying and collecting,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.960]   you know, different stuff.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.480]   And he introduced me to coins when I was a kid.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.720]   I used to go to coin shows in North Carolina.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.960]   That's where I was originally from.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.480]   We describe them now as like redneck coin shows.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.400]   Like you go and there's like a whole bunch of like,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.200]   you know, people you'd see like from like places
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.160]   you've never heard of.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.960]   And they just have all these coins in front of you.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.160]   So I would always look for Chinese coins,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.560]   but he was interested in buying gold.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.280]   This was like a bit after the 2008 recession.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.120]   So like, obviously I think there was some like,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.040]   you know, fear and anxiety in his mind
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.160]   on like how to like keep, you know, assets stable.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.400]   But like, I think, you know, he always wanted to kind of,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.520]   you know, include me in what he was doing.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.080]   And so I was able to figure out very quickly
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.120]   that you can make a lot of money on coins.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.880]   And so I would just start flipping Chinese coins
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.720]   back to China.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.560]   And it was super fun and, you know,
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.720]   made a lot of money as a kid.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.680]   - So out of curiosity, making a lot of money as a kid,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.520]   what is that like?
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.120]   Tens of dollars, hundreds of dollars?
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.600]   - I would say like my biggest score as a kid was like,
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.160]   I made like 10 grand off of a coin
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.800]   that I had bought for like 400 bucks.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.960]   And so I was like, probably in like seventh grade.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.840]   And I had bought this like Franklin half dollar,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.800]   just like basically generic silver coin.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.360]   And it was graded already.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.560]   So it was in like one of the holders that, you know,
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.880]   PCGS or NGC are like grading companies.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.800]   Same as sports cards, you can get them certified
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.560]   and have like a specific number attached to it.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   And so I was able to get that number up,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.440]   upgraded pretty quickly by like, you know,
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.000]   using different techniques
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.360]   that restoration people would use.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.200]   So I was pretty good at doing like what they would call
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.720]   just coin restoring.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.200]   So I'd be able to identify, get it re-graded
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.600]   and then be able to sell it again.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.400]   And that was, that's kind of like a specific path
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.640]   that a lot of people do in the coin industry
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.280]   to make like a lot of money.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.040]   So you can do that at higher volume or lower volume,
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.760]   depending on like, you know, your budget.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.240]   - And that's allowed.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.600]   It's not like a gray area.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.120]   - It's like a, you know, you don't go around telling people
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.640]   like you're like a coin doctor.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   You go around telling people like, hey, you know,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.600]   like I'm a coin dealer and like I have nice coins
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.440]   and here they are.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.700]   So like, you know, the results kind of speak for themselves,
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.320]   but obviously you're not gonna like disclose
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.960]   all of this information of how you've done it to people.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.760]   And so that's kind of like the trade secret, I guess,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.200]   to like why some coin dealers are better
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.360]   than other coin dealers.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   But that's particularly with rare coins.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.520]   I think, you know, generally like the other stuff
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.320]   is more of bullion, which is boring to them.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.880]   That's kind of like how they perceive bullion
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.160]   in this realm.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.480]   - Maybe cover the difference there.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.420]   There's bullion and how does that market compare?
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.800]   What are the different aspects?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.080]   - So most rare coin like collectors
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   would describe them as numismatists.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.120]   Like they are the collectors of rare coins
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.280]   and bullion sort of branches into numismatics
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.760]   and the fact that there are coins that are bullion
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.560]   that happen to become rare.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.320]   Like, you know, a gold buffalo could become rare
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.280]   if the mintage is low and that's happened.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.660]   Like some gold eagles are worth like, you know,
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.440]   two to three times their spot value
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.320]   just because they're rare and people collect them.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   But modern markets are a little bit different
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.480]   in the fact that, you know, a lot of them have to be graded.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.240]   They have to be like, kind of have that stamp of approval
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.720]   that they're like a 70.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.760]   A 70 is like the perfect grade.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.640]   But for rare coins, it's very rare
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.500]   that you would see anything above a 67.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.560]   Like a 67 is like quite a nice rare coin.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.360]   And rare coins, you're usually not traded
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.920]   upon their spot value.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.600]   People really just don't care.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.520]   Like, you know, you could have a $20 St. Gaudens,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.640]   which is essentially the equivalent
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.260]   to a gold eagle these days.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.400]   But it could trade very rapidly differently
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.920]   than a gold eagle does just because, you know,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.320]   the eye appeal and like the scarcity,
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.680]   as well as just like, you know,
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.960]   people may like it better than the other one
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.780]   so they pay more.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.600]   So I think it's more unique into that fact.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.720]   So it's hard to kind of quantify
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.400]   why someone would want to pay more for the gold value.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.680]   But I think it's just like, you know,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.400]   as there is with art, like people will pay more
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   just because they like it.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.660]   - Now, when it comes to actual gold,
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.680]   similarly, there's no intrinsic value, right?
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.240]   This isn't an income producing asset, but it has a value.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.200]   How is bullion and gold kind of more broadly
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.440]   than just rarity and coins valued and priced?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.960]   - The first thing that people look at is like,
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.360]   is it denominated?
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.000]   Like, you know, is it an actual coin or is it a bar?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.080]   So I think for, you know, a buffalo and an eagle,
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.800]   they're actual $50 coins.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.040]   So they have a little bit more use case in people's mind.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.200]   - Now, obviously I paid way more than $50,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.480]   but worst case for this buffalo,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.800]   I can take it to the US government,
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.480]   you know, or a bank and get $50 from it?
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.240]   - Yeah, I mean, theoretically, you could go to Taco Bell
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.600]   and buy some tacos with it.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.840]   But I think that would cause some problems
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.000]   if you tried to do that.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I don't think, there's like random YouTube videos out there
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.880]   of, you know, people being like provocative,
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.560]   trying to like turn in their gold at, you know,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.920]   some random fast food and it just doesn't work out.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   But I think that, you know, generally people start
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.280]   from like who's, who made the coin or bar.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.480]   And so, you know, for bars, that's like the assayer
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.920]   versus the coins, the mint.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.720]   So you just wanna be able to make sure
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.080]   it's like a reputable assayer mint.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.600]   And obviously like, you know, the United States men
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.560]   and Pamp Suisse are like quite reputable
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.040]   and so their name brand.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.240]   But yeah, I think, you know, people generally look for,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.640]   is it like a government coin?
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.440]   And then if it's not, is it a reputable assayer?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.200]   - An assayer is the person who creates the bar?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.400]   - So an assayer is a person who refines
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.560]   and actually produces that bar.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.400]   So for Pamp Suisse, it's Pamp Suisse.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.320]   Like they are the assayer and refiner.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.440]   So on every bar, you can see kind of like
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.400]   who is the actual assayer of that place.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.360]   So on the back, there'll be a signature of that assayer.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.880]   Not exactly sure who it is,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.920]   but there is a certified assay on there.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.720]   - Ilana? - Yeah, Ilana.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.480]   Shout out Ilana. (laughs)
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.960]   But yeah, so you can kind of generally see like,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.320]   you know, is it reputable based upon that?
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.440]   And then from there, it's, you know,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.080]   like just choice of design.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.240]   So people kind of look and they're like, you know,
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.120]   what is the design that I like?
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.640]   And, you know, what will hold the most value?
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.480]   That's kind of the question I always get
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.320]   from people who are like quote unquote investors in gold
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.200]   is like, what will always have the most resale value
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   in the future?
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.280]   And generally the more kind of premium products
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.040]   like Pamphortunas and Buffalos and Eagles
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.840]   kind of have that like extra added value.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.880]   Like you're always gonna be able to get
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.880]   like a certain value, like pretty close to the spot value
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.240]   if you hold one of those compared to OPM metals,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.880]   like that's a random brand that's like unaccredited now.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.720]   And you're not gonna get very far over the spot value.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.640]   Like essentially that's gonna be melted down.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.520]   But premium product like, you know,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.160]   Fortunas and Buffalos are always gonna have
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.240]   like the value of the gold
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.400]   plus maybe a little bit of premium value
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.800]   just because there is that like inherent resale.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.840]   - And the value of the gold,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.440]   talk a little bit about spot price
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.560]   and how that market works.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.520]   - Spot price, it kind of is a little bit different
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   than your general like, you know, stock trading hours.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.640]   Like it's similarly follow.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.360]   So every Sunday at 3 p.m. PST.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.440]   So that's kind of when the like, you know,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.320]   market opens in our eyes.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.080]   So overseas, you know, there is gold trading starting then.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.560]   So people who are like very serious about, you know,
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.760]   the market and following it will be kind of
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.920]   at their computers like ready to go at 3 p.m. on Sunday.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.480]   And so you have 3 p.m. on Sunday,
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.520]   24 hour trading all the way until Friday at 3 p.m.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.240]   So it's quite some time that you, you know,
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.680]   you have to be kind of involved in the market.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.560]   So, you know, in the middle of the night,
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.240]   the whole spot price could move up or down,
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.960]   you know, 50 to $60.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.120]   And you would never know until you'd wake up in the morning
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.000]   unless you're like, you know, trading overnight.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.640]   But I would say the larger like physical traders
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.360]   are fully hedged.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.560]   Like they have zero risk to the market or very little risk.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.480]   So they're trading on what we call the premium.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.760]   So the premium is just basically like our positive
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.160]   or negative markup on the actual physical items themselves.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.560]   So like buffalos are like, you know,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.680]   between 2% to 3% premium right now.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.640]   And fortunos are like between 15 to $30 premium.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.200]   So essentially, they're always trying to make a spread
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.920]   upon, you know, like what that premium is
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.440]   rather than the spot price itself.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.120]   I think this is a little bit different than, you know,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.600]   general investors like perception,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.960]   because the general investor perception is like,
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.920]   what is my all out price that I'm gonna get?
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.600]   And you would quantify that by the spot price
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.520]   plus or minus the premium that you would have.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.600]   So it's a little bit different between the two.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.080]   - So someone's actually like making a bet
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.440]   that these gold buffalo coins
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.320]   are going to be worth more than spot price in the future.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.200]   And so they're kind of not worried
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.920]   about what the spot price of gold does.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.400]   Whereas I'm imagining a retail investor buying GLD,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.440]   the ETF is solely concerned with spot.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.120]   - Yes, yeah, it's like literally the opposite mindset
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.760]   between someone who is like actually a trader
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.960]   of physical metals versus someone
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.840]   who's like a retail investor of the GLD.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.400]   The physical traders are, yes,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.600]   they're trying to create a supply and demand market
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   based upon like what the scarcity of that specific item is.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.160]   So there are some really interesting items
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.920]   that, you know, Costco could easily offer
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.840]   that actually fluctuate quite a bit.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.640]   We quantify those as like proof gold.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.240]   So it's like a buffalo,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.160]   but it's in a collector strike version.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.360]   And so the background of the buffalo
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.240]   is actually like a high like polish
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.040]   versus this is just like,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.960]   we would call that like a burnish strike.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.600]   People would trade these like collector coins
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.400]   at a higher premium and they'll fluctuate quite a bit.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.000]   Like, you know, they'll go from $200 an ounce over
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.600]   to $500 an ounce over,
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.400]   depending on like how the spot prices move.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.120]   - For the average, you know, person who's like,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.400]   I wanna invest in gold.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.320]   I think it's a good hedge against inflation.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.120]   So I'm buying gold ETF or even buying gold bars
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.000]   or you know, whatever.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.040]   What's causing that spot price to move?
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.080]   - Yeah, it's a little bit beyond my control
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.640]   of like how I think about it.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.280]   Like, but I think generally it's like, you know,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.320]   economic data that comes out.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.720]   Like nearly every like FOMC meeting,
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.960]   there's some movement,
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.840]   but I mean, that's the same in stocks.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.600]   Like, you know, some stuff will go up,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.000]   some stuff will go down.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.400]   And then, you know, just like geopolitical tensions,
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.640]   like we'll kind of always have our eye on different stuff
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.120]   just to make sure that, you know,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   like whatever hedge position is open is like, you know,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.200]   staying clear of like different events.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.640]   So I think, you know, general market makers
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.880]   obviously are selling to like larger people.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.720]   So they always try and mitigate risk
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.640]   by understanding all of this data.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.320]   But to a retail investor,
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.200]   I think it may be a little bit beyond our control.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.080]   - So it's not too dissimilar to most speculative assets,
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.920]   right? - Yeah.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.680]   - Like Bitcoin is priced at what it is
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   mostly because of supply and demand.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.560]   - Yeah.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.840]   - But when you said a lot of the traders
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.680]   are trading these coins, do you mean coin traders
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   or do you mean like the JP Morgans of the world?
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.880]   - There are a couple larger firms
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.440]   that trade physical metals,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.960]   like not really as much as they used to.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   Like Scotiabank used to be a pretty large trader of metals.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.600]   And, you know, HSBC is still pretty big,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.800]   but their access is very, very limited.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.960]   Like they still run a physical trading desk.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.720]   So you can call them up.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.440]   They'll probably tell you, you know, like,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.840]   hey, you need some enterprise account to like trade with us.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.080]   But I mean, if you have the means to do it,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.960]   you could possibly buy from them
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.360]   and maybe even sell to them.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.680]   But it's very difficult now
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.320]   just because like people running physical gold desks
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.200]   is a thing of the past.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.880]   It used to be quite large in like the '80s and '90s.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.120]   But nowadays, like most of it's done on computers
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.800]   and warehouses that we would never know where they are.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.200]   - And when I'm buying GLD
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.920]   or kind of something from my computer
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.900]   on my brokerage platform,
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.680]   is there physical gold somewhere?
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.920]   - Yeah, so there's a couple different types of GLD.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.080]   There's like allocated versus non-allocated.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.920]   So somewhere around the world in some Comex depository,
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.640]   there's probably a 400 ounce gold bar
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.760]   that is allocated to some contractor,
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.920]   400 ounces worth of gold allocated to a contract.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.240]   And so essentially you're buying
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.160]   right to the exposure of that bar.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.400]   People actually enacting physicals
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   and like converting contracts
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.580]   and waiting till expiry is a little bit rare,
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.720]   but I have seen particular instances
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.480]   where contracts need to be backed.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.880]   And so if you have an opportunity
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.840]   to play at a larger gold market,
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.920]   you can end up backing contracts
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.000]   when we call it like the EFP exchange or physical
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.520]   gets like into a negative zone.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.600]   So where the ETF price is actually higher
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.800]   than the physical price.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.640]   There's like a certain amount of arbitrage
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.440]   where if you have physical gold
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.680]   and you can back it in large quantity,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.440]   you can back these contracts
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.200]   and be able to help a retail investor
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.500]   be able to have that exposure.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.240]   So generally most of them are like semi-allocated.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.520]   So you're buying like the right
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.700]   to potential future exposure.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.840]   So it's like, it gets a little bit complicated.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.760]   But I mean, that's like do your own research
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.320]   on which GLD you're gonna buy
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.400]   or like what specific ETF you want to play in.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.440]   - So the reason we got connected
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.800]   is that in the last few weeks,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.440]   I've been just exploring this
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.160]   after going to a conference
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.240]   and listening to a talk about Costco gold.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.720]   So I came back and went to Costco.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.920]   I said, oh, there's this gold here.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.840]   And I think the thing that for me kicked it off
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.200]   was the U.S. Mint had this release
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.480]   of a 230th anniversary flowing hair coin.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.040]   I honestly have no clue what that means.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.480]   So I'm gonna ask you to explain it.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.000]   But I picked up a couple
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.040]   and it was almost like everyone knew in advance
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.060]   that if you could just go on the U.S. Mint website
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.120]   and buy this at 9 a.m. Pacific, you would make money.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   And sure enough, that was the case.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.640]   Talk a little bit about that
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.800]   and how there are opportunities for regular consumers
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.000]   to invest and make money in gold.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.320]   - Yeah, so we've been planting seeds
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.360]   for quite some time on this flowing hair gold coin,
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.640]   like probably a year in advance.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.240]   Like this is something that we knew
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.640]   was gonna be good from the start.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.840]   And it ended up being not as good as I thought,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.960]   but still quite well for the people I think got involved.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.160]   But essentially, the U.S. Mint makes commemorative coins.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.480]   And so they try to commemorate some event in U.S. history,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.000]   which happened to be the Flowing Hair Silver Dollar,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.560]   which is our first silver dollar in the U.S.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.960]   And they actually did a really good job
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.440]   on the rendition of it.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.920]   I don't know why they picked a 230th anniversary.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.840]   It seems kind of arbitrary.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.440]   But the original silver dollar
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.240]   is a little bit larger of a size
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.440]   and it has edge lettering.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.200]   But the $17.94 is one of the most expensive U.S. coins
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.640]   that you could possibly have.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.440]   I think one recently sold for like $10 million.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.880]   Yeah, so it's a very like esteemed coin
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.160]   in the coin industry.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.640]   Like everyone knows that that's a really great coin.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.080]   So when the U.S. Mint decided
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.560]   that they were gonna put that on the product schedule,
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.360]   we immediately knew like that's gonna be like really good.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.200]   And it kind of started with the silver medal.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   I don't know if you'd bought the silver medal prior to.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.240]   - I didn't.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.600]   - Yeah, so they've made a silver counterpart
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.520]   which they had basically created this like lottery out of.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.000]   And the Mint's been doing a great job
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.720]   on making consumer coin releases like limited drops.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.280]   They've basically taken the Supreme model
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.680]   and made it for the U.S. Mint, which is amazing.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.280]   Old like boomer collector people hate it.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.120]   Like they hate the Mint doing that.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.920]   But I think that it's the best way to get people into coins.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.600]   'Cause obviously now we're talking about it.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.960]   It makes no sense that we would be talking about
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.000]   a limited coin release unless it was like,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.560]   you know, it's sold out and there was a resale market
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.000]   and there was all this like hype generated around it.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.280]   But the silver medal had this like privy mark,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.760]   which is something that the Mint has done in the past.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.080]   And they basically randomly put in 1794
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.840]   of these privy marked coins into the 50,000 that they sold.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.280]   Those privy marked coins are worth like four grand now.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.120]   The retail was a hundred dollars.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.520]   So some people became instantly like, you know,
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.400]   could pay their rent, could pay groceries for like a year.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.240]   Like they had all of this like excess, you know,
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.200]   consumer surplus from buying this coin for a hundred dollars.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.320]   So I think people got really excited about the gold one.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.960]   The sad part is they didn't do a privy for the gold.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.200]   They're actually auctioning them
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.520]   and they're going for ridiculous prices right now.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.120]   But the gold ended up doing very well
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.680]   'cause the design is just, you know, good.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.520]   Like it's just hands down, like a very nice design.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.160]   Like, you know, a lot of coins we see come through
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.400]   the platform and when we got the first one in,
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.920]   we were like, wow.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.560]   Like that was kind of the reaction that we had.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.480]   And I think it's been a while since I've like
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.680]   actually liked a coin that the Mint has put out.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.560]   So the, I think, you know, maybe just some other people
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.600]   that are more familiar with coin releases,
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.840]   like they would call this one a dud
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.320]   in comparison to the other ones.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.360]   'Cause in 2020, which was like what I would consider
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   like peak coin market, they had released a privy gold eagle,
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.280]   proof gold eagle, and the retail was $2,000.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.880]   And that coin sells for like 20 grand
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.240]   in a perfect 70 now.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.200]   And they're very, very hard to come by.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   - But if you were relatively tech savvy
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.000]   sitting at your computer the day it launched,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.560]   would it have been easy to get one?
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   Like if you can buy like Amazon in two clicks, you're fine.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.080]   Like your competition is very low.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.760]   And I think a lot of numismatists
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.440]   that are interested in modern coins
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.960]   are likely not your most tech savvy people.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.040]   So it's a little bit difficult to have them
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.160]   go on and buy a coin.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.800]   So I think that's why they're probably upset
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.120]   that they had to buy them on the aftermarket.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.880]   But yeah, it's generally like, you know,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.800]   the process is like making an account,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.280]   it's putting your credit card info in,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.320]   waiting until the drop time,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.920]   and then just going to hit buy
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.120]   and then hope that the order goes through.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.840]   So I think it's pretty easy to be able to do that.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   - How often does the US Mint release something
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.160]   that is exciting?
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.280]   - I would say like generally once a year.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.480]   And it's kind of at the end of the year.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.000]   And some years you may get really lucky.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.360]   And like, for instance, 2020,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.840]   every single product that came out was good.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.000]   Like every single one for like eight releases in a row,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.840]   which just like--
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.400]   - And so they do multiple releases a year,
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.480]   but the hyped one that's exciting
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.320]   is towards the end of the year.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.880]   - They usually do, like they have their continuing series,
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.520]   and they'll release those every year.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.840]   And sometimes the continuing series can be like very good.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.880]   Like I said before, like Proof Gold
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.240]   can end up being like a very good release.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.200]   And generally that's because like, you know,
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.560]   just supply and demand, you know,
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.240]   the dealers want more supply to sell
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.640]   to their like, you know, retail customers.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.480]   And so they want to create a market for buying these.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.560]   But yeah, at the end of the year, around November,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.800]   there's always kind of one coin
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.760]   that catches everyone's eye.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.520]   And they didn't do it in 2022, which was kind of sad.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   So there was kind of like a lull period.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.200]   2020, 2021 were good.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.040]   2023 had a release that was like not as popular,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.360]   but still did well.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.040]   And then 2024, obviously the flowing hair coin.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.240]   So we don't really know what's going to come in next year
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.480]   until like maybe about a month from now.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.000]   And then I can kind of tell you like that one might be okay.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.360]   And then we kind of need to wait
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.920]   for a little bit more info.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.760]   But I mean, I had been writing about the flowing hair coin
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.280]   since like June, and I had had like, you know,
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.640]   mock-ups done and everything.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.600]   And then everyone started using that.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.640]   So I think it was, you know, really good for us
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.200]   to be able to be early on that information.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.600]   And then we also kind of got some,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.280]   a little bit of insider stuff
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.120]   just because we're a bulk supplier of the mint.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.840]   So we can see kind of a little bit before the public sees
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.160]   like what, you know, the mintage is going to be
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.720]   and like what that coin might actually look like and stuff.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.120]   And so I think it's always good to share that info
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.000]   as it comes out so people can kind of see like,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.160]   you know, what are they actually going to buy?
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.000]   And I think they didn't release the product images
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.520]   until like two days before or something.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.320]   So it was very strange release for this one.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.760]   - I don't think I got into this release
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.120]   until about two days before, so I missed the whole backstory.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.880]   - Yeah, there's quite a backstory.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.600]   And you know, obviously like, I mean,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.560]   our kind of drive is that, you know,
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.840]   we have to create a supply and demand
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.480]   for that specific item.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.640]   And obviously like, you know,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.440]   people can sell it on eBay or locally
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.640]   or all this other stuff.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.280]   But I think, you know,
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.920]   we were trying to take like a StockX approach to it.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.520]   And the fact that, you know,
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.320]   StockX would promote releases prior to when they come out
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.720]   ended up working quite well.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.960]   I mean, you know, kind of on par with eBay sales
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.040]   and, you know, hopefully trying to continue that.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.920]   So I think just having more outlets is also good.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.480]   - So what you've done with Pure, my experience,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.120]   I don't hold any shares, I have no equity here.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.280]   But you started basically, as I would describe it,
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.600]   as a marketplace for buying and selling gold
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.920]   that operates a bit more like an investment marketplace
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.680]   where there's a bid and an ask,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.200]   and you can see the order book.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.760]   But if I remember right, I could actually see,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.880]   I could actually sell my flowing hair coin
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.080]   before I even got it.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.600]   - Yeah, so when we originally started Pure,
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.040]   we were actually trying to tackle this like mint problem,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.000]   just 'cause we had bought and sold a lot of coins
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.160]   on the mint prior.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.000]   And there really isn't a lot of liquidity.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.400]   Like, you know, without Pure as it exists right now,
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.280]   like you could go on eBay and sell it,
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.960]   but then, you know, there's obviously complications
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.800]   with like what you're gonna do on eBay
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.500]   and a lot of people do well there.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   But we kind of started listing the Costco SKUs
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.800]   as like a ha-ha funny sort of thing,
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.480]   and it ended up working like quite well,
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.000]   because, you know, obviously people need liquidity
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.420]   for specific bars.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.480]   And I think the other thing was that
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.080]   we were able to tackle the premium problem really well,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.200]   'cause most people would just define
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.120]   the gold bars as just generic.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.440]   But, you know, the difference between a Fortuna and a Koi
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.760]   is actually, you know, like 15, 20 bucks.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.280]   And I think that kind of makes a difference
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.360]   to a lot of people,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.520]   considering that spot premium is like, you know,
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.760]   literally that.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   So, yeah, and then we had kind of gotten back
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.980]   to our original roots
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.060]   when we started doing the flowing hair coin.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:52.680]   And it was really cool to see how the market opened
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.440]   and we kind of just let people trade from the beginning.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.480]   And obviously like some people canceled,
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.000]   so like on the back end of things,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.200]   like we had a couple coins live
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.120]   to be able to make sure buyers were whole,
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.460]   just so we could like play around with the market.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.700]   But generally most people are, you know,
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.000]   pretty nice and like happen to, you know,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.400]   follow through on their things.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.480]   I obviously think, you know, our onboarding
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.280]   like kind of makes people like,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.760]   "Hey, I need to be able to fulfill this."
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.000]   But yeah, we just kind of let people trade
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.720]   as they would on it.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.800]   And just to see how it would go.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.640]   I know a lot of people started like pre-selling.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.080]   And so we didn't allow any pre-sales,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.720]   but right after the release,
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.080]   if you had a confirmed order,
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.480]   we were like, "Hey, like that's fine."
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.960]   So some people got canceled,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.600]   but you know, we made the buyers whole, so.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.520]   - Yeah.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.200]   And when it comes to Costco, since you mentioned it,
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.060]   this is kind of where I got into this a little bit.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.680]   You basically, Costco is selling gold bars at checkout,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.520]   more so on certain days of the week than others.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.200]   And there's a pretty active market for selling them.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.640]   So if you walk into a Costco, you could buy a gold bar
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.240]   and you could probably go on Pure and sell it
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.720]   before you even get to your car.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.960]   - Yeah, there is quite a lot of liquidity for Costco items.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.480]   I think to the fact that Costco may be selling more
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.080]   than they originally anticipated.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.040]   So they've in turn kind of created this like after market
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.840]   where people want to buy these bars
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.120]   and whether that be at Costco or not at Costco,
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.320]   people need them for different, I don't know,
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.780]   different sales activities or investment activities.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.320]   So they've really kind of put gold in this like mainstream.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.240]   I think, obviously a lot of news outlets have covered this,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.040]   like Costco gold is selling out in like 10 seconds.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.520]   But generally, you could just walk into a Costco,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.920]   I think they have like a product limit or something.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.880]   So you can't go in and buy like all of them,
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.440]   but you could get like five.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.960]   And the prices are quite good.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.520]   Like I'm pretty sure they're selling them at a loss.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.520]   Like, we get the pretty similar distribution from HAMP
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.880]   and the cost per bar is like quite high.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.160]   So I'm sure that, obviously they have like
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.840]   whatever special deal that they're running,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.520]   but it seems like it's like another like chicken baker,
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.960]   like hotdog situation.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.320]   But instead it's like a $2,800 gold bar
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.040]   that they're able to push.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.960]   But I think generally for like our community,
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.200]   it's been quite good 'cause prior to this,
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   you would have like shady investment quote unquote,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.320]   gold firms call you up and be like,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.560]   "Hey, do you wanna liquidate your retirement account
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.400]   "into this?"
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.320]   And people are like, "Oh, that's horrible."
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.560]   So I think Costco created a really good entry market
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.280]   for people who are curious.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.960]   And it's a familiar storm.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.200]   - And I think if you look at the price
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.760]   you're gonna pay in Costco,
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.960]   and you look at the price you can sell on Pure,
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.640]   and this is something I've been monitoring closely.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:12.560]   Just to be clear, if you go buy your Costco gold bar
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.560]   with U.S. dollar cash,
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.000]   you're not putting it on a credit card,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.200]   you're not a Costco executive rewards member
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.680]   getting 2% back.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.640]   You're just looking at what's the retail price
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.880]   for Costco gold,
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.200]   which in most states is not subject to sales tax.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.360]   And then you look at the Pure price
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.560]   that you can sell it at and let's net out the fee.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.640]   You guys charge a fee that's very reasonable,
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.120]   I think for a Costco gold bar, it's like 0.75%.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.400]   And if you did a lot of volume, it would come down.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.640]   And you're not gonna make money on most days.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.120]   But Costco's executive rewards program,
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.440]   if you have the $130 membership
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.200]   instead of the $65 membership,
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.640]   you get 2% back on all your spending at Costco.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.960]   And from watching the prices the last, I don't know,
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.160]   month or two, just personally,
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.600]   the Delta is usually within that 2% band.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.120]   And so if you buy a gold bar at Costco
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.560]   and you turned around and sold it right away,
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.920]   that 2% Costco executive rewards
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.320]   that you pay $130 a year for,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.040]   will close the gap on any amount
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.800]   that you might lose selling it.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.600]   And then added bonus,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.160]   Costco will let you pay with cash,
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.880]   with a debit card or a credit card.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.760]   And so you get those rewards as well.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.680]   But I think if you just forget the credit card rewards
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.560]   for a second, there's actually a profitable
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.680]   buying and selling gold.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.480]   And then the credit card rewards would be a bonus.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.880]   - Yeah, I think we've created a lot of tools
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:41.400]   like in our passing time to be able to kind of help people
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.800]   understand like where the price point lies
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.520]   compared to like what the active market is.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.560]   And, you know, there are opportunities
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.720]   where it's just like mispriced, you know,
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.640]   like you go in and it's like $100 below where it should be.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.040]   - And that's the case with these gold buffalos.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.880]   - Yeah.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.880]   - When I was looking on Costco's website,
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.360]   I joined a couple slacks then discords
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.400]   where there were Costco gold notifications
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.680]   and one popped up and said, "These buffalos are available."
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.240]   And I went in and I went and ordered five of them.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.520]   And then I looked at Pure at the same time.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.200]   And I was like, the price I paid at Costco was less
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.480]   than the price I could sell them for in a moment.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.320]   Not factoring in executive rewards,
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.280]   not factoring in credit card rewards,
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.160]   I actually made money buying this coin from Costco
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.000]   and selling it.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.880]   - Yeah, and I think it's kind of created a drop ability
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.800]   like to these releases, like people are kind of,
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.200]   you know, waiting and waiting for restocks.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.120]   And it just reminds me of like,
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.080]   kind of like the sneaker era of like all the stuff
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.480]   where people were buying Yeezys and things like that.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.120]   So I think it's kind of cool to see that that's came alive
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.200]   in like a different market.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.480]   And obviously, you know, I mean,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.120]   Costco makes a lot of money in other sectors.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.320]   And I think that their kind of play,
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.240]   like obviously I don't know this for a fact,
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.360]   but their play is just, you know, volume,
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.600]   like how much can they sell?
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.760]   Being able to do like hundreds of millions
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.200]   worth of gold a month.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.960]   Like they've got to be like, you know,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.200]   top three in the industry now
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.760]   for how much sales they're doing.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.120]   Like it's quite a lot.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.160]   And they've kind of came onto the scene
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.520]   in a different and larger way than most other people.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.920]   But there are some people kind of breaking into Walmart now.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.760]   So that's good.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.520]   - Yeah, I have seen that Walmart also sells gold,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.800]   but not as competitive as a price as Costco.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.400]   - Definitely not as competitive,
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.640]   but Walmart's model is a little more different
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.320]   than Costco's model.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.720]   Obviously Walmart doesn't sell gold in store
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.440]   and Walmart's more of like, you know,
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.760]   online marketplace than anything.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.720]   Taking cards on gold is like an incredibly risky area.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.440]   You know, you have one person charge back
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.560]   and it's like a whole nightmare.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.600]   So I think, you know, from our perspective,
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.760]   like we tend to stay away from that area
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.120]   'cause a lot of people have asked us,
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.320]   why don't you just open Pure to add cards?
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.600]   And I'm just like,
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.000]   I don't wanna deal with that headache right now.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.640]   But, you know, in larger scale like Costco, Walmart,
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.240]   like they kind of have that figured out already.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.720]   And so they're able to kind of offer that,
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.840]   like, you know, rewards to having it.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.760]   - And I haven't looked into this,
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.600]   but I wanna do another episode on gift card reselling,
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.520]   because I actually think there's an interesting market there
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.640]   to similarly buy gift cards that are on sale at a discount.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.400]   And then, you know, there are places to resell them online.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.480]   And that can also be a profitable business.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.080]   But I often see Walmart gift cards at a pretty big discount.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.160]   And by pretty big, I mean like 10, 12, 15%.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.240]   And now it has me thinking,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.000]   well, if you can buy Walmart gift cards at 15% off
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.960]   and use them to buy gold, could you get a discount on gold?
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.160]   - I think that's the loop.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.040]   If I were to, you know,
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.440]   place a bet on why people would be buying gold at Walmart,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.360]   I would say that that's the reason why, so.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.840]   - Yeah, and just to be clear,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.320]   some of these things might sound
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.140]   like it's all about credit cards,
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.920]   but buying a lot of these discounted gift cards at scale
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.980]   is actually something where you have to pay a fee
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.820]   to use a credit card.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.640]   So when I look at a lot of these things,
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.760]   this is not a credit card points play
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.600]   for buying Walmart gift cards.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.400]   It's actually a discounted gift card and gold price play
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.500]   that's independent of credit card rewards.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.680]   That said, you know, I think for some people,
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.180]   the credit card rewards would be a compelling thing,
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:32.180]   but I actually view both gift cards and gold,
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.280]   and potentially some buying group stuff
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.680]   that I won't even get to now,
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.600]   as opportunities to find mispriced items
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.720]   at programs where either their currency,
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.960]   i.e. gift card is sold at a discount,
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.520]   or their membership includes a 2% discount,
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.200]   which full disclosure for everyone,
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.700]   is capped at $62,500 a year.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.440]   So, you know, you can't go spend a million dollars on gold.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.880]   - They figured out their loss for it.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.140]   - Yeah, yeah, they have.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.900]   One thing for people who are, maybe go to Costco,
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.140]   maybe pick up a few bars and wanna sell them,
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:07.440]   and go to Pure, help alleviate some concern they might have
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.220]   with what happens next,
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.420]   because presumably they've spent a ton of money, right?
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.860]   If you bought five bars, you're over 10 grand,
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.860]   and you're probably gonna say,
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.740]   "Here's a mailing label, can you send it in the mail?"
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.220]   How do people think about that aspect?
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.020]   - I think the biggest thing that we've been able to do
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.600]   is obviously everything's open under camera,
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.520]   so we'll have reports of everything as it comes in.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.480]   We keep allocated storage of people's orders,
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.480]   which I think is another big thing.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.160]   People always ask if a package was tampered or lost,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.480]   is it insured?
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.760]   And we have insurance on all packages.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.720]   We're using overnight or express mail
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.120]   to be able to make sure it's all good.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   I think a lot of people could probably take a packing lesson,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.300]   so we may produce some videos on that,
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.940]   and be able to say this is the way
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.420]   to properly pack your items,
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.300]   'cause I think most people think about Amazon returns
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.260]   as their only other comparison
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.740]   to when they actually go out to ship stuff,
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.420]   and sending $13,000 in an Amazon box,
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.920]   or a Chewy box, or some Huggies diaper box
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.320]   is probably a bad idea.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   Every now and then, there'll be some strange stuff,
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.680]   so I think we've gotten down that route
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.000]   of how scary can someone package
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.920]   their really expensive items?
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.280]   But I think one thing is being able to lock
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.840]   the price of the item.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.400]   I think that's a big win for the service that we offer,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.440]   is being able to give you the peace of mind
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.660]   that when you actually sell those items,
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.060]   that price is frozen.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.060]   I think sometimes people get confused.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.940]   If it goes down, then they are making money,
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.260]   but either a positive or negative loss,
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.140]   you're kind of on the hook if you don't fulfill those items.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.940]   - Does that mean that, let's say I sold my flowing hair coin
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.660]   at $4,200, and two days later,
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.860]   before I even shipped it out, or maybe a day later,
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.740]   it's at $4,300, and I cancel.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.040]   Am I on the hook for that spread?
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.660]   - Yeah, you would be on the hook for the spread
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.980]   at that point, because there's a buyer on the other end,
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.980]   we have to make sure that buyer's whole.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.400]   So we would call that the market loss.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.380]   So if you sell your flowing hair,
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.940]   and it goes up to $10,000, and you decide to cancel,
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.620]   yeah, that spread's gonna be quite large.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:41.780]   Obviously, we kind of determine fair market value
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.340]   on a fair spread.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.180]   We're not gonna just pump the prices up
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.040]   to make it look like there's a larger market loss.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.900]   But yeah, generally, I think the biggest concerns
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.860]   come with shipping, receipt, and payment.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.140]   And I think one thing that we're trying not to be able to do
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.340]   is be people's bank.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.900]   That's something that I think Pure
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.660]   is trying to actively avoid.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.060]   I think some people are trying to use Pure
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:13.060]   as a way to cash in gold in large quantity
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.940]   to be able to turn credit card points.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.980]   Obviously, some people do high volume,
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.800]   but we kind of moderate accounts as they go.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.500]   So if you're selling here and there, it's a good activity,
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.500]   but we keep a lot of close eyes on how people's activity
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   are trading over time, how do they have a business set up.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.300]   At the end of the year, what coins have they sold?
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.740]   Are those coins falling under 1099s?
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.860]   There's a lot of different aspects
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.240]   that go on behind the scenes.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.260]   So I think, obviously, people should be aware
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.020]   of all of these when they're buying them
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.260]   and kind of understand all the different
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.100]   tax implications that have it.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.040]   Call your CPA, make sure that what you're doing is fine.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.260]   If you're selling it for a loss,
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.460]   make sure you're taking that loss at the end of the year
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.620]   to be able to write it off.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.740]   So there's a lot of different things
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.980]   that you should probably consider
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.060]   before entering this market.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.260]   - And then, obviously, there's definitely a lot
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.900]   of money laundering and fraud risk within the gold market.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.220]   And so, from our perspective, we treat everyone
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:28.140]   as if we give them the blank slate to begin with.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.780]   You go through identity, you go through a bank account check,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.220]   and if you don't pass that, then too bad.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.900]   We're not gonna be able to take them as a customer.
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   - Yeah, I've seen everything from a guy on WhatsApp
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.300]   that you can message and sell gold to that says,
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.020]   "I don't do 1099s, I don't do ID verification,"
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.180]   to a reputable person who runs a company
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.380]   but maybe doesn't have as big of an operation as you
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.420]   and maybe does do an ID check but might not do 1099s,
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.020]   all the way to you are trying to do this
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.860]   as by-the-book as possible.
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.900]   So I think there are a lot of options out there.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.220]   If I could just hand these to you, I would.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.260]   I'd save me some shipping, but I'm gonna ship 'em off
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.880]   'cause I want the experience of packing them up
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.720]   and shipping them off.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.280]   But there are all the degrees of places
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.780]   that you can buy and sell from,
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   and everyone has to choose what's right for them.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.860]   But I did an episode on taxes with a woman
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.480]   who after that episode released as a follow-up a video
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.340]   about the taxation of credit card rewards and stuff.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.220]   And I'm trying to do things legally.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.220]   I'm not trying to skirt any corners.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.940]   I'm trying to do all the things correctly.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.260]   And so the fact that you guys are trying to do
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:43.080]   as much of that as possible feels like a good place for me.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:43.920]   - Yeah.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.080]   - Might not be a good place for everyone else,
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.120]   but I like to do things by the book.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.200]   - Yeah, and I think we're still figuring out
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.360]   a lot of the logistics of how to handle
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.320]   a lot of operations as well as the financial operations
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.760]   and stuff.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.320]   I mean, our company is a little bit over a year old,
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.900]   and we've been working on our own playbook, I guess,
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:10.520]   for this market because no one has really experienced
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.460]   the growth that we've had in this short amount of time.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.520]   And obviously this has been propelled by Costco.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.200]   We just built out a new vault.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.360]   There's another whole aspect to the operations side
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.200]   of things.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.800]   And so the biggest thing for me is I like to be able
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.160]   to slow things down, go through them methodically,
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.560]   understand how to do everything in the right way.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.860]   And we err on the side of precaution.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:40.180]   So if there's an issue with a bank account
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.060]   getting disconnected, we're gonna reach out to that person.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.820]   If there's an issue with something getting tampered,
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.140]   we're gonna reach out to that person,
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.280]   and we're gonna provide as much information as we can.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.340]   So we understand the perspective
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.380]   of what people are trying to do.
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:01.020]   But generally, the Costco segment of customers
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.260]   is like one part of our business,
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.740]   and we're happy to serve those.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.100]   But we also have a whole other side of the coin people,
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.900]   the dealers, the shops, and all this other stuff.
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.860]   And the way that the two sectors do business
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.300]   is very, very different.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.820]   The expectations are much different.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:24.820]   The ability to reconcile transactions is much different.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.120]   So I think being able to cater to both markets
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.960]   is something that we're learning to be able to do.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:36.200]   But yeah, I have to keep my mind in two different areas
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.320]   when talking to different types of customers.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.800]   - Let's jump to the other side.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.120]   But first, real quick,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.600]   I'll put a link in the show notes to Pure.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.840]   Is there anything, if we put that link in,
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.840]   that someone might get?
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.960]   - Yeah, so we have a referral program,
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.800]   so hopefully we can set something up.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   - Yeah, so whatever you come up with,
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.000]   I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.580]   But one of the things that I've been thinking about
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.080]   is that other side of the market
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:05.920]   is people whose family has gold.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.480]   Whether those are old coins or even jewelry,
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.520]   where's the market for that?
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.400]   And I know that might not be something on the jewelry side
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.980]   that you guys participate in,
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.000]   but what advice would you give to someone
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.920]   who finds out that their grandparents or their parents
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.360]   have various kinds of gold
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.160]   and don't wanna get taken advantage of?
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.880]   - I always tell people that if they're not comfortable
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.000]   with going somewhere online,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.640]   then go to your local coin shop.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.400]   And I'm gonna shout out all the local coin shops here
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:39.400]   because I'm still a big fan of the in-person business.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.080]   I think if you find a collection
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.540]   or you have a collection that's passed down,
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.840]   generally, on the off chance
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.160]   that there's something quite valuable,
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.440]   a local coin shop could tell you very quickly.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.360]   I think the general stance is that
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.600]   doing research on Google and stuff
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.280]   is probably gonna lead you in the bad way.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.520]   So I think the quickest and easiest search
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.600]   is just local coin shop.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.200]   And then just go to whatever one has the best reviews.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   And so if you're able to decipher what items are what,
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.160]   then I think that Pure is probably a great place to go
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.480]   because then you can find your items very quickly.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.800]   We're happy to help you if you send us photos.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.440]   But there's a network of really good coin dealers
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:34.040]   and shops out there that are a part of the P&G.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.600]   That's essentially the Professional Numismatic Guild,
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.920]   and they're all very reputable.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.200]   They have a coat of honor.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.080]   It's very difficult to get in.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.120]   It's something that should be very prestigious
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.640]   to someone who's around that.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.200]   And even in the Bay Area, there's multiple P&G dealers.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.600]   And most of the shops we work with are on a certain level.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.240]   So I'm happy to point someone to a shop
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.560]   if they're not comfortable with doing online experience.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.560]   And I do think there is something tangible
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.320]   to going in and being able to actually hear someone out
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.160]   and look at other items and understand the pricing.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   I think it's a very good educational experience.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.160]   - What about the, I was walking downtown the other day
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.480]   and I saw this giant We Buy Gold banner.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.840]   Is that like a thing that should deter people?
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.120]   - I think that's like the worst possible place to go.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.560]   I would compare the We Buy Gold
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.000]   to like the like check cashing places.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.920]   Like, you know, they'll give you your payday
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.520]   like two weeks in advance.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.200]   - Like at like 1,000% interest.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   - Yeah, you're gonna get pretty raked going through that.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.040]   - So a lot of these coin stores in the P&G group,
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.240]   you probably can't show up there
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.000]   with a bunch of gold jewelry, right?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.520]   They're dealing in coins.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.120]   - I've worked in shops before
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.360]   and generally most shops also act as a jewelry shop
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.600]   and they probably have a pawnbroker license
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.360]   and they will buy scrap gold.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.240]   But I think people expect a lot out of scrap gold.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.400]   Obviously this isn't something you can sell on pure.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.080]   Like we only take like assayed and marked gold.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.160]   We're not gonna take jewelry.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.280]   There's like way, way too much risk
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.520]   and like where it's from, what it's going on.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.880]   So I think, you know, the protocols in a shop
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.620]   are probably the best place to go for jewelry.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.680]   And generally they're fairly, you know,
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.240]   pretty good about like being on, you know,
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.040]   payment and as well as like, you know,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.600]   giving you a fair price
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.120]   and giving you an assay for them and stuff.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.440]   So, and they may even pay you more for stones.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.840]   You know, like if you have nice like stones
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.160]   within the jewelry, I think that's also a win.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.360]   Like they kind of act as a jewelry store as well.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.700]   And that kind of keeps them in business
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.920]   when the coin industry is not like, you know,
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.960]   super hot like it is now, so.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.220]   - Well, I wouldn't have thought that.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.520]   So I'm glad you said it.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.560]   I know that there are gonna be some people
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.280]   over the holidays find out their family
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.720]   has collections of gold or coins
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.840]   and with prices the way they've been the last year,
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.880]   I feel like people are probably gonna wanna figure out
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.720]   what that's worth.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.680]   And so going to a reputable coin shop, great suggestion.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.160]   Where online would you send people
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.200]   to learn more about all of this?
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.920]   - One of them is PCGS coin facts.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.840]   That will basically give you,
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.480]   it's like a massive database
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.120]   of every US and world coin possible.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.480]   For pricing, I always look at auctions.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.800]   So like heritage auctions, Stacks Bowers galleries,
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.360]   those are kind of the big ones.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.320]   And then just for like general information
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.280]   about how to become a numismatist
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.600]   is like the ANA is money.org.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.680]   And that's kind of an organization
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.800]   that all numismatists should support at some point.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.760]   And like, I'm a lifetime member,
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.720]   a lot of other people are lifetime members
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.240]   and there's not a lot of new members coming in,
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.560]   but I always think that that's good.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.680]   And then obviously like, go to a coin show,
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.080]   go to a local coin shop or go to your local coin club.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.440]   Like you'll learn a lot.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.640]   It may be boring for some people,
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.000]   but other people might find it to be very cool.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.480]   And you might meet a lot of interesting people
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.400]   from the bullion sector
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.480]   that have crossed over into this coin world.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.400]   And maybe you'll be able to make money
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.800]   in the coin world too.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.480]   - Do you think like garage sales and estate sales
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.320]   are places to--
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.360]   - I think that those have already been fairly picked over.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.560]   But I think that generally the best place to find coins
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.600]   is just a coin show.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.200]   - All right, this has been awesome.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.880]   Any parting words for someone
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.040]   trying to get into the gold thing,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.080]   things to avoid and common mistakes?
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.040]   - I would just avoid anyone who says the words
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:47.760]   tangible wealth or I hate the word safe haven.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.840]   That's like a red flag to me.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.240]   If someone calls it a safe haven,
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.520]   you should probably look the other way.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:59.080]   Anyone who's like fear mongering, like bad idea.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.880]   Like you want to be able to figure out
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.960]   who's being transparent about their activities
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.040]   and kind of telling you what they're gonna make
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:08.880]   as well as you.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.920]   So people get taken advantage of a lot.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.960]   So just keep your red flags up and just keep it going.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.800]   - Perfect.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.560]   All right, thank you so much for being here.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.160]   And I'll send everyone links, collectpure.com.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.000]   - Sweet.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:21.960]   - Awesome.
