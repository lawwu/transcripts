[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   [Music]
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.380]   Good Friday morning. Thanks for listening.
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.280]   Well, as most of you know, maturing in our Bible knowledge
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.080]   means facing the hardest questions that the Bible raises.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.520]   And on the podcast, we're working through three of those hard questions
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.760]   prompted by your readings in the first two chapters of 2 Thessalonians.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.320]   Namely, is God present or is He absent in His eternal judgment?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.240]   2 Thessalonians 1.9 seems to say that He's absent.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.160]   We addressed that question in APJ 18.01.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.240]   Then many of you have asked about the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.000]   Who is that? That was a week ago in APJ 18.03.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440]   And now finally, the third question, one about God sending strong delusions into the world.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160]   Does He still do that today? If so, how so? And what does it mean?
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600]   That's a question raised by 2 Thessalonians 2.11.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.840]   That one is on the table today.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.800]   Pastor John, on Monday in that man of lawlessness episode in APJ 18.03,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.480]   you read our text for today, 2 Thessalonians 2.11,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.480]   that God "sends them a strong delusion so that they might believe what is false."
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.680]   We've never addressed this text on APJ, but it has been asked several times,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.920]   particularly from two listeners. Deborah asks it this way, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.360]   Can you explain God's providential work in 2 Thessalonians 2.11 and His sending of a strong delusion
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.560]   on those who do not love or obey the truth? I stumble over this text. Thank you."
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.280]   And David writes in to ask it this way, "Hello, Pastor John. Can a professing nominal Christian
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.440]   who doesn't think they're saved ask God for them to be able to love the truth
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.640]   when they've previously not embraced it in faith?
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.320]   Or would such a one be given to strong delusions like we read about in 2 Thessalonians 2.11?
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.880]   In fact, what does that phrase even mean?"
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.960]   So, both Deborah and David are asking about the meaning of God's
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.840]   sending a "strong delusion"
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.880]   on people at the end of the age in connection with the man of lawlessness
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.480]   and the great deception that Satan worked through him just before the Lord's coming.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.960]   And David, more specifically, is asking about whether a person in the midst of this kind of deception
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.280]   can cry out to God with any hope of acceptance that God would enable him
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.880]   to love the truth when in previous times he's deformed it.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.600]   So, let's get the text in front of us. It really is a sobering text,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:48.480]   and in some ways a surprising one in the way it talks about deception and truth and pleasure.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.320]   At least I've learned a lot about the nature of saving faith and the nature of deception in this text.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.600]   So, here's a few verses. This is verses 9 through 12 of 2 Thessalonians 2.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.280]   The coming of the lawless one, that would be the final manifestation of Antichrist
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.720]   just before the return of Christ. The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:24.560]   with all power and lying signs and wonders and with all deception of unrighteousness.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   Now, that's not yet the strong delusion from God, but rather the deception from the lawless one.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.200]   Okay, so we haven't even got yet to God's kicking in with deception.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.280]   Here you have the satanic deception for those who are perishing because,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.960]   that's important because this is happening before God's strong delusion,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.520]   deceived because they did not welcome the love of the truth in order to be saved.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:06.000]   Therefore, and that's crucial, therefore God sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.920]   what is false in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.240]   Now, let's see if we can put some of these pieces together.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:29.200]   It's true that there are passages in the Bible that ascribe to God the right and the power
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.240]   to decide from eternity who will believe and who will not.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.600]   But this is not one of those passages.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:49.920]   This passage only traces unbelief back to the resistance of the human heart to welcome a love for the truth.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.520]   Now, that's a strange phrase, "welcome a love for the truth," but it's a literal translation.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:07.040]   Verse 10 says they are perishing because they did not welcome a love or the love of the truth in order to be saved.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:16.160]   In other words, this is a worse indictment than saying they did not welcome the truth in order to be saved.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.400]   They were not just resistant to the truth.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.680]   They were resistant to a love for the truth.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.400]   This is a love issue in the human heart.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.760]   They didn't want truth in their head.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   They didn't want love for truth in their heart.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.960]   They were totally resistant.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:43.520]   It reminds us of Ephesians 4, 18, where Paul traces unbelief down, down, down to the bottom
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.080]   of the human problem, which is not ignorance, he says, but hardness.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.360]   This is what verse 18 of Ephesians 4 says.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:10.400]   the ignorance that is in them, and then he goes deeper, due to the hardness of heart.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   So here in 2 Thessalonians, Paul is describing that hardness as a refusal to welcome a love for the truth.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:30.080]   It's as if love for truth is being offered and the human heart says, "No, no, not only do I not want truth,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.640]   I do not want to love the truth.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.400]   I don't want truth in my mind.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.520]   I don't want love in my heart."
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:46.720]   And that condition, that deep resistance to truth, to God, to gospel, to reality, and
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.840]   to love for truth and love for the gospel and love for God, that resistance is described
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.760]   as the reason for both Satan's deceiving and God's deluding.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:10.480]   It says Satan, in the form of this lawless one, comes with "deception of unrighteousness
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.720]   for the perishing," and then it says "because," because they refuse to love the truth.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:24.160]   And verse 11 says God sends a strong delusion because they refuse to love the truth.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.960]   So Paul doesn't explain how God does this, that is, how he sends this delusion.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:40.160]   It may well be that God does it by means of removing all the barriers to that satanic deception.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:49.440]   There are many places in the Bible where God governs the acts of unrighteous men and demons
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.240]   in order to achieve his righteous purposes.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.560]   So this is not unusual.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   It's as if God would say, "Okay, if you want to love falsehood and love unrighteousness
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.280]   instead of loving the truth, I'll see to it that your delusion is overpowering."
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:20.160]   In other words, God gives them up to their own mind, just like Paul says in Romans 1:28.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.520]   He says, "Since they did not approve of having God in their knowledge," that's so close to
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.440]   what 2 Thessalonians is saying.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.880]   They refuse to love for the truth.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.080]   They don't want God in their knowledge.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.760]   They don't want to love God.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.840]   Therefore, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   That would be a great delusion.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:50.480]   So their deception comes not only as their crime, but also as their punishment for the
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.840]   crime.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.080]   I said a minute ago that this text is surprising to me in the way it talks about deception
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   and truth and pleasure.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:08.160]   Looking at this idea of pleasure helps get at David's question, his other question that
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.800]   we haven't touched on yet, about whether we can pray to God to deliver us from deception
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.240]   and delusion when up till now we haven't welcomed the love of the truth.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.000]   We've been resistant to it.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.880]   Are we hopeless?
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:29.920]   What's surprising is the way pleasure figures into this text.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:38.400]   Verse 12 says that the reason people are condemned is because they "did not believe the truth,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.160]   but instead had pleasure in unrighteousness."
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.840]   What an interesting contrast.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.240]   Believing versus pleasure.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.740]   Hmm.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.040]   These are full of implications.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:59.280]   Back in verse 10, their deception is called "deception of unrighteousness."
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.960]   So I put it together like this.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:08.800]   Their unwillingness to welcome a love for the truth was owing to their love for, that
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.840]   is, their pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.200]   I love it.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.480]   I love it.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.400]   I find pleasure in it.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   This was their most basic condition, deep, deep heart love, heart delight, heart pleasure
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.080]   in unrighteousness.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:35.600]   And since the truth stands over against unrighteousness, that more basic love for unrighteousness prevented
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.360]   them from loving the truth.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:46.080]   So at the root of our human condition is a strong pleasure in sin, strong preference,
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.320]   gladness, delight.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.240]   Oh, how delectable is selfishness and self-exaltation and pride.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:02.960]   Sin feels good at the depth of our being, and that pleasure in unrighteousness prevents
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:13.600]   a welcome of a love for the truth and surprisingly prevents belief in the truth, as he says in
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.640]   verse 12.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.000]   So here's David's question.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.080]   Can a person pray in that condition?
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:25.280]   Can a person pray for deliverance from deceptive bondage to pleasure in unrighteousness, which
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.680]   prevents love for the truth and belief in the truth?
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.040]   And my answer is yes.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:41.600]   In fact, the bondage is so great that God is the only one who can cause a reversal of
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.120]   this dreadful bondage.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.040]   That's what has to happen.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:52.720]   And so that's how we ought to cry out in desperation for God to act in our lives and in the lives
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.440]   of those we love who are blind to this.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.360]   Remember, in the book of Lamentations, oh my goodness, this is encouraging.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.160]   Lamentations, the most horrible book in the Bible in one sense because of the descriptions
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.200]   of the devastation of the apple of God's eye, Jerusalem.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:18.000]   It says in chapter 4 verse 11, "The Lord has afflicted Jerusalem for the multitude of her
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.560]   transgression."
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.400]   So you would think this is hopeless.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.480]   She's under judgment.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.280]   But here's how the book ends.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.080]   The book ends.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:34.640]   Lamentations 5, 21, "Cause us to return, O Lord, that we may return."
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.160]   What a prayer.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.840]   What a prayer.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.160]   That's the same way people pray in Jeremiah 31, 18, "Cause me to return and I will return."
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.880]   Same thing in Psalm 80 verse 3, "Cause us to return, O God."
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.640]   Ultimately, I don't think it matters whether Satan is deceiving or God is deluding.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.920]   It's not hopeless to cry out, "Oh God, I cannot change my heart.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.720]   It's hard.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.880]   It's lifeless.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.520]   It's cold.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.480]   And it takes pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.240]   Oh God, do anything.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.840]   Do whatever you have to do to take out my heart of stone.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.040]   Cause my heart to find pleasure in your truth, your gospel, yourself.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.480]   If you don't do it, O God, I am undone."
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.640]   I don't think that's a hopeless prayer.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.720]   Yeah, not a hopeless prayer at all.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.800]   Thank you, Pastor John and Deborah and David.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.200]   Thank you for the excellent Bible questions.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.360]   We love to get Bible questions, even hard ones.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.240]   Send those to us.

[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.040]   Well, what's the key to knowing and doing the will of God in our lives?
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.240]   That's always a great question.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.920]   It's always a question that we get in the inbox.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.800]   It's always relevant.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.880]   And so we're going to address it again when we return on Monday.
