[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.940]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.320]   Today, we are discussing placebo effects.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.900]   We will also be discussing what are called nocebo effects,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.880]   as well as belief effects.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.920]   All three of these, placebo, nocebo, and belief effects,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.200]   are all related to our brain's incredible ability
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.240]   to place an expectation on what is about to happen
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.120]   and actually change what is about to happen
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.440]   independent of the physical and chemical properties
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.780]   of a drug or some sort of other treatment solution
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.480]   for things like pain, Parkinson's disease,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.120]   irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, stress,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.440]   and on and on and on.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.180]   Now, one of the most incredible things about these effects
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.240]   is that despite the fact that it would appear
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.120]   that they are simply psychological
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.120]   or the power of the mind over matter, it's not that at all.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.600]   Placebo, nocebo, and belief effects
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.460]   actually change the way your biology, your physiology works.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.960]   In fact, you have neural circuits within your brain
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800]   that are dedicated to how your expectation
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.320]   of what will happen actually changes
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.780]   some of the most core biological functions
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.080]   within your brain and body.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.320]   Modifying, for instance, heart rate, blood pressure,
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.580]   the release of specific neuromodulators
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.460]   such as dopamine and adrenaline.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.400]   And so powerfully so that these types of effects
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.120]   can actually work along with traditional drug treatments
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.320]   or behavioral treatments in order to vastly change
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.380]   the way that your brain and body work.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.000]   So if you think of the word placebo as an inert substance
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.340]   or treatment that is merely a control,
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520]   it's merely something introduced to an experiment
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.400]   or a clinical trial to try and figure out
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   what's happening normally in somebody's brain or body
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.040]   as a comparison to some drug or other type of treatment.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.840]   Well, while that can be true
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.080]   and placebo controls are vital for certain clinical studies,
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.000]   it's also the case that placebos, nocebos,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.720]   and belief effects have powerful impact on our physiology
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.640]   entirely separate from all of that.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.100]   So much so that several highly esteemed researchers
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.140]   in the medical community around the world
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.020]   believe that placebo, nocebo, and belief effects
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.900]   should actually be leveraged in the treatment
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.120]   of various diseases as their own unique treatment.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.760]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.660]   you're going to have a clear understanding
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.400]   of what placebo, nocebo, and belief effects are,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.060]   their biological underpinnings,
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.080]   and the way that you can leverage them
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.940]   toward your mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.420]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.180]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.100]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.920]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.960]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.400]   to the general public.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.520]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.360]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.500]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.140]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.080]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.100]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.040]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.880]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.560]   Now, one of the key things for getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.660]   is the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.440]   For instance, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.860]   your body temperature needs to drop
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.420]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.640]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.460]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.180]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.820]   With Eight Sleep, it makes it very easy
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.100]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.800]   You can dial in specific temperature ranges
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.180]   for the beginning, middle, and end of your night.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.380]   It even has a sleep tracker,
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.180]   so it will track your slow wave sleep, REM sleep,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.140]   total sleep, and give you a sleep score.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.120]   And you can actually divide the mattress
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.480]   into two different temperatures
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.620]   if someone else in your bed
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.280]   likes things a different temperature,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.320]   and they, of course, can have their sleep tracked
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.580]   independently of yours.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.100]   It's an absolutely wonderful tool.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.460]   It's completely transformed my sleep,
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.720]   so much so that when I travel to hotels or Airbnbs,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.860]   I find I don't ever sleep as well
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.180]   as when I have my Eight Sleep.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.580]   I've even shipped my Eight Sleep out to those places.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.600]   That gets a little complicated,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.220]   but that's how much I love my Eight Sleep.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.620]   It gives me the best possible night's sleep.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.780]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.740]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.980]   to save up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.620]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.140]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.220]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.160]   AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.260]   but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.940]   I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago,
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.980]   and I've been using one ever since.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.700]   AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler,
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   who was an engineer at Stanford.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.400]   And I knew of Alan because he had also built
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.300]   the so-called Aerobie Frisbee.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.180]   So he was sort of famous in our community
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.060]   for developing these different feats of engineering
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.900]   that turned into commercial products.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.980]   Now, I love coffee.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.140]   I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.460]   usually about 90 to 120 minutes
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.340]   after I wake up in the morning, although not always.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.940]   Sometimes if I'm going to exercise,
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.280]   I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.820]   But I love, love, love coffee.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.780]   And what I've personally found is that by using the AeroPress
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.680]   I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.520]   I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.200]   that allows the same beans to be prepared
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.440]   into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.280]   even the traditional French press.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.500]   The AeroPress is extremely easy to use,
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.420]   and it's extremely compact.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.440]   In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.800]   and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.960]   I'll just ask for some hot water
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.600]   and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.320]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.820]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.400]   If you would like to try AeroPress,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.800]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.640]   That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S.com/huberman
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.600]   to get 20% off any AeroPress coffee maker.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.680]   AeroPress ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.540]   and over 60 other countries in the world.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.340]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.300]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.940]   and different activities and your sleep patterns
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.340]   impact your health by giving you real-time feedback
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.080]   on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.340]   Now, blood glucose, sometimes referred to as blood sugar,
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.660]   has an immediate and long-term impact
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.820]   on your energy levels and your overall health.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.100]   One of the best ways to maintain focus and energy
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.180]   throughout your day, as well as to keep
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.280]   your so-called metabolic health in best order,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.020]   is to make sure that your blood glucose
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.660]   never spikes too much, nor does it get too low.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.040]   With Levels, you can monitor how different foods
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.140]   and food combinations impact your blood glucose levels
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.860]   on a moment-to-moment basis.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.920]   I've been using Levels for some time now,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.500]   and it's really helped me understand
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   which foods and food combinations, exercise schedules,
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.700]   and sleep schedules are optimal for my blood glucose levels
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.940]   and how that translates to energy levels
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.380]   and other metrics of health.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.300]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.380]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor,
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.820]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.220]   Levels has just launched a new CGM sensor
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.260]   that is smaller and has even better tracking than before.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.540]   Right now, they're also offering
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.000]   two free months of membership.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.720]   Again, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman,
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.800]   to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.000]   Okay, let's talk about placebo effects.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.240]   I will also be talking about nocebo effects,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.980]   and let's just establish the difference between those.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.140]   Placebo effects are when an inert substance
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.220]   or behavioral treatment that is a substance
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.980]   or behavioral treatment that is not going to have
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.780]   any kind of direct biological or psychological activity,
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.860]   right, it shouldn't do anything on its own,
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.900]   somehow does in the direction
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.860]   of improving symptoms or performance.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.820]   Now let's contrast that with nocebo.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.940]   Nocebo is when a drug or behavioral intervention
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.980]   which is inert, it should have no impact on symptoms
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.220]   or performance of any kind, but with nocebo,
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.180]   it turns out these substances or behavioral interventions
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.420]   actually worsen symptoms or performance.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.560]   Now, oftentimes people will just say a placebo effect.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.620]   It's a little bit more rare for people to distinguish
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.200]   between placebo and nocebo effects,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.400]   but I do think it's important to know their difference.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.460]   Going forward, I'll mostly just refer to these
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.420]   as placebo effects, but I'll talk about nocebo effects
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.420]   a little bit later.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.260]   I'll also talk about belief effects.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.480]   So let's just establish what belief effects are.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.540]   Belief effects are when you or somebody else
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.440]   learns specific knowledge that changes your expectation
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.500]   about what is going to happen in reference to say stress
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.180]   or consuming a given food or taking a given drug
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.100]   or doing a specific behavioral protocol
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.660]   and the specific information you learn or assimilate
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.780]   actually leads to that specific outcome.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.180]   So in many ways, belief effects and placebo effects
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.540]   are similar, it's just that the word placebo
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.060]   or placebo effects is commonly used to refer to drugs
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.380]   and behavioral interventions.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.860]   Belief effects are more specific language used to describe
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.100]   when information of any kind changes the outcome
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.980]   of some physiological or psychological process.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.940]   Now what's common to placebo, nocebo and belief effects
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.860]   is that they all work by changing expectation.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.020]   And anytime we talk about expectation,
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.480]   we're talking about the function of the nervous system
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.660]   and specifically the brain and specifically
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.940]   the prefrontal cortex within the brain.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.900]   The prefrontal cortex is neural real estate,
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.540]   which is just fancy nerd speak for the neurons
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.980]   and their connections that reside just behind your forehead,
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.940]   just in the front of your skull.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.040]   Now the prefrontal cortex has a lot of different
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.180]   subdivisions or regions.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.520]   The overall function of the prefrontal cortex
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.460]   can be described as having the ability to either activate
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.740]   or suppress other neural circuits deeper in the brain.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.260]   Some people, in fact, a previous guest
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.880]   on the Huberman Lab podcast, a neurosurgeon said,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.220]   "The prefrontal cortex can generally be described
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.420]   as the structure in the brain that controls other structures
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.900]   in the brain by saying shh or suppressing their function."
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.220]   So for instance, if you have the impulse to move
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.020]   or to shout, the prefrontal cortex suppresses that movement
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.980]   or suppresses that desire to shout or that shouting.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.180]   If you've ever had the experience of, you know,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.840]   going to the edge of a cliff or being on a high bridge
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.460]   and thinking, oh my goodness, like, you know,
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.880]   you just have this spontaneous thought,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.860]   which please don't do this in action,
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.780]   but one will have this thought like, oh my goodness,
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.920]   like what if I just jumped off?
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.080]   And people think, oh my goodness, you know,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.000]   do I have some sort of death wish?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.840]   Well, no.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.140]   The prefrontal cortex being largely a context evaluating
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.500]   and prediction machine is essentially looking
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.240]   at that landscape and predicting what would happen,
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.920]   indeed how bad it would be,
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.780]   if you were to jump off that bridge or jump off that cliff.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.480]   And then you feel that, oh my goodness,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.020]   like what's wrong with me, why would I think this?
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.680]   But the fact that you think it even for a moment,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.080]   but you don't do it and the fact that you recognize
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.240]   that it's sort of a, you know, a dangerous thought,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.980]   certainly a dangerous action, again,
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.660]   please don't engage in the action,
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.600]   tells you that your prefrontal cortex is working properly.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.300]   Again, the prefrontal cortex is involved
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.100]   in suppressing certain types of behaviors
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.440]   and what sorts of behaviors?
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.980]   Well, the larger theme of the prefrontal cortex
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.280]   that we need to consider today is that it is an expectation
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.940]   or prediction making machine.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.240]   It is a bunch of neurons that release chemicals
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.720]   and have electrical activity that are speaking with
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.280]   and receiving information from other areas of the brain.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.040]   And it's evaluating a number of things like context,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.520]   like what's going on in this room,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.920]   what's going on in this scene,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.160]   what's supposed to happen here, what might I do,
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.520]   what should I do, what should I not do, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.920]   Now, the other thing about the prefrontal cortex,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.720]   given that it has all these different subdivisions
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.020]   is that some of those subdivisions have a unique,
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.600]   what we call labeled line communication,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.800]   like a unique highway that leads to specific brain areas
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.320]   that control specific bodily functions,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.360]   including heart rate, blood pressure, et cetera.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.840]   And a little bit later in the episode,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.360]   I'll talk about a specific paper,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.900]   it's one of my favorite papers,
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.240]   in which a specific prefrontal cortical region
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.980]   is identified as controlling very primitive aspects
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.220]   of our physiology, such as body temperature and heart rate,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.200]   in reference to beliefs
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.400]   or what's happening in a social scene.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.520]   And this is very different from the way that say,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.720]   getting into cold water
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.080]   or experiencing some other sort of stressor
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.720]   causes increase in heart rate or vasoconstriction.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.780]   What we're talking about here,
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.580]   when we talk about placebo, nocebo and belief effects
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.680]   are the way in which you learn information
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.220]   or you are told information like,
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.600]   "Hey, this pill is going to do blank."
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.700]   Maybe because the label says it,
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.440]   maybe because the scientist or the doctor tells you
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.340]   that this pill does blank or this injection will do blank.
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.600]   Or maybe you learn some information
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   about what some specific drug or supplement
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.360]   or behavioral protocol will do.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.560]   And in that learning,
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.480]   you come to expect a specific set of effects
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.320]   and certain neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.880]   become active and start to activate certain neural circuits
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.780]   deeper in the brain in areas like the hypothalamus.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.440]   These are ancient, very well-conserved across animals,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.920]   areas of the brain that control very primitive functions.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.640]   Okay, they exist in essentially all mammals
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.040]   and even in reptiles.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.720]   The prefrontal cortex also communicates
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.680]   with areas of your brainstem,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.720]   controlling things like breathing, et cetera.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.320]   So the prefrontal cortex is a sophisticated area
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.400]   of your brain that takes into account context,
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.060]   both in the present, as well as memories from the past.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.560]   It can take into consideration goals about the future
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.600]   and then combines all of that into neural signals
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.440]   to areas of the brain
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.600]   that control basic physiological functions
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.820]   related to the immune system, the stress system,
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.300]   the reward system, the pleasure system and on and on.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.520]   So when we talk about placebo, nocebo and belief effects,
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.080]   what we're really talking about
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.640]   is the ability for information and specific experiences
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.440]   to lead to expectations within us
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.020]   about what's going to happen
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.540]   and then our physiology of our brain and body
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.840]   fundamentally changes such that those things happen.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.040]   So let's talk about some specific examples of placebo effects
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.680]   from the research literature.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.800]   And today we're gonna cover a lot of different examples
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.080]   from different systems, but as we do that,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.600]   I will specifically be selecting examples
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.200]   that illustrate different types of placebo effects
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.780]   and illustrate what those different types
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.240]   of placebo effects are.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.800]   Now, I should mention that
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.680]   if you're interested in placebo effects,
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.240]   there's a wonderful book
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.160]   that describes many, many different placebo effects
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.720]   and their biological underpinnings
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.480]   in cases where those biological underpinnings are understood.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   And the book I'm referring to
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.160]   is one that I used prominently in researching this episode.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.980]   It's called none other than Placebo Effects,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.860]   Understanding the Other Side of Medical Care.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.640]   And the book is by Fabrizio Benedetti.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.080]   I hope I pronounced that right, Fabrizio.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.540]   And to you Italians out there,
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.880]   if I didn't do it correctly, I apologize.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.720]   It's an absolutely wonderful book.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.480]   I confess I've never met Fabrizio Benedetti.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.840]   I confess I have no relation to the publisher
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.100]   or to the book itself,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.660]   except that I absolutely love the book.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.300]   So highly recommend this book.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.280]   I'll be pulling from a number of different examples
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.060]   described in this book today.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.180]   To my mind, one of the most interesting examples
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.280]   of placebo effect is where placebo is given
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.180]   and can profoundly change levels
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.340]   of dopamine release in the brain.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.960]   Now, the study I'm about to describe
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.000]   was done in Parkinson's patients.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.100]   People with Parkinson's have degeneration of neurons
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.980]   in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra,
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.220]   which is an area of the brain
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.320]   in the kind of bottom back part of the brain.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.160]   For you aficionados, it's the ventral tegmental area,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.520]   but you don't need to know that name.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.280]   These neurons contain dopamine and are essential
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.800]   for the generation of smooth movement patterns,
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.360]   including walking and reaching
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.320]   and moving one's hand to write, et cetera.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.960]   And of course, dopamine is involved
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.340]   in a bunch of other things too,
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.840]   including motivation and reward.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.000]   In people with Parkinson's,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.640]   depending on how severe and advanced the Parkinson's is,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.900]   they suffer deficits in the ability
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.480]   to generate smooth movements
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.640]   and often deficits in motivation
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.000]   and reward pathways as well.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.920]   Now, there are many different treatments for Parkinson's,
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.540]   some more successful than others.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.260]   Unfortunately, it's still not completely curable,
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.840]   at least not at this time,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.460]   but most of the drugs that are successful
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.160]   in treating Parkinson's to some degree or another
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.680]   are drugs that increase levels of dopamine within the brain
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.600]   for obvious reasons.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.840]   As I just mentioned,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.560]   Parkinson's is a degeneration of the dopaminergic,
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.200]   meaning dopamine containing and releasing neurons
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.160]   in the brain.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.920]   So people with Parkinson's will often be given L-DOPA,
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.660]   which is a precursor to dopamine,
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.540]   or other types of drugs that increase dopamine
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.560]   within the brain.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.760]   Now, there've been a number of studies
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.400]   that have compared certain drugs
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.420]   known to increase dopamine, such as L-DOPA,
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.680]   things like apomorphine, bromocriptine, et cetera,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.240]   to placebo control drugs.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.920]   And one of the interesting takeaways from those studies
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.480]   is that yes, drugs like L-DOPA, bromocriptine, et cetera,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.560]   increase dopamine and at least can partially
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.400]   or transiently improve symptoms of Parkinson's in many,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.500]   not all patients with Parkinson's.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.000]   The placebo drugs given in many of those studies,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.160]   which were simply a sugar pill or some other inert pill,
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.260]   it doesn't contain any chemicals
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.680]   that are known to directly bind to
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.360]   or increase dopamine in the brain.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.200]   And yet nonetheless,
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.940]   when the brains of certain patients were imaged,
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.480]   it was clear that not only was there an improvement
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   in symptomology,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.260]   but there were increases in dopamine release
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.520]   within those patients' brains,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.160]   which on the face of it should make no sense.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.560]   However, when people with Parkinson's
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.280]   or people who even don't have Parkinson's
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.400]   are told a given drug can increase dopamine,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.920]   and then they put these people into a brain imaging device,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.420]   it's called a PET device, has nothing to do with animals,
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.620]   it's the positron emission tomography device,
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.420]   and these people had been injected with
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.780]   or consumed something called a raclopride.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.320]   It sounds really weird and dangerous,
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.240]   but actually raclopride looks a little bit
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.100]   like dopamine itself chemically,
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.920]   and it has a little tag or label on it,
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.620]   and it can bind to certain receptors in the brain
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.660]   where dopamine would normally bind.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.700]   What was observed is that the placebo itself
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.160]   was causing reduced binding of this raclopride
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.600]   to areas of the brain that have dopamine receptors,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.320]   which meant unequivocally
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.640]   that there was more dopamine released in the brain,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.320]   because if more dopamine is released in the brain
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.080]   and parks in those receptors,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.360]   well, then the raclopride,
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.580]   which looks a lot like dopamine,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.980]   can't also park or bind to those receptors.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.800]   Simply put, a placebo drug,
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.060]   again, a drug that has no direct action
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.180]   on the dopaminergic system,
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.320]   if it's given to somebody who has Parkinson's or who doesn't,
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.340]   and they are told,
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.680]   this drug is going to increase levels of dopamine
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.260]   in your brain and potentially improve
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.600]   your symptoms of Parkinson's or have some other effect,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.320]   well, it succeeded in increasing dopamine levels
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.340]   within the brain,
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.100]   which basically should make us all sit back and say,
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.720]   okay, what are we to think of drugs like L-DOPA
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.680]   and apomorphine, bromocriptine as compared to placebo?
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.220]   Why isn't everyone just taking placebo?
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.420]   Why aren't we just telling people,
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.020]   hey, this sugar pill is going to increase dopamine?
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.360]   Well, two important points to answer that.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.860]   First of all, the increases in dopamine
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.640]   that are observed from placebo
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.280]   plus information about what that placebo ought to do
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.300]   for increasing dopamine are not as robust,
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.380]   or I should say generally not as robust
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.280]   as the increases in dopamine observed
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.200]   from an actual drug known to increase dopamine transmission
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.880]   or release within the brain.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.400]   The second point is that the structure
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   of the information given to somebody
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.720]   and the belief that they form about what ought to happen,
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.380]   that is the expectation effect,
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.240]   which you'll start to realize more and more
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.800]   across today's episode,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.320]   that expectation effect really is the underpinning
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.820]   of a placebo effect.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.960]   Well, the strength of that expectation
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.080]   is really hard to anchor across individuals.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.220]   And in fact, if people realize they're taking a placebo,
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.820]   the magnitude of the dopamine increase
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.480]   is actually decreased.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.360]   So this is why we use placebo controls in clinical trials.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.040]   We want to establish the real difference
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.320]   between the effect of a given drug on a biological system,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.400]   in this case, increasing dopamine,
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.880]   from the belief or the expectation
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.400]   of what that drug will do.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.800]   So in that sense, the placebo is really a measure
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.060]   of expectation of what a drug treatment will do,
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.080]   at least in the context of a drug trial.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.420]   So I mentioned this somewhat complicated example,
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.580]   because first of all,
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.100]   many people are interested in dopamine.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.180]   We all make dopamine.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.560]   It's involved in motivation, drive, and focus, and reward,
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.660]   all sorts of things that we hear a lot about these days.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.440]   Second of all, it really illustrates that placebo,
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.880]   that is expectation about what will happen,
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.580]   is impacting, of course, placebo effects.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.820]   You realize that now.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.260]   But it then also has to be the case
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.140]   that placebo effects are playing into any effect
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.700]   that we might observe from taking a given drug or supplement
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.020]   based on our expectation
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.920]   of what that drug or supplement will do.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.160]   And miraculously, or at least what I find miraculous,
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.080]   is that placebo effects,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.180]   these expectations based on knowledge and beliefs,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.900]   are highly specific,
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.160]   which raises all sorts of questions about, for instance,
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.780]   if you were given a drug that increases dopamine levels,
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.660]   but you weren't told that it increases dopamine levels,
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.900]   that perhaps you were told, you were lied to,
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.300]   and told that it increases the activity of a different
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.820]   neuromodulator like serotonin, would it?
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.060]   Well, let's explore that because as wild as that seems,
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.500]   it turns out that what we believe
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.820]   about a given drug treatment or behavioral treatment
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.860]   actually has a high degree of specificity.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.200]   So to illustrate the incredible specificity
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.940]   of placebo effects,
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.140]   I want to describe a study related to hormone function.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.340]   Hormones come in many different forms.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.260]   We have testosterone, estrogen, growth hormone,
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.180]   cortisol, et cetera.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.580]   There's a study that was carried out in humans
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.580]   in which subjects were informed
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.460]   about growth hormone release and cortisol release.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.300]   Growth hormone is a hormone released from a gland
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.340]   in the brain called the pituitary.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.900]   The pituitary has different parts.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.880]   The anterior pituitary releases growth hormone.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.900]   Each night when you go to sleep,
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.320]   it's involved in protein synthesis, tissue repair,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.260]   bodily growth, appendage growth, and many other things.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.660]   Cortisol is a hormone that's released from the adrenals.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.380]   It can also be synthesized and released
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.460]   in a couple other places in the brain and body.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.120]   And it's involved in immune system function,
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.580]   in anti-inflammatory action.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.040]   A lot of people think cortisol is bad,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.740]   but it's actually an important hormone for our daily health,
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.860]   our alertness and waking up in the morning, et cetera.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.540]   In any event, subjects in this study
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.860]   learned about growth hormone and cortisol
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.180]   and their release, where they're released from,
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.220]   what they do, just as you did.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.800]   And then their growth hormone and cortisol levels
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.260]   were measured, and not surprisingly, they didn't change.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.740]   Just learning about growth hormone and cortisol
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.660]   did not change growth hormone or cortisol levels
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.520]   in these human subjects.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.900]   Now, on days two and three of this experiment,
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.100]   subjects received an injection of a drug.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.660]   The drug is called sumatriptan.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.940]   And sumatriptan is known to increase levels
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.720]   of growth hormone and reduce levels of cortisol.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.300]   And indeed, that's what they observed.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.920]   When people received these injections
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.460]   and then their blood was drawn,
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.860]   growth hormone levels went up, cortisol levels went down.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.620]   Now, the interesting part of the study
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.860]   is a separate day, okay?
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.100]   So after the drug treatments,
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.300]   they come back and they are injected with saline,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.420]   which has no specific biological effect.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.420]   It's simply saltwater, okay?
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.560]   They're injected with saline,
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.940]   and they experience increases in growth hormone
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.000]   and decreases in cortisol,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.680]   which on the face of it might seem like,
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.100]   wow, that's incredible.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.060]   But based on what you've learned thus far
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.520]   in today's episode,
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.260]   you can imagine that knowledge about growth hormone
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.500]   and cortisol somehow combined with the injection
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.440]   to lead to an expectation of increases in growth hormone
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.620]   and decreases in cortisol,
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.660]   which would be amazing in its own right, okay?
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.420]   After all, saline is inert.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.840]   It doesn't do anything directly and specifically
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.220]   to the growth hormone or cortisol system.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.180]   But get this, it turns out that a saline injection,
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:13.460]   which does nothing on its own on day four or five
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.780]   after people have received this drug treatment,
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.140]   increases growth hormone and decreases cortisol
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.760]   independent of what people are told
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.200]   they are being injected with.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.060]   Even if they're told they're being injected with a drug
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.460]   that has completely different effects than sumatriptan.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.180]   So why would this be?
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.660]   How could this be?
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.140]   In fact, there was even a condition
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.500]   in which subjects were told
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.540]   on the day they received the placebo,
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.260]   you're about to get an injection of something
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.100]   that's going to decrease growth hormone,
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.300]   but rather they experienced a genuine increase
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.140]   in growth hormone and decrease in cortisol
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.900]   in the exact same way they did
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.860]   when they received the active drug sumatriptan.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.660]   Okay, so this wild type of scenario has to be explained.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.840]   And in order to explain it,
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.540]   we need to zoom out from the experiment
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.780]   and ask what's the similarity
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.620]   between day two and three of the experiment,
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.380]   meaning the days in which the people received
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.940]   the actual active drug sumatriptan
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.440]   that increases growth hormone, reduces cortisol,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.780]   and the day in which they received the placebo.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.240]   And the one thing that anchors both those days together,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.620]   meaning the one thing in common
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.380]   that can explain this effect is that those were the days
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.700]   in which people received an injection.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.700]   And in fact, through various control experiments
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.940]   and a few other experiments
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.460]   that were done subsequent to this,
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.920]   because this experiment has been more or less repeated
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.900]   in different forms in different laboratories,
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.140]   it became clear that the brain and body
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:43.140]   somehow came to expect that receiving an injection
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.220]   leads to increases in growth hormone and cortisol.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.220]   Now, this is not an indefinite effect, right?
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.300]   People will get injections of other things in the future,
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.700]   presumably active drugs, not just saline,
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.220]   that will change hormone levels
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.900]   or change neurotransmitter levels.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.020]   But in this experiment, what happened is,
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.360]   is that there was a pairing within the nervous system.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.560]   There was somehow a binding of the notion
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.600]   of getting an injection with a syringe,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.180]   which in the first case was of a drug
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.300]   that increases growth hormone, decreases cortisol.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.120]   And then when subjects came back and were injected,
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.480]   with a different syringe, presumably, I would hope so,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.200]   with a different syringe filled with saline,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.100]   even though the saline should do nothing,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.220]   the body and brain had somehow formed a pairing,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.720]   an association between syringe injection
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.420]   and increased growth hormone, decreased cortisol,
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.820]   which is incredible given that these systems,
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.040]   the anterior pituitary, the adrenal glands,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.700]   I mean, these are ancient systems that to our knowledge,
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.500]   we can't directly control with our mind.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.540]   I can't simply close my eyes and grit my teeth
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.940]   and cause the release of growth hormone.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.320]   I can't simply decide to deploy cortisol from my adrenals.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.340]   Although if I thought about something very, very stressful
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.180]   for a long time,
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.720]   there'd probably be some cortisol secretion.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.620]   But to our knowledge, there is no way to use thoughts,
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.700]   to use beliefs, to use understanding of knowledge,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.540]   to cause changes in our endocrine glands, right?
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.140]   Our hormone length, the pituitary, the adrenals.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.620]   But here we have a case where a drug
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.540]   that increases certain hormones and decreases other hormones
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.780]   simply by virtue of the fact
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.160]   that it was injected into somebody,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.440]   leads to a case where subsequent injections,
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.940]   at least in the short run,
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.560]   lead to the exact same hormone changes,
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.560]   simply because in the mind and or body of these individuals,
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.080]   injection comes to equal increase in growth hormone,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.300]   decrease in cortisol, independent of what's being injected.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.620]   Now, a key point is that
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.660]   had on the final day of the experiment,
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.580]   the subject's been injected with a different drug
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.540]   that for instance, increases serotonin
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.100]   or reduces epinephrine,
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.020]   I doubt that they would have instead experienced increases
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.180]   in growth hormone and reductions in cortisol.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.220]   That's simply not the case.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.480]   The fact that there was only saline in there
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.980]   meant that there was an opportunity for the syringe
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.740]   and the injection, we don't know which,
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.620]   to lead to some sort of paired association
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.460]   in the brain and body
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.680]   that led to increased growth hormone, decreased cortisol,
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.280]   which mimicked the drug effect.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.800]   But the whole scenario here, as wild as it is,
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.720]   really speaks to the fact that oftentimes
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.060]   we think a given treatment is causing a given effect
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.520]   only because of the action of the drug
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.840]   or the action of a given behavioral protocol.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.600]   But in fact, the drug and the protocol
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.720]   exist in a big context of different things
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.500]   that the brain and body are integrating
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.540]   and trying to make sense of,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.840]   and that often gets lumped together.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.780]   I often say that your brain is, yes, a prediction machine,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.380]   but it's also trying to simplify things in those predictions.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.660]   It's not taking into account all the information.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.540]   It's often lumping information together
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.420]   and coming up with ideas about what's going to happen and why
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.760]   and doing this subconsciously
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.260]   in a way that, as you just learned,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.400]   can have profound effects on what happens within us,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.380]   even at the level of something as basic as hormone release.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.980]   Now, what I just described is a pretty extreme example,
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.500]   and it's a very experimental condition type example.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.380]   I mean, it's rare that people are undergoing
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.740]   these kinds of organized receivable of information
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.320]   followed by specific drug treatments
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.980]   and placebo injections, et cetera.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.580]   But you've all experienced the placebo effect in action
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.980]   by way of what's called classical conditioning
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.380]   simply by virtue of the fact
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.200]   that the smells of certain foods
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.660]   and your past experience of certain foods
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.420]   can lead to the release of a hormone called insulin.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.540]   Insulin is a hormone that is involved
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.660]   in regulating blood glucose, blood sugar.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.360]   And typically when insulin levels go up in the bloodstream,
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.940]   glucose levels are going to go down
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.060]   because of the way that insulin controls blood sugar levels.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.880]   Now, if you've ever had the experience
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.500]   of walking past a bakery or a pizza shop
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.500]   where a delicious smell is wafting out into the environment,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.300]   you may notice that it "makes you hungry."
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.620]   And indeed it does make you hungry
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.460]   because presumably you've had the experience
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.500]   of certain smells being associated
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.640]   with the consuming of certain foods,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.100]   maybe bakery foods, maybe pizza,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.180]   maybe steak, whatever it is.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.860]   And the consumption of those foods
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.320]   actually leads to increases in insulin in your bloodstream.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.120]   Well, there's the so-called conditioning effect
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.240]   whereby the smell of the food itself
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.900]   starts to lead to increases in insulin.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.060]   But the conditioning effects of different stimuli,
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.860]   different things in the context of eating
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.300]   and specific foods leading to increases in insulin
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.720]   is actually highly, highly modifiable.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.660]   So much so that experiments have been done
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.900]   where for instance, somebody eats a particular food
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.300]   or in some cases it's just directly injected with insulin,
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.620]   but more often consumes a particular food.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.540]   And just prior to consuming or during consuming that food,
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.680]   there's a bell ringing or a buzzer
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.260]   in the background going off.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.760]   And they do that a few times.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.780]   And then I'm sure you're anticipating what's coming.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.900]   Somebody can just hear the buzzer
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.440]   or the bell can simply ring
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.300]   and that person will experience an increase in insulin.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.000]   So what I'm describing is a conditioned insulin response.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.860]   A stimulus such as a bell or a buzzer
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.220]   that on its own should have zero effect on insulin release
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.500]   has been paired with a food
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.660]   that genuinely increases insulin within the bloodstream.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.740]   And then even if the food isn't present,
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.940]   the stimulus, the buzzer, the bell, et cetera,
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.780]   can evoke the insulin response.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.560]   Now, this is an important example to understand
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.780]   because it's a common one
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.620]   that we've presumably all experienced
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.840]   and that exists within the wiring of our brain right now.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.660]   But it's different than the smell
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.980]   evoking the insulin response
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.840]   because delicious food which evokes an insulin response,
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.020]   having a particular odor,
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.640]   that makes sense in the context of food.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.880]   But here we're talking about something
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.500]   completely unrelated to the food,
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.480]   not the odor, not the taste, not the appearance,
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.640]   just something that happened to be in the environment
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.060]   in which you ate the food
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.820]   leading to an increase in insulin.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.940]   And it just screams placebo effect,
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.380]   but it also screams that the placebo effect
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.940]   is strongly modifiable according to context.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.400]   Again, the prefrontal cortex
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.500]   being the seat of the anticipation or placebo effect
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.540]   and the prefrontal cortex
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.940]   taking into account lots of things in the environment
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.820]   trying to understand what's here, what sounds, what smells,
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.820]   what colors, and then lumping all of that together
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.800]   and eventually through the activation
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.940]   of specific neural circuits
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.840]   leading to a very basic hormonal response,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.700]   in this case, the release of insulin.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.060]   And of course, what I just described
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.460]   is classical conditioning a la Pavlov.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.100]   Pavlov won the Nobel Prize
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.780]   for his description of classical conditioning
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.340]   in which dogs could be induced to salivate
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.040]   in anticipation of food by way of a stimulus
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.660]   completely unrelated to food itself,
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.700]   not the smell, not the look, not the taste,
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.980]   rather just a bell rung
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.340]   before the consumption of food in a dog
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.800]   eventually led to a situation
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.940]   where the mere ringing of a bell
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.500]   could evoke salivation from those dogs.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.800]   So are we all just like salivating dogs?
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.100]   I guess we are.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.460]   I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.440]   and thank one of our sponsors and that's AG1.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.060]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.340]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.460]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.720]   The reason I started taking it
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.540]   and the reason I still take it every day
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.900]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.660]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.520]   And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.040]   to support gut health.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.500]   Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.140]   we realized is not just important for the health of our gut,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.300]   but also for our immune system
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.460]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.020]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.980]   In other words, gut health is critical
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.860]   for proper brain functioning.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.540]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.980]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.940]   but there are a number of things in AG1,
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.660]   including specific micronutrients
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.220]   that are hard to get from whole foods
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.100]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.520]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.300]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.860]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.020]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.140]   what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1,
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.440]   because AG1 supports so many different systems
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.640]   within the body that are involved in mental health,
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.260]   physical health, and performance.
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.140]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.260]   and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.380]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.180]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.900]   Okay, so given that context is a powerful modifier
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.140]   of the placebo effect,
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.780]   and in fact may be central to the placebo effect,
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.020]   I just want to rattle off a few of the known placebo effects
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.420]   that have been demonstrated,
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.480]   which show the extent to which your brain and my brain
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.380]   are coming up with ideas about what given drugs
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.780]   or given behavioral treatments ought to do,
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.680]   and in that way, shaping what happens
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.540]   when you take a placebo.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.600]   Or, and this is an idea that we'll go into
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.260]   in a bit more detail in a few minutes,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.600]   perhaps context is also changing the way that active drugs,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.660]   not placebos, but active drugs
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.240]   are impacting your brain and body.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.900]   The examples I'd like to give are from laboratory studies
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.580]   about the placebo effect,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.380]   but that relate to very common at-home
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.180]   and normal life scenarios, okay?
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.060]   They are not unique to the laboratory,
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.780]   and they are the following.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.160]   First of all, placebo effects are strongly modifiable
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:17.100]   by the expectation of the quality of a given treatment.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.380]   For instance, if you are given a placebo
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.860]   that has a brand name on it or a name of a drug,
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.080]   it could even be a made-up name,
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   you don't know what the drug does,
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.160]   but it has trademark TM there in the corner of the name,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.620]   so brand name as opposed to generic placebo,
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.880]   the brand name placebo has a stronger effect.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   Moreover, if a placebo is placed into a package,
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.160]   not just put in front of you on a little tray
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.700]   or in a little dish, but rather in a package
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.420]   where you have to push it through that little foil wrapping,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.780]   or you have to take it out of a bottle,
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.820]   and especially if that wrapping or bottle has a label on it,
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.420]   or it looks as if it's a quote-unquote real drug,
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.860]   well, then the placebo has an even greater placebo effect.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   The color of a given drug can even have an effect
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.840]   based on our association or expectation
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.280]   of what different colors relate to
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.860]   in terms of our physiology.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.500]   For instance, if subjects are given pills
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.340]   that they are told will help them fall and stay asleep,
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.980]   and some subjects are given blue pills,
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.440]   other subjects are given red pills,
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   other subjects are given yellow pills,
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.140]   the subjects that take the blue pills
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.140]   tend to sleep better even though all the pills,
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.720]   regardless of color, are placebo,
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.900]   they contain no active substance.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.180]   Okay, so for some reason, most people associate
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.500]   the color blue with sleep, whereas,
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.380]   or I should say by contrast,
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.660]   if people are given a blue, a red, or a yellow pill,
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.680]   and they are told it's a stimulant,
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.260]   the subject's taking the red pill,
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.700]   here I mean the actual literal red pill,
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.100]   I'm not talking about any kind of cultural red pill,
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.380]   I haven't seen "The Matrix" yet,
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.660]   people tell me I need to see it,
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.460]   but I'm not talking about taking the red pill quote-unquote,
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.580]   I'm talking about taking a pill that is the color red
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.820]   in an experiment, the people that take that pill
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.820]   experience a greater placebo-induced stimulant effect
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.500]   as opposed to when subjects take a blue or a yellow pill.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.260]   For some reason, the color red is associated
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.900]   with a quote-unquote upper effect or stimulant effect.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.780]   Moreover, if subjects are given a blue, a red,
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.900]   or a yellow pill, and they are told that the pill
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.500]   will have an antidepressant effect,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.220]   the subjects that took the yellow placebo
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.860]   get the biggest antidepressant effect.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.300]   So color of a given pill even impacts the direction
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.540]   or in this case, the magnitude of the placebo effect.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.520]   And I should mention that in every one of those studies,
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.940]   yes, there was information about
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.300]   what the given pill should do.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.400]   It was not the case that if people took the red pill,
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.940]   they felt a stimulant effect,
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.140]   if they took a blue pill, they felt a sleepy effect,
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.220]   and if they took the yellow pill,
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.820]   they felt an antidepressant effect.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.220]   These were three separate experiments,
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.020]   one on sleep where subjects were given
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.120]   one of the three colors of pills,
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.380]   blue had the strongest effect,
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.700]   or a study of stimulant effects.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.340]   They were told it's a study of pills
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.480]   that will increase alertness and attention.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.040]   They were given one of three different colors,
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.000]   the red pills had the biggest effect.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.880]   And the third experiment, subjects were told
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.900]   this is a pill that will alleviate to some degree
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.500]   your symptoms of depression.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.620]   The people who took the yellow pill
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.560]   experienced the greatest relief of depressive symptoms.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.960]   Now that's pretty wild, but what perhaps is even wilder
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.660]   is the more invasive a placebo intervention is,
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.180]   the greater the placebo effect.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.580]   So capsules have a bigger effect than tablets.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.860]   I don't know if that's more invasive,
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.300]   but I guess it looks more medicinal
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.100]   to have a capsule versus a tablet, who knows why,
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.680]   but that's what's been observed.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.220]   An injection of a placebo has a greater effect
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.960]   than a consumption of a capsule or a tablet, of course.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.080]   And if people are placed into a medical device or machine,
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.100]   especially in cases where one of their limbs
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.580]   or both of their limbs or even their whole body
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.980]   is placed into a device,
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.900]   even though the device is doing absolutely nothing
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.540]   specifically to our biological system, it is inert, right?
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.360]   A bunch of buttons and a bunch of noises
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.120]   and a bunch of humming as if something were happening,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.180]   but nothing is happening that directly relates
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.200]   to any one specific biological system except,
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.760]   and now you know what I'm about to say,
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.500]   except expectation of what the machine is doing.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.140]   Well, that has the greatest placebo effect of all.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.840]   So for some reason, as the level of invasiveness
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.340]   or the, let's just say the complexity
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.200]   of a given treatment is increased,
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.300]   well then the magnitude of the placebo effect
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.900]   is also increased.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.080]   And what this tells us is that the human brain
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.040]   has come to associate level of invasiveness,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.980]   level of complexity of a given treatment or machine
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.940]   to equate to bigger outcomes.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.220]   And in some sense, that's completely logical,
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   but again, we have to remember in absolutely zero
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.140]   of these conditions, whether or not it's a tablet,
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   a capsule, an injection, or a medical device,
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.440]   is there anything being done to these human subjects
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.700]   that impacts a specific biological function except one?
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.980]   And that one again is the activation
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.100]   of specific neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.680]   that then are able to communicate with other areas
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.600]   of the brain and body through bonafide biological mechanisms
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.640]   of neurotransmitter release and electrical activity
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.080]   in neurons, this is what the brain does.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.920]   And of course, the prefrontal cortex being part
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.480]   of the brain, those are the mechanisms it employs
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.960]   to change the activity of hormone releasing glands,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.120]   to change the activity of other neurons.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.040]   In other words, the belief effects,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.320]   the expectations are real.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.080]   They are having effects through true biological circuitry.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.880]   It's just that the pills and the treatments
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.280]   and the machines are not doing anything specific at all
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.200]   except activating expectation.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.360]   So we've been talking about the placebo effect
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.600]   and I've been giving examples of strong placebo effects.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.680]   And while all of what I told you is substantiated by data,
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.480]   I do not wanna give you the impression
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.420]   that the placebo effect is limitless
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.680]   because it is not limitless.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.520]   For instance, placebos have been used to help
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.240]   in the treatment of cancer,
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.560]   but their effects within the treatment of cancer
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.160]   are limited to a very specific set of symptoms and contexts.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.020]   So for instance, people who are told a given drug
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.880]   will help them with their cancer
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.720]   by reducing their symptoms of chemotherapy
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.920]   or radiation therapy, often experience reductions
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.200]   in the negative symptoms of chemotherapy
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.960]   or radiation therapy, reduced pain, reduced nausea,
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.320]   and by consequence, improved feelings of wellbeing
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.880]   compared to people who do not receive the placebo
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   and who are not told, hey, this drug,
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.000]   which in reality is a placebo,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.840]   is going to help you with your treatment.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.240]   It's going to make it less uncomfortable, okay?
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.080]   So in the context of cancer treatment,
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.360]   placebo can reduce the discomfort
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.280]   of various cancer treatments.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.960]   However, placebos cannot reduce the size
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.300]   or eliminate tumors.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.480]   If people who unfortunately have tumors, okay, cancer,
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.040]   are given a placebo and told this drug,
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.680]   which actually is a placebo, unbeknownst to them,
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.920]   is going to reduce the size of your tumors
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.960]   or eliminate your tumors,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.140]   that placebo is not effective in reducing the size
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.480]   or eliminating those tumors.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.860]   This is very important to understand
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.240]   because as you recall, placebo effects
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.600]   are expectation effects.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.200]   Expectation effects are driven in large part
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.520]   by the prefrontal cortex and its connectivity
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.240]   to other areas of the brain and thereby to the body,
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.480]   but the outputs of the prefrontal cortex are limited.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.000]   There are a certain number of them,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.840]   and indeed there are many of them,
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.200]   but those connections do not extend to tumors themselves
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.600]   or biological systems or circuitries
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.760]   that allow one's beliefs to reduce the size of
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.280]   or eliminate tumors.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.580]   And this is very important because unfortunately,
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.240]   there are many sufferers of cancer
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.200]   and there are many theories
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.880]   about accelerating the treatment of
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.160]   or improving the treatment of,
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.840]   or even curing cancer using so-called mind-body techniques
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.200]   or mind-body tools.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.540]   And we need to be fair to the data
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.280]   which have conclusively shown that reductions in stress,
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.960]   improvements in sleep, social support,
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.900]   a number of things can improve cancer treatment outcomes.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.880]   Now, those are not placebo effects.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.440]   Those are all practices for which we know
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.760]   there are reductions in inflammation,
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:34.000]   reductions in stress hormones that lead to improved outcomes
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.500]   in the context of radiation therapy,
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.960]   in the context of immunotherapy,
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.640]   in the context of any bona fide treatments
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.840]   known to reduce tumor size.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.760]   So what we need to do is separate out three things here.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.040]   Behavioral practices, such as meditation,
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.400]   sleep, social support,
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.120]   known to reduce inflammation and stress,
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.600]   and that can improve cancer outcomes.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.100]   Those are not placebo effects.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.240]   Those are real effects.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.320]   There are also drugs, radiation, chemotherapy,
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.920]   immunotherapy, and devices known to reduce tumor size
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.000]   and hopefully eliminate cancerous tumors.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.060]   That would be the hope.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.480]   Those are real effects.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.580]   And then there are the placebo effects,
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.660]   the knowledge and belief and expectation
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.580]   about what a given treatment will do.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.200]   In some cases, it's knowledge about what a given drug will do
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.060]   that improves the outcome achieved with that drug.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.280]   In some cases, it's people being given
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.260]   a completely inert substance or solution,
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.300]   like saline solution,
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.740]   but being told this is going to help
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.000]   with your nausea symptoms,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.660]   this is going to help with your pain
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.240]   during your immunotherapy, radiation, et cetera.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.080]   And those are real effects,
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.700]   but they can only be explained
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.260]   by virtue of expectation and knowledge,
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.280]   AKA placebo effects.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.500]   And I want to emphasize that those placebo effects
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.820]   are not acting directly on tumors
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.300]   to reduce their size or eliminate them.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.780]   Another example of how placebo effects can be very powerful
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.140]   and yet still have limits to them
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.040]   is yet another study from Dr. Ted Kaptchuk's lab
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.280]   at Harvard Medical School.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.900]   And by the way, many, not all of the studies
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.400]   that I've been describing today
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.960]   have been done by the Kaptchuk lab.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.880]   He's done beautiful work on placebo effects
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.980]   for a very long time now.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.020]   He's considered a real pioneer
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.580]   and a leader in the study of placebo.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.100]   And he's also been a big proponent
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.120]   of exploring the placebo effect,
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.020]   not simply as a contrast to drug effects or device effects,
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.220]   but as their own specific effect
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.820]   that perhaps can be leveraged
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.980]   in the context of treating disease.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.780]   So hats off, literally, plural hats off
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.520]   because they've had oh so many discoveries
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.780]   in the context of placebo and their powerful effects
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.860]   and their possible uses from the Kaptchuk lab
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.140]   and their colleagues there at Harvard Medical School.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.420]   Just incredible work.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.740]   And one of my favorite studies from the Kaptchuk lab
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.460]   is one published in the New England Journal of Medicine
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.100]   some years ago in which they took people
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.020]   who had asthma, so these are people diagnosed with asthma.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:02.140]   These are people who have challenges breathing
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.260]   and they experience a lot of discomfort
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.960]   in trying to breathe normally
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.400]   unless they are taking their asthma medication.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.740]   In this study, they took people off
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.360]   of their asthma medication, of course, not indefinitely,
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.420]   but for a short period of time and as expected,
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.780]   those people experienced challenges in breathing
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.780]   and discomfort associated with the challenges in breathing.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.060]   One group received no treatment.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.260]   They were just taken off their asthma meds and evaluated
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.640]   and then of course, put back on their asthma meds.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.380]   Another group received a placebo treatment
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.460]   and another group received a drug
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.780]   known to improve the symptoms of asthma.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.600]   Now, what was interesting is that the people
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.240]   who received the drug for the treatment of asthma,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.120]   not surprisingly, had improvements in breathing
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.500]   and less discomfort, exactly what you'd expect.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.620]   However, the people with placebo
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.900]   also experienced less discomfort in breathing,
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.940]   but their patterns of breathing didn't change.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.600]   So again, this really speaks to the fact
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.800]   that placebo effects can be very powerful,
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.620]   but that they're very specific.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.540]   They are not simply wiping out a condition like asthma
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.460]   or completely eliminating all symptomology
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.420]   of a given condition like cancer.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.260]   This study illustrates very clearly
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.220]   that placebo is effective in reducing the discomfort
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.920]   associated with the challenges of breathing,
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.600]   but not eliminating challenges with breathing per se.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.620]   Whereas, as I mentioned before,
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.980]   there are drugs, bona fide prescription drug treatments
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.760]   that can both restore normal patterns of breathing
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.480]   and relieve the discomfort.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.620]   So what this really speaks to is the fact
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.060]   that the prefrontal cortex and its involvement
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.960]   and expectation can have powerful effects
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.420]   on things like pain, powerful effects
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.420]   on things like dopamine, powerful effects
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:49.640]   on any number of different brain and body systems,
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.500]   but not all of them.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   Our beliefs and expectations are powerful
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.960]   as evidenced by the placebo effect itself,
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.020]   but they are not what we call omnipotent.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.080]   They can't do anything and everything.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.200]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.620]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.080]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.760]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.380]   to help you better understand your body
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.160]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.920]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.760]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.000]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.840]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.940]   A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.320]   however, is that you get information back
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.200]   about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.240]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.460]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.380]   because they have a personalized platform
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.940]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.440]   metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.320]   but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.640]   that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.920]   supplements, et cetera,
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.180]   that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.560]   that are optimal for you.

[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.280]   One of my all-time favorite studies
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.040]   in the context of placebo
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.500]   is a paper that was published pretty recently.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.620]   And the title of this paper is "Nicotine-Related Beliefs
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.760]   Induce Dose-Dependent Responses in the Human Brain."
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.480]   And if ever there was a paper that pointed to the fact
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.340]   that our belief systems can really shape the way
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.280]   that different drugs, different supplements,
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.080]   different behavioral protocols can impact
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.320]   the way that our physiology and our brain work,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.640]   it's this paper.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.320]   It's a pretty straightforward study.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.560]   It was, of course, carried out in humans.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.980]   And what they did is they had people vape nicotine.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.760]   Nicotine is a known cognitive enhancer.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.440]   Nicotine, so named because it binds
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.680]   to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain,
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.520]   which is just fancy nerd speak for the receptors,
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.040]   the little parking spots for acetylcholine,
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.900]   a neuromodulator that's involved in attention,
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.580]   and by virtue of being involved in attention
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:04.480]   is critical for the performance of certain focused tasks.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   So most people associate nicotine with smoking,
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.160]   vaping, dipping, or snuffing.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.040]   Here, we're talking about nicotine that's vaped.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.480]   However, I want to be very clear.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.280]   I am not encouraging people to vape nicotine.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.460]   Yes, vaping is probably healthier for you than smoking,
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.660]   but vaping is not good for you.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.040]   It would be better to not vape than to vape at all.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.040]   I did an entire episode about nicotine.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.040]   So I want to leave aside the issue
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.800]   of whether or not you decide to use nicotine.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.640]   Okay, that's all covered in the episode on nicotine.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.800]   I'll provide a link to that in the show note captions.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.200]   There's a lot of considerations there.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.520]   It does increase blood pressure
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.560]   and it increases vasoconstriction and on and on.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.280]   But as I mentioned, nicotine is a cognitive enhancer.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.740]   It can increase focus and attention
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.240]   and in doing so, it can allow your brain
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.840]   to do certain things better like task switching,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.720]   like focusing in the context of a lot of distraction,
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.080]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.320]   So in this study, nicotine-related beliefs
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.960]   induce dose-dependent responses in the human brain.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   Subjects used a vape to ingest nicotine
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.640]   and they were told that they were either ingesting
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.520]   a low, medium, or high concentration of nicotine.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.020]   And a really nice thing about this study
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.160]   is that they actually measured how much nicotine
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.000]   people vaped.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.200]   So they were able to measure how much nicotine
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.380]   made it into the bloodstreams of these people.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.760]   And they were also able to evaluate brain activity
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.920]   in areas of the brain known to have
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.160]   these nicotinic receptors and to also be involved
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.080]   in certain cognitive tasks.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.420]   So just to get to the grand conclusion of the study,
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.240]   what they found is that people who were told
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.600]   that they ingested a high concentration
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.920]   or a medium concentration of nicotine
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.200]   performed better on a cognitive task that we know
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.360]   is dependent on or can be modified
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.180]   by the amount of acetylcholine transmission
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.700]   in a certain area of the brain,
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.660]   then did individuals who were told that they ingested
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.880]   a small concentration of nicotine.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.800]   Now, the interesting part of the study
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.040]   is that everybody consumed the same amount of nicotine.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.160]   So here we have a situation where there is a so-called
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.200]   dose-dependent placebo effect.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.540]   Everyone gets the same amount of nicotine,
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.280]   but people are either told,
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.160]   meaning they were lied to in some cases,
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.200]   that they got a small, medium,
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.240]   or high concentration of nicotine.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.120]   And for the group that was told that they received
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   a medium concentration of nicotine,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.280]   they performed better on a cognitive task,
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   then did the people who were told they received
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.860]   a smaller concentration of nicotine.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.560]   Moreover, people who were told that they received
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.960]   a high concentration of nicotine performed better
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.360]   than either the individuals who were told
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.780]   they received a medium or small concentration of nicotine.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.320]   But as I mentioned before,
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:46.800]   everyone received the same concentration of nicotine.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.960]   So this tells us that not only are placebo effects
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.860]   related to expectation,
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.400]   but that the expectation somebody has
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.960]   of the degree of an effect they should experience
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.480]   actually creates a different level of experience.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   Put differently, if you're told that you're getting
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.280]   a small amount of drug, a medium amount of drug,
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.400]   or a high amount of drug,
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.320]   and that the size of an effect gets bigger
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.600]   as you go from small, medium to high,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.460]   well, then you will experience the small, medium,
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.560]   or high effect depending on which group you were in,
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.440]   even if you all got the same dose of drug.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.320]   Now I need to be very clear, everybody got actual nicotine.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.520]   The placebo effect here is related to what people believed
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.980]   about the dose of nicotine they got,
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:33.320]   but everyone got active nicotine.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.280]   Now here's where it gets really cool.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.740]   As I mentioned earlier in this study,
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.720]   they imaged the brains of people
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.400]   that were in either the group that was told
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.320]   they got a small or medium
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.400]   or high concentration of nicotine.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.840]   And what they found is that in the specific area
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.240]   of the brain that is known to respond to nicotine
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.480]   and that is involved in cognitive functioning
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.720]   related to the task that these subjects were given,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.620]   they saw increased levels of activity of the neurons
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.560]   in that brain region that scaled up
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.520]   according to whether or not people were told
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.440]   they got a small, medium, or high amount of nicotine.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.600]   Again, everyone got the same amount of nicotine.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.160]   They were simply told small, medium, or high,
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.620]   and the brain area itself changed its level of activity,
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.480]   which in turn changed the outcome on the cognitive task,
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.420]   which basically puts everything in a really nice box,
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.560]   wraps it up with wrapping paper beautifully,
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.860]   puts it in a bow and says, okay, placebo effects are real.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.460]   And placebo effects scale
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.580]   with the degree of expectation that one has.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.220]   So anytime we are told that a small dose of something
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.820]   is going to lead to a small effect,
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.420]   a medium dose of something
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.820]   is going to lead to a bigger effect,
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.180]   and a high dose will lead to an even higher effect,
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:48.780]   well, whether or not that occurs is going to depend a lot
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.020]   on what sorts of quote unquote effects we are expecting.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.820]   Again, you can't use placebo to eliminate tumors.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.980]   There's a limit to what placebo effects can occur,
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:01.140]   but assuming that the effect that one is interested in
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:04.580]   is modifiable by knowledge and expectation,
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.020]   well, the size of that effect will scale
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.220]   with how big you expect the effect to be,
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.340]   and it's not purely psychological.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.240]   That's the point here.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.900]   It's not just about your beliefs
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.460]   and you doing something very different
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.340]   in the context of a task or in a sports event.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.060]   Your physiology, in this case,
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.260]   the activity of a specific brain region
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.300]   increases its level of output
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.100]   according to your expectation
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.700]   of the level of drug you consumed.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.460]   So in my description of that recently published study,
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.700]   you notice I said placebo effects,
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.960]   but in many ways what I was describing were belief effects.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.620]   It's a little bit difficult to disentangle
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.980]   what's a placebo effect and what's a belief effect.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.580]   In general, belief effects
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.240]   have to do with acquiring a bit more information
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.820]   or specificity of information
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.260]   about what the expectation should be.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.900]   So I suppose the study I just described
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.200]   could easily fall under the category of belief effects
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.900]   and not just placebo effects,
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.260]   but nonetheless, belief effects are powerful.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.680]   And they're especially powerful
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.540]   because as one starts to layer in different amounts
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.740]   and different types of information
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.340]   as to what a given drug treatment
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.860]   or behavioral treatment will do,
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:15.180]   one can start to see really nuanced outcomes
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.500]   as well as truly surprising outcomes.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:20.200]   And some of my favorite studies on belief effects
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.780]   were done by my colleague at Stanford.
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.100]   She's in the Department of Psychology.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.380]   Her name is Dr. Alia Crum.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.900]   She's been a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast before.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.920]   We will also provide a link to that episode.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.980]   And Ali's lab studies mindsets.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.020]   Mindsets, of course, incorporate a lot of things
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:35.980]   besides beliefs.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.540]   They involve prior knowledge.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.400]   They tend to have even more information woven into them
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.540]   than either placebo effects or belief effects.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:45.400]   But Ali's really one of the world leaders
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.200]   in understanding these belief effects
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.060]   and has done some just gorgeous work
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.620]   in illustrating the incredible range
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.120]   and extent of belief effects that exist.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.080]   One of my favorite studies in this context
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.020]   is the paper from Ali's lab entitled Mind Over Milkshakes.
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.900]   Mindsets, not just nutrients, determine the ghrelin response.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.620]   So here, I'll just briefly describe the study.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.340]   I'll paraphrase the abstract.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.260]   On two separate occasions,
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.540]   people consumed a 380 calorie milkshake.
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:17.620]   And they were either told that it was a 620 calorie,
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.620]   quote unquote, indulgent shake, or a 140 calorie,
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.100]   quote unquote, sensible shake.
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:27.020]   Then the hormone ghrelin was measured.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.780]   Ghrelin is a hormone associated with hunger.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.480]   It is released from and binds to various sites
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.920]   within the brain and body.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.220]   But it's generally associated with the hunger response,
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.440]   the desire for food.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.620]   Then their subjects had their blood drawn
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.040]   at three different time points.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.260]   So at baseline, prior to consumption of the milkshake.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:50.220]   Anticipatory, meaning just prior to consuming the milkshake.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.600]   And post-consumption, 90 minutes
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.420]   after consuming the milkshake.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:57.640]   And then ghrelin was measured within the blood samples
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.040]   that the people provided.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:57:59.880]   Now, as you recall,
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.580]   everyone is consuming the same 380 calorie shake,
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.660]   but that's unbeknownst to them.
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.100]   One group thinks they're drinking an indulgent shake
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.020]   that has lots of calories.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.620]   The other group thinks they're ingesting a quote unquote,
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.100]   sensible shake with fewer calories.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:16.940]   And it's important to note that in the study,
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.840]   the individuals were asked to read the labels of the shake
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.900]   and get information about, okay, this is an indulgent shake.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.020]   Has a lot of calories, a lot of fat, et cetera.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.180]   In the other case, this shake has very few calories.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.120]   It contains healthy ingredients, et cetera.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.820]   Now you can probably guess where this is going.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.500]   The people that consumed the milkshake,
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.740]   but we're told it was a high calorie indulgent shake.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.380]   And also by the way, consumed information
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:42.820]   about it being high calorie and indulgent,
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.740]   or they're reading that on the label,
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.540]   experienced steeper reductions
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.100]   in this hunger associated hormone called ghrelin,
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.780]   as compared to the group that also consumed
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.880]   the same 380 calorie shake,
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.420]   but thought that the shake was a sensible shake
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.620]   with fewer calories that was a healthier shake.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.480]   Those people experienced reductions in ghrelin as well,
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.780]   but they were less steep.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:07.900]   They occurred less quickly over time.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:11.060]   And in addition, their subjective level of satiety,
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:14.580]   of fullness or a feeling as if they had enough food
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:17.820]   to quell off hunger was also related
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.460]   to whether or not they thought they had consumed
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:21.140]   the higher calorie indulgent shake
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   or the lower calorie sensible shake.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.680]   There are a bunch of other interesting aspects
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.820]   to this study.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.420]   I'm just giving you a cursory overview of the major effects,
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.400]   but the takeaway is very straightforward.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.540]   What we believe about the foods we are consuming
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:39.140]   strongly impacts the downstream hormonal effects
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.420]   of consuming those foods.
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.820]   Ghrelin, after all, is a peptide hormone
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.200]   that is secreted from the stomach, okay?
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.240]   Yes, the stomach has neurons, but as far as we know,
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.400]   the stomach doesn't have a little thinking brain in there.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.840]   The stomach is operating in a very kind of crude language
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.300]   of the nervous system as compared to the thinking
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.700]   and analytic language of the brain, the forebrain.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.860]   But what's happening here is that knowledge,
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.340]   indeed specific knowledge about what more calories means
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.460]   as opposed to fewer calories,
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.980]   what the word indulgent means as opposed to sensible,
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.420]   all of that is being combined and then communicating
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.700]   with neurons and other systems of the gut
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.740]   to literally create a different hormonal response to food.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.680]   And that's incredible because the hormonal response to food
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.620]   is a very strongly evolutionary conserved set of mechanisms.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.060]   And yet this study and other studies like it,
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.500]   including the conditioned insulin response
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.700]   that we talked about earlier, you know, Pavlov's dogs,
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.780]   or in this case, we are the Pavlov's dogs.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.560]   We're the ones that can get conditioned to a bell
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.780]   or the smell of a food or the sight of a sign on a bakery
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.740]   to get a insulin increase.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:47.460]   All of that stuff that is primitive hard wiring
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.760]   of the brain and body is also being strongly impacted
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.980]   by the more let's call it sophisticated or analytic aspects
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.360]   of the wiring of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex,
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.020]   such that what we believe is going to happen
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.120]   is actually what happens.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.840]   Now, the other study on belief effects and mindsets
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.220]   and how they can impact outcomes
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.620]   in terms of our physiology relates to exercise.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.980]   And this is a study that Dr. Crum herself
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.760]   described came about because she was talking
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.620]   to one of her academic advisors.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.940]   This was before she opened her own laboratory.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.380]   And, you know, Aliyah is an athlete.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.060]   She was actually a division one athlete.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.540]   She's an incredibly impressive individual, by the way.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.020]   She's a tenured professor at Stanford.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.660]   She was a division one athlete.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.700]   She has a degree or rather a certification,
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.980]   in clinical psychology.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.040]   So she's an extremely accomplished individual,
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.720]   but exercise and athletics
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.700]   have always been a big part of her life.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.100]   And one day she was talking to her advisor
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.900]   and her advisor offered the possibility that,
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.860]   and here I'm paraphrasing from a different conversation,
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.260]   perhaps all the positive effects of exercise are placebo.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.040]   That's actually what her advisor said.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.580]   And Aliyah said, no, there's no way, right?
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.840]   And we know that you exercise, you sure get an increase
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.620]   in heart rate and blood pressure during exercise,
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.540]   but that leads to lower levels of baseline blood pressure
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.860]   and heart rate afterwards,
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.880]   after you adapt to that exercise.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.160]   And her advisor said, well, okay, that might be true,
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.560]   but why don't you go test it?
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.420]   So she did test it.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.380]   What she did is she took hotel service workers.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.500]   So these are people that clean hotel rooms for a living.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.540]   And these are very active people, right?
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.060]   They're vacuuming, they're changing sheets,
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.220]   they're going upstairs, they're folding laundry,
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.500]   they're doing a bunch of different things
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.660]   throughout the day.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.780]   And they divided them into two groups.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.080]   One group was told that doing a great job
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.340]   and being diligent is very good for you.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.420]   They were told all sorts of things about their job
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.960]   and how it was important.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.440]   And indeed, their job is important, right?
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.380]   We need people who can perform these roles
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.440]   of turning over hotel rooms and doing those sorts of things
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.320]   so that hotel rooms can be clean and beautiful
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.000]   when we arrive.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.580]   The other group, however, was told
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.320]   that the normal daily activities
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.820]   that these people were partaking in,
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.700]   the folding of the laundry, going up and down the stairs,
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.900]   pushing of carts, et cetera, was exercise.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.020]   And more importantly, that it was the type of movement
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:10.700]   that could, for instance, lead to reductions
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.460]   in blood pressure, reductions in body weight,
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.620]   improvements in lots of different health metrics.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.940]   Now, the incredible outcome of this study
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.900]   was that simply on the basis of whether or not
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.520]   people were told and therefore believed
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.820]   that their daily activities would lead to improvements
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.580]   in these different health metrics,
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.260]   reductions in blood pressure,
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.220]   reductions in basal heart rate,
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.000]   reductions in body weight.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.980]   Well, that's exactly what happened.
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.340]   People who received the information
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.420]   about how exercise was healthy
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.620]   and their work mimicked exercise
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.540]   experienced the health metric changes.
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:51.180]   Whereas people who were simply told your work is important,
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.620]   you know, it's important to do a good job,
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.500]   et cetera, et cetera,
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.900]   they did not experience the same health metric improvements.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.800]   So that provides support for what Dr. Crum's advisor
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.020]   had suggested that at least some of the effects of exercise
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:08.780]   are likely due to mindsets or beliefs, AKA belief effects.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.120]   So throughout today's episode,
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.260]   I've been talking about how our expectations and beliefs
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.180]   and mindsets can impact these really deep layers
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.780]   of our physiology, things like hormone release,
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.380]   things like level of discomfort or pain
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.720]   during a given treatment and on and on.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.900]   And I've talked a lot about the prefrontal cortex
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.940]   as critical for understanding what's happening
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.680]   in a given context and for setting those expectations
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.620]   because the prefrontal cortex, as you recall,
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.220]   is a prediction machine
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.380]   and context is important for prediction and on and on.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.660]   What I haven't yet told you is how it is
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.740]   that the prefrontal cortex actually does this.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.920]   I mean, what are these magical output pathways
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.940]   of the prefrontal cortex?
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.980]   And while I already established
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.220]   that they are not infinite, right?
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.620]   The prefrontal cortex can't control everything,
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.580]   meaning if I give you some information like, you know,
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.460]   just thinking about and believing
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:01.040]   that your left quadricep is going to be, you know,
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.580]   much stronger than your right quadricep.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.260]   And if you just keep perseverating on,
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.460]   meaning you keep thinking about that
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.700]   and looping on in your mind,
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.740]   and I give you some examples of how, you know,
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.860]   thinking about strength can make muscle stronger
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.220]   and on and on, you know,
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.220]   in the classic context of the placebo effect,
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.140]   all that expectation ought to lead to an improvement
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:22.180]   in strength and perhaps size of your left quadricep.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.620]   But that's not what happens.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.320]   Why? Or more accurately, why not?
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.840]   Well, as far as we know,
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.240]   there isn't a direct neural circuit or hormonal pathway
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.580]   whereby thoughts from the prefrontal cortex
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.140]   can impact the growth of muscles in your left quadricep.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.780]   However, there are output pathways
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.660]   from the prefrontal cortex to regions of the brain
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.560]   that are known to control very basic bodily
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.140]   and brain functions, such as the hypothalamus.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.340]   And those pathways are known to be able to change
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.000]   certain parameters of our, for instance, stress response.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.080]   So blood pressure, heart rate, vasoconstriction,
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.740]   even body temperature.
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.920]   So I just want to take a moment and describe
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.740]   what I consider one of the more beautiful studies
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.620]   illustrating a specific pathway
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.740]   from the prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:13.860]   that allows control of the so-called stress response
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.800]   in the context of very specific psychological stressors.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.820]   Now, this paper is important,
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:21.240]   not just for our discussion of placebo belief
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.160]   and mindset effects, but also for any discussion
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.640]   about so-called psychosomatic effects,
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.900]   or the idea that our modes of thinking,
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.840]   whether or not they are related to calmness or to stress,
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.660]   can strongly impact our physical health.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.700]   And the title of the paper is
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.900]   a central master driver of psychosocial stress responses
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.860]   in the rat.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.180]   Goodness, that's a tongue twister.
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.100]   Psychosocial stress responses in the rat.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.340]   Now, the fact that this study was performed in the rat
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.940]   should not cause us to lean away from it
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.660]   or to think that it's not relevant to humans,
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.660]   because the very same circuitries that are described
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.820]   within this study have analogous circuitries
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.040]   within the human brain.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.500]   I know that to be true from my work in neuroanatomy,
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.300]   teaching neuroanatomy, and other groups,
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.420]   separate from the group that did this study,
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.340]   have explored similar circuitries in the human brain.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.720]   Now, in this study, what they were able to do
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.440]   was to identify these two particular regions,
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.500]   which I'll just call them DPDTT for short.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.460]   So instead of saying dorsal peduncular cortex
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.980]   and dorsal tinea tecta, so just say DPDTT.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.120]   This is this area of the prefrontal cortex.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.940]   Okay, don't let these acronyms and names scare you.
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.000]   These are just names of a little sub-region
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.320]   within the prefrontal cortex.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.040]   Send connections, little wires that we call axons,
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:42.240]   to a area of the brain called the dorsomedial hypothalamus.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.140]   The dorsomedial hypothalamus
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.420]   is a highly conserved structure,
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.980]   meaning whether or not you look in mouse or in rat
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.200]   or in apes or in humans or in dogs.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.260]   The dorsomedial hypothalamus contains neurons
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.540]   that are involved in generating cardinal features
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.420]   of the stress response, things like increased blood pressure,
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:01.300]   things like increased vasoconstriction,
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.660]   things like increased body temperature,
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.440]   things like increased brown fat thermogenesis.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.060]   Now, we can even go a step further,
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.500]   because that's what they did in this study.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.920]   They mapped the connections from these specific sub-regions
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.880]   of the prefrontal cortex, the DPDTT,
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.960]   down to the dorsomedial hypothalamus
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.620]   and a very specific set of neurons
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.760]   within the dorsomedial hypothalamus.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.000]   But even there, we're still in the brain.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.660]   We haven't yet established how activation
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.860]   of these specific neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.300]   actually change blood pressure,
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.820]   how they actually cause vasoconstriction in the periphery,
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.100]   'cause that's what happens when you get very stressed.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.560]   Whether or not it's from social stress or from cold water,
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.400]   there's a constriction, what we call vasoconstriction,
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.420]   in the periphery, right?
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.260]   Blood is shuttled toward the core of the body
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.640]   to keep your core organs alive.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.500]   You're still going to get blood to the big limbs
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.180]   of your body, so you can move, run if you need to,
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.340]   but your digits, your appendages are going to get
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.760]   far less blood flow to them
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.100]   because of this vasoconstriction,
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.480]   and that's achieved by an output
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.800]   from the dorsomedial hypothalamus, okay,
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.980]   so the second hub along this chain,
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.700]   to an area of the brainstem called
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.980]   the rostral medullary raphe.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.180]   Okay, again, fancy name, you don't have to remember the name
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.560]   if you don't want to, maybe you aficionados want to,
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.180]   but what we're doing here is we're moving
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.680]   from the prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus,
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.840]   then to the brainstem, and then from the brainstem
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.700]   out to what we call the periphery, to the body,
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.380]   to the spinal cord, to the blood vessels themselves,
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:31.620]   to the organs of the body, like the gut and the heart
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.940]   and the lungs, all the things that we associate
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:36.100]   with the so-called stress response.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.160]   So as we've been learning about placebo effects
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.000]   and belief effects and mindset effects and learning that,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.580]   okay, just our knowledge about something, our anticipation,
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.500]   our thinking can influence levels of a hunger hormone,
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.420]   isn't that wild, or can influence the amount of pain
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.640]   that we experience in response to a cancer treatment,
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.720]   or can change the amount of dopamine in the brain
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.600]   in the context of a placebo given to people with Parkinson's,
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.880]   well, all of that seems very, very surprising
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.900]   until you look at studies of the sort
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.220]   that I've been describing in the last few minutes
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.400]   that are starting to establish
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.640]   the very precise neural circuitries
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.500]   that lead from areas of the brain,
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.080]   like the prefrontal cortex that are associated with thought
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.480]   and context and planning and prediction,
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.580]   down to, I don't want to call them the deeper
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.860]   or more primitive layers of the brain,
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:26.980]   because these areas like the hypothalamus
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.140]   and the medulla, the brainstem,
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.680]   they're not really primitive in the sense
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.420]   that they do very sophisticated things,
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.640]   it's just that they tend to be present
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.420]   in both mammals and reptiles, they're present in fish,
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.060]   whereas the prefrontal cortex is a brain structure
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:46.760]   that has undergone fairly significant elaboration
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.720]   as you move from animals like say cats, dogs,
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.260]   up to great apes and to humans,
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.260]   and at least to our knowledge as a field
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.180]   of neuroscientists and biologists,
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.380]   humans have the most sophisticated
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:03.560]   or rather elaborate prefrontal cortex,
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.820]   the most number of different sub areas
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:06.820]   of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.060]   and every time there's an investigation of those sub areas,
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.060]   what they do, what their anatomies are,
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.060]   meaning where they connect to and who connects back to them,
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.400]   it's found that there is a tremendous degree of specificity,
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.840]   all of which is to say that we shouldn't be surprised at all
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.940]   that these placebo belief and mindset effects occur,
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:28.380]   because there's a clear biological substrate for them.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:29.860]   So up until now, we've been talking
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.640]   about the placebo effect as these incredible set of effects
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.860]   that have a real biological substrate.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.380]   There are anatomical pathways, hormonal pathways,
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:42.300]   neurotransmitters involved, and that's all true,
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.820]   but what's also true is that the placebo effect
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:48.720]   can vary in size tremendously between individuals
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.500]   and across different studies.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.120]   And in fact, this was described in the first formal study
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.420]   of the placebo effect.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.640]   In that study, it was shown that approximately 30%
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.180]   of the individuals in the study
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:01.440]   showed a robust placebo effect,
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.100]   but that the other 70% showed a less robust placebo effect.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:10.120]   And that result, meaning that variation in susceptibility
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.240]   to the placebo effect has borne out again and again
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.120]   and again across different studies.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.260]   Now, modern science has now taught us
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:18.740]   that if you look at the genomes,
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.860]   the genes that happen to be expressed
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.940]   in one individual versus the next,
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.700]   versus the next, versus the next,
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.740]   there are certain genes, not a lot of them,
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:29.820]   but there are certain genes that seem to correlate
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.140]   with certain types of placebo effect
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.420]   being greater or lesser in certain individuals.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.900]   And while there are a lot of these different genes
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.420]   and a lot of different placebo effects,
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:43.380]   one of the more interesting ones is the COMT gene,
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.540]   which encodes for something called
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.620]   catechol-O-methyltransferase.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:50.000]   Catechol-O-methyltransferase, as the name suggests,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.980]   'cause it has an ace in there
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.820]   in the context of a discussion about biology
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.660]   that almost always means you're talking about an enzyme.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.060]   Catechol-O-methyltransferase is an enzyme
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:04.060]   involved in the regulation of the so-called catecholamines.
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.620]   Catecholamines being dopamine, epinephrine,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.980]   and norepinephrine.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.520]   Okay, we've already talked about dopamine
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.880]   in the context of Parkinson's.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.980]   I've talked about dopamine a lot, frankly,
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.360]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.060]   because it's involved in motivation,
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.500]   it's involved in focus, pursuit of reward,
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.820]   it's involved in movement, as we discussed earlier.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.860]   Norepinephrine and epinephrine
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.500]   also do many different things in the brain and body,
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.460]   but not the least of which
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.940]   is to increase activation state for heightened focus,
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.900]   for increasing the bias toward movement of the body,
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.340]   and on and on.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.620]   In any event, this gene, COMT,
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.000]   catechol-O-methyltransferase,
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   seems to show strong variation in individuals
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.840]   that show strong variation in the placebo response
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.540]   to certain types of placebo conditions.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.380]   And I just mention it because,
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.020]   A, I think it's super interesting.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.700]   After all, a lot of the studies that have demonstrated
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.860]   placebo effects have shown those effects
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.500]   in the context of changes in dopamine,
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.300]   epinephrine, and norepinephrine.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.880]   So it's not without context
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.820]   that we're talking about the COMT gene,
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:08.300]   but also just as a general theme,
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.420]   the fact that there are genes
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:14.060]   that encode for specific biological substrates,
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.100]   in this case, regulation of dopamine,
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.860]   epinephrine, and norepinephrine,
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.480]   and those genes show up at different levels
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.500]   in different individuals,
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.420]   and the placebo effect show up at different levels
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.700]   in different individuals.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.780]   And now, there are studies that are starting to show
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.180]   that the levels of those genes
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.940]   and the degree to which one experiences the placebo effect,
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.440]   either elevated response or reduced response
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:35.700]   to the placebo effect,
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.340]   seem to be fairly strongly correlated.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.580]   So this again is more evidence that,
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.280]   yes, the placebo effect is based on knowledge,
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.100]   belief, expectation,
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.440]   but that it has a real biological substrate,
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.260]   just as there are anatomical pathways
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.340]   out of the prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus,
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.580]   down to the brainstem and out to the body.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.280]   There are also genes expressed in specific cells
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.700]   within our brain and body
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:02.400]   that allow for our beliefs and expectations
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.520]   that are carried through that prefrontal cortex circuitry
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.720]   to have either a greater or lesser effect.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.860]   So throughout today's episode,
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.460]   I've been talking about how knowledge,
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:15.980]   your belief and understanding about what might happen,
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:19.240]   ought to happen, or very likely will happen,
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.540]   influences whether or not that thing actually happens,
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.640]   the so-called placebo effect,
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.100]   or belief effect, or mindset effect.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.280]   And what I hope I've made clear
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.100]   during the course of our discussion
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.980]   is that while placebo effects arrive
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.380]   through our cognitive understanding
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.400]   of what might, ought to, or is likely to happen,
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:42.300]   the downstream effects, the effects on asthma,
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.740]   irritable bowel syndrome, insulin, growth hormone,
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.740]   you know, pick your favorite biological system.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.820]   Essentially, every system within the brain and body
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:53.160]   has been shown to be susceptible to placebo effects.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.480]   What I hope is becoming clear is that in every case,
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.960]   the placebo effect is a biological effect.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.060]   It's not just, you know, our thoughts tricking us
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:05.800]   into thinking something happened that didn't happen.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.840]   It's our thoughts, our mind,
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.200]   creating real biological effects.

[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.760]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.920]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.960]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.480]   for things like improving sleep,
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.320]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.980]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.160]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.900]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.360]   livemomentous.com/huberman.

[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.740]   So that's Instagram, X, Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.560]   And on all social media platforms,
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.700]   I present science and science-related tools,
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.460]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:18.600]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.520]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.640]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:25.160]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.460]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.100]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.120]   that includes podcast summaries and podcast protocols,
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.120]   which are brief one- to two-page PDFs
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.560]   that explain, in bullet point fashion,
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.260]   things like deliberate cold exposure.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.360]   We have a foundational fitness protocol.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.900]   We have a toolkit for sleep.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.140]   We have a toolkit for neuroplasticity and learning,
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.280]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure,
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.460]   and on and on.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.760]   All of that, as I mentioned, is completely zero cost.
