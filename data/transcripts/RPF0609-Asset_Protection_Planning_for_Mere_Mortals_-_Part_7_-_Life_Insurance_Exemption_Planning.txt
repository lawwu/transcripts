[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   to the point where an offshore trust may be more appropriate for you. So let's talk about life insurance. The first thing I need to point out to you is life insurance is a sticky subject to plan because it's very much dependent on your state law.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.600]   I'm going to give you a little bit of a summary of what I'm going to be talking about in just a moment. So let's get started. So I'm going to be talking about life insurance. As long as a policy does not benefit the insured, as long as the insured is not also simultaneously listed as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, there is an unlimited amount of money that can be protected from the claims of a creditor within a life insurance contract. And so it's a wonderful state to live in from the perspective of life insurance. And when I sold life insurance in the state of Florida, that was certainly something that I would love to educate clients on. But it may not be the same in your state.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:59.740]  ET

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:49.380]  ã£ã½he's procee from a death benefitt or not protected. Some states talk about cash values and say you will have to look at your state. This is one of those areas where working with a competent life insurance agent, an educated life insurance agent should help you. A life insurance agent who sells life insurance policies in your state should know those rules. Or and or you need to also do some web searches and you also need to consult with appropriate legal counsel. A bankruptcy attorney would be a good place to start. The easiest way for you to get information on your state is to search for a
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   If you are interested in what's protected in your state, pull up your computer, go to duck duck go.com and just search something like Florida bankruptcy exemptions or Alabama bankruptcy exemptions. And you'll start to see in the bankruptcy exemptions, those exemptions that will basically apply to most asset protection planning as well. And that will give you some information. So I will proceed from here on the understanding that you know,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:49.420]  , you know, the laws in your state because this depending on your state life insurance may be very useful, or it may be just a waste of time and you need to move on. The first thing I need to point out is like other forms of exemptions. Life insurance is not completely invulnerable. There are creditors who can invade a life insurance policy. The most important one would be the IRS. The IRS can and will take
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:06:19.440]  , you know, the cash value of a life insurance policy or the proceeds under various circumstances. So although you'll be protected from other forms of creditors, you will not be protected from the IRS. So just keep that in mind. But from most of the creditors that we're talking with, you want to do the IRS, we do quite a bit more sophisticated planning. I think it's worth thinking about. But for most people, most creditors will be protected with a life insurance policy. Unique thing about life insurance is when I use that term, there are a couple of different ways that money comes out and then you can get a life insurance.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:49.460]   The first way that money can come out of a life insurance contract is in the form of a death benefit. Somebody dies and a death benefit is paid. Another way that life insurance can come out of a contract is in the form of some version of a living benefit, such as a distribution of cash value or a loan on cash surrender value or basically dealing with what happens with the cash surrender value of a contract that it has a cash surrender value. Both of these are important. It's important to know that money comes out of a life insurance contract.

[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   And I leave that insurance contract with my wife as the beneficiary of the contract.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   Great news is, depending again on state law,
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   even though I die and I leave that million dollars directly to my wife, there's no trust that I've left it to, there's no other form of protection, because it's a life insurance death benefit, she may still be able to live with her child when she's a child.

[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:59.180]   Brittney: Well, I think that's a good point. When you buy a single premium life insurance policy, you give up your ability to make that loan, which, which really hurts you from a tax perspective. The rule is you generally want to fund contracts, at least so they pass the seven pay test, whether you pay premiums for at least seven years into them. Uh, and so either you have to actually pay premiums or you have to pass the seven pay test with regard to how you set the contract up. Uh, so I don't want to get into the weeds anymore than that, but a single premium life
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.180]   insurance contract still does retain a premium life insurance policy.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:27.480]   So if you had a million dollars and you were trying to move that million dollars from a, uh, from a non creditor protected status to a creditor protected status, you could do that through the purchase of a life insurance contract or an annuity contract. And so that's a really flexible thing. And unlike retirement accounts, where you're limited to a statutory maximum of say, $6,500 or $53,000 or whatever your retirement account is, you can use that as a starting fund.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   So you can use that as a starting fund.

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   and a life insurance and a big black and a lot of the insurance and when they buy variable life insurance. But I have to concede that from the perspective of asset protection planning.

[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.640]   But I have to concede that from the perspective of asset protection planning. You can use these contract types to give you a tremendous tool than to which you can put cash that is protected from the claims of creditors and has the benefits of a life insurance contract.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:33.680]   So the two things I'm focusing on, I first spoke about universal life insurance contracts as compared to whole life insurance contracts.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:57.720]  , but then the second thing has to do with what investments are held in the contract. Traditionally life insurance contracts, especially whole life insurance contracts, were part of an insurance company's general portfolio, their general account.

[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   but then the second thing has to do with what investments are held in the contract. Traditionally life insurance contracts, especially whole life insurance contracts, were part of an insurance company's general portfolio, their general account. The amount of money that the insurance company manages that is used to pay out to its own claims that it owes for insurance contracts.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:12.660]  ,
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:24.140]   Rapper from the perspective of asset protection planning can be really powerful it's not the only way that you can get protection for assets you can always set up an asset protection trust but it can be a powerful way of protecting assets and if you live in a state that doesn't protect the base contract you can possibly use something like an irrevocable life insurance
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:33.820]   thin

[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:20.780]   and
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:32:00.360]  , which is a very good idea.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:18.900]   If you want to go abroad and you can use life insurance as a funding tool for some of your activities offshore. You can purchase a private placement life insurance contract which basically can give you not only the benefits of being offshore but can give you tremendous personal control over the choices of the investment managers. You can't control the investments yourself personally but you can choose an investment manager who would align with your own personal investment goals.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:18.900]   Which would give you much more control over the choices of the investment managers. You can't control the investments yourself personally but you can choose an investment manager who would align with your own personal investment goals.

[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   It's a really thorny world to work through so I want to stop on that topic there. So let me bring it back to life insurance planning for mere mortals and I want to just give you a very simple example of how these three things can go together for normal households.

[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:16.620]   If you we assume for a moment that you live in a state that gives you good strong creditor protection with these exemption planning ideas such as the state of Florida, you earn an income, you can do three basic things with that income.

[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:17.800]   You can pay down and pay off your personal residence and that personal residence your homestead will be protected from the claims of your creditors.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:47.680]   You can fund retirement accounts, maximize your 401 contributions, maximize your Roth IRA contributions and if you want to participate in other accounts like an educational savings account, 529 accounts, those additionally have their own asset protections, but maximize your contributions to those accounts and those accounts give you asset protection.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   Number three, you can purchase a life insurance policy, especially a life insurance policy that accumulates cash value and that gives you asset protection.

[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   Now, think about three different things of how this can benefit just an average family. One, you have exposure to real estate. So you can benefit from the appreciation of the house that you live in and you can benefit from the fact that appreciation is very tax efficient and that appreciation is protected from the claims of creditors. So you can live in a house and if you can purchase carefully, buy carefully, try to get yourself a deal, if that house, if that house is not a deal, you can buy a deal, you can buy a deal.

You don't need to go and set up an offshore trust. You don't need that at this level. All you need is those three basic tools. Now I'm sorry if your state doesn't care very much about protecting your assets and giving you financial situation.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.280]   I'm going to show you how to do it.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:35.300]  ,

[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   If you can't, you can use a little help from a local trust. You can give them a little help.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   If you can't, you can use a little help from a local trust. You can give them a little help from a local trust. You can give them a little help from a local trust. You can give them a little help from a local trust. You can give them a little help.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:42:05.320]  , you can really put some cool stuff together in the way that I have just described to you. You don't need an attorney. You don't need any, you know, a lot of money. You don't need to hire expensive financial advisors. You can do it even if you're a mere mortal and you can get very strong protection. Those three tools work beautifully together and give you wonderful results. I hope that helps to pique your interest a little bit on life insurance. It's not the only exemption, but I just wanted to put that together because I think it's a little bit of a good thing.
