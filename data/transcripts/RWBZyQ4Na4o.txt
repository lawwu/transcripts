[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   government is a conspiracy of distraction, because you've got events and crises and scandals.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.200]   The most difficult thing is to keep focused when you've got so many things that are diverting you
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   from that core task. What often happens with leaders, sometimes what we do with our leaders
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.440]   is we say to them, "Okay, we're going to do an analysis. Here are your priorities,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.920]   here's how much time you spend on them." And you end up literally with people spending
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.720]   4% of their time on their priorities, and you say, "Well, no wonder you're not succeeding."
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.640]   So when you look back at your time as prime minister, or I'm not necessarily picking on your
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.240]   time, just any head of state in Western government or any government, how much of the time they spend
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.640]   is fundamentally wasted? It's not fundamentally moving the ball forward. It's like meeting people,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.000]   ambassadors, press, whatever. How much of the time is just that? Greater than 80%, 90%?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.400]   No, that would be too high, I think, but a lot. And a lot more today, because people are expected...
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:19.120]   So I have this thing that I often say to leaders, and I think this is the single biggest problem
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.160]   with Western politics today. Sometimes when my kids were younger and I used to speak with them,
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:35.040]   and I would say to them, "Work hard, play hard." Work hard, play hard equals possibility of success.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.720]   Play hard, work hard is a certain failure, right? Because you'll play so hard,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.680]   you'll never end up working hard, right? The equivalent in politics is policy first,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.120]   politics second. In other words, work out what the right answer is, and then work out how you
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   shape the politics around that. But actually, what happens in a lot of systems today is it's
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.640]   politics first and policy second. So people end up with a political position. They've chosen for
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.440]   political reasons, and then they try and shape a policy around that politics, and it never works.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.960]   Because the most important thing - and this is why I say to you about policy makers and
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   intellectual business - is you've got to get the right answer. And there is a right answer,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.720]   by the way. The reason why it's so difficult to govern today is there's so much political noise,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.080]   it's hard to get out of that zone of noise and sit in a room with some people who really know
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.560]   what they're talking about and go into the detail of what is the solution to a problem.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.120]   Sometimes when I talk to leaders about this, I find that they just say to me, "I don't have the
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   time to do that." And I say, "If you don't have the time to do that, you are going to fail,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   because in the end, you won't have the right answer." And you've got to believe over time
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.040]   that the best policy is the best politics, over time.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   Yeah. So structurally, how would you change the - it's not just the time you had to spend,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   for example, talking to the press, but also the kinds of topics that it draws attention to,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.960]   which are what statement your cabinet minister made on the BBC and some latest scandal.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.840]   Is that fundamentally - like the 30 minutes of the PMQs is not the big deal, it's the two days
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.680]   you spend in anxiety and preparation that you were talking about in the book - is that fundamentally
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.760]   the attention distraction is the bigger issue than the actual time you spend on these events?
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.680]   Yeah, I think it is to a degree. I mean, I think the other thing is,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:49.040]   you undergo a lot of attack today in politics. And at a certain level, what happens - I mean,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.360]   it could happen to celebrities, but they tend to have at least some sort of fan base that are
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.280]   constantly supporting them. But with politics today, you can often be in a situation where
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:11.360]   you're almost dehumanised, right? You're subject to attacks on your integrity, your character,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.880]   what your intentions are. It's possible, if you're not careful, that you're just sitting
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.320]   there thinking, "This is really unfair." And you get distracted from focusing on the business.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.840]   And that's why I always say to people, one part of being a political leader, or any leader, I think,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.160]   is to be able to have a certain sort of what I call a bit of a Zen-like attitude to all the
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.760]   criticism and the disputatiousness that will go on around you, because it's just going to happen.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.400]   And today with social media, it happens to an even greater degree. One of the things I often
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   say to leaders is, "You cannot pay attention to this stuff." I mean, okay, get someone to
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.200]   summarise it for you in half a page, and you read it in the morning.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.280]   But honestly, you go down that rabbit hole, you'll never re-emerge.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.020]   [END]
