[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.740]   Today, my guest is Dr. Oded Rehavi.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.200]   Dr. Oded Rehavi is a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.520]   at Tel Aviv University in Israel.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.220]   His laboratory studies genetic inheritance.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.680]   Now, everybody is familiar with genetic inheritance
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.200]   as the idea that we inherit genes from our parents,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.020]   and indeed that is true.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.280]   Many people are also probably now aware
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.800]   of the so-called epigenome,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.020]   that is, ways in which our environment and experiences
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.320]   can change our genome,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.880]   and therefore the genes that we inherit
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.080]   or pass on to our children.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.800]   What is less known, however,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440]   and what is discussed today,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   is the evidence that we can actually pass on
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.040]   traits that relate to our experiences.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   That's right.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.920]   There is evidence in worms, in flies, in mice,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.640]   and indeed in human beings,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.760]   that memories can indeed be passed
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.760]   from one generation to the next.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.880]   And that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.720]   in terms of how our parents' experiences
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.960]   and our experiences can be passed on
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.340]   from one generation to the next,
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.080]   both in terms of modifying the biological circuits
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.240]   of the brain and body,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.620]   and the psychological consequences
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.600]   of those biological changes.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.520]   During today's episode,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.780]   Dr. Rehavi gives us a beautiful description
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480]   of how genetics work.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.040]   So even if you don't have a background in biology or science,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.740]   by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.820]   you will understand the core elements of genetics
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.400]   and the genetic passage of traits
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.080]   from one generation to the next.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.880]   In addition, he makes it clear
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.520]   how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.040]   such that they are passed from our parents to us,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.560]   and even transgenerationally across multi-generations.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.520]   That is, one generation could experience something
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.180]   and their grandchildren would still have
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.420]   genetic modifications that reflect
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.120]   those prior experiences of their grandparents.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.800]   Dr. Rehavi takes us on an incredible journey
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.140]   explaining how our genes and different patterns
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.940]   of inheritance shape our experience of life and who we are.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.800]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.480]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.660]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.280]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.960]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.080]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.880]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.820]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.920]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.920]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.140]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.540]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.520]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.320]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.880]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.640]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.440]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   in order for you to be able to see clearly
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.640]   under any conditions.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.240]   Roca understands this and has designed their eyeglasses
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.660]   and sunglasses accordingly.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.600]   Originally, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.880]   were designed for sport,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.080]   that is for things like running and cycling,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.800]   and many of the features they have reflect that.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.920]   So for instance, they are extremely lightweight,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.360]   they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.160]   and they can indeed be worn for running and cycling
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.280]   and things of that sort.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.000]   However, they also come in a number of different aesthetics
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.160]   and styles that make them perfectly suited,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.760]   not just for sport, but also for wearing
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.840]   to the office, to work.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.380]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.800]   go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.440]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.280]   your first order.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.720]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.040]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.480]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.360]   Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.600]   that increases blood ketones.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.280]   Almost everybody has heard of the so-called ketogenic diet.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.640]   Most people, including myself,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   do not follow a ketogenic diet.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.960]   That does not, however, mean that ketones cannot be valuable
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.680]   because ketones are one of the primary sources
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.040]   of brain fuel and body fuel that allows us to think clearly
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   for long durations of time and to perform well physically,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.960]   which is all to say that even if you're somebody
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.120]   who's not on a ketogenic diet, such as myself,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   increasing your blood ketones can be immensely beneficial
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.100]   for cognitive and physical performance.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.380]   Indeed, that's how I use ketone IQ.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.880]   I'll take one or two servings per day, typically,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.080]   sometimes before a workout,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.160]   but most typically before doing a bout of cognitive work.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.900]   So I'm going to sit down and prepare a podcast
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.600]   or focus on research from my lab or a writing project
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.840]   or anything that requires a high degree of concentration
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.640]   for a prolonged period of time.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.720]   Ingesting ketone IQ prior to that,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.520]   I've noticed greatly increases my level of concentration
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.600]   and I can sustain that concentration
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360]   for much longer periods of time
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.520]   than if I don't take ketone IQ.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.120]   If you'd like to try ketone IQ,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.640]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.960]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.680]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.360]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.260]   with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.880]   So I've talked about many times before on the podcast,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.360]   there's a critical relationship
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.000]   between sleep and temperature
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.980]   and indeed between waking up and temperature.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.700]   That is your body temperature needs to decrease
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.400]   by about one to three degrees in order for you to fall
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.280]   and stay deeply asleep at night.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.640]   And when you wake up in the morning,
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.560]   in order to do that feeling refreshed,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.540]   your body temperature actually needs to increase
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.200]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.220]   So it's critical that you control the temperature
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.580]   of your sleeping environment
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.780]   and that that temperature be controlled very specifically
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.680]   across the night and into the morning.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.080]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.880]   that's all extremely easy to do.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.880]   You can program the temperature of your mattress
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.720]   in the beginning, middle and throughout the night
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.880]   and when you wake up.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.680]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.760]   for over a year now
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.400]   and it has greatly improved the quality of my sleep
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.240]   and indeed I know that
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.880]   because Eight Sleep also includes
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.160]   a terrific sleep tracker built directly
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.300]   in to that mattress cover.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.600]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.240]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.000]   to save $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.640]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.800]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.360]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Oded Rahavi.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.520]   Oded, thank you so much for being here.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.700]   - Totally my pleasure.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.260]   - Yeah, this podcast has a somewhat unusual origin
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.620]   because I am familiar with your work
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.540]   but we essentially met on Twitter
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.280]   where you are known for many things
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   but lately especially you have been focusing
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.580]   not just on the discoveries in your laboratory
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.860]   and other laboratories
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.140]   but also sort of meme type humor
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.780]   that relates to the scientific process
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.660]   and we'll return to this a little bit later.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.060]   But first of all, I think it's wonderful
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.860]   that you're so active on social media
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.220]   in this positive stance around science
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.140]   that also includes humor.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.660]   But today what I mainly want to talk about
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.180]   is the incredible questions that you probe in your lab
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.620]   which are highly unusual, incredibly significant
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.340]   for each and all of our lives and very controversial
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.600]   and at times even a little bit dangerous or morbid.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.860]   So this is going to be a fun one for me
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.260]   and for the audience.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.660]   Just to start off very basically
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.020]   you get everyone up to speed
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.700]   because people have different backgrounds.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.660]   I think most people have a general understanding
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.580]   of what genes are, what RNA is and so on
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.340]   but maybe you could explain to people in very basic terms.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.740]   And I'll just preface all this by saying that
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.880]   I think most people understand
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.000]   that if they have two blue-eyed parents
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.380]   that there's a higher probability
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.340]   that their offspring will have blue eyes than brown eyes.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.060]   Similarly, if two brown-eyed parents
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.860]   have higher probability that they will have brown eyes
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.060]   rather than blue eyes and so on.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.580]   But that most people generally understand
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.040]   and accept that if they spend part of their life
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.260]   let's say studying architecture,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.040]   that if they have children
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.220]   that there's no real genetic reason, we assume,
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.220]   that their children would somehow be better at architecture
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.580]   because they contain the knowledge
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.740]   through the DNA of their parents.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.360]   They might be exposed to it in the home,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.980]   so-called nature-nurture, there's a nurture in that case
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.160]   but that they wouldn't inherit knowledge or other traits.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.940]   And today I'm hoping you can explain to us why eye color
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.600]   but not knowledge is thought to be inherited
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.040]   and the huge landscape of interesting questions
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.080]   that this opens up including some evidence
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.100]   that contrary to what we might think,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.460]   certain types of knowledge at the level of cells
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.960]   and systems can be inherited.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.160]   So that was a very long-winded opening
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.060]   but to frame things up, what is DNA, what is RNA
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.580]   and how does inheritance really work?
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.580]   - Okay, so DNA is the material, the genetic instructions
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.540]   that is containing every one of our cells.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.540]   We have the set of genes containing,
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.620]   the entire set is called the genome
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.860]   and this is present in every cell of our body,
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.180]   the same set of instructions.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.340]   And genes are made of DNA
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.400]   and they also contain, and chromosomes,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.600]   they are containing chromosomes,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.620]   chromosomes is the DNA and the proteins
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.900]   that condense the DNA because we have a huge amount of DNA
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.860]   in every cell that you need to condense it to.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.060]   - Sort of like thread on a spool.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.940]   - Right, huge amounts that you have to condense.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.060]   And we have the same genome, the same DNA
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.460]   in every cell in our body.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.680]   - Can I just interrupt and I'll do that periodically
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.260]   just to make sure that people are being carried along.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   I sometimes find that even remarkable
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.600]   that a skin cell and a brain cell, a neuron for instance,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.960]   very different functions,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.420]   but they all contain the full menu of genes
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.680]   and the same menu of genes.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.440]   - No, it is amazing, it is amazing.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.580]   And perhaps it's good to have an analogy
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.660]   to understand how it works.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.540]   So this is, I hope this is not a commercial,
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.000]   but this is like the IKEA book
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.240]   that you have in every cell in your body,
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.600]   the instructions to make everything
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.180]   that you need in your house, the chairs, the kitchen,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.140]   the pictures, but in every room, you want something else.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.700]   So in the kitchen, you want things that fit the kitchen
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.840]   and in the toilet, you want things that fit the toilet.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.380]   So you only remove one particular page of instructions,
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.940]   which is the instruction of how to build a chair.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.880]   And this you place in the living room, okay.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.380]   And in the toilet, you put in a toilet.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.740]   So the DNA is the instruction to make the genome,
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.020]   is the instruction to make everything.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.140]   This is the IKEA book.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.380]   And in every cell, we take just the instructions
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.500]   for make one particular furniture, and this is the RNA.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.980]   This is the RNA, this is the set.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.500]   And then at the end, you'll build a chair.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.060]   The chair is the protein.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.180]   So the DNA, the RNA is our instructions
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.300]   to make one particular protein
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.180]   based on the entire set of possibilities.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.940]   And this is true for one particular type of RNA,
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.220]   which won't be the star of this conversation,
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.300]   which is messenger RNA.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.340]   This is the RNA that contains the information
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.580]   for making proteins.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.180]   And in fact, this is just a small percent
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.220]   of the RNA in the cell.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.220]   So we have a very big genome and less than 2% of it encodes
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.460]   for this messenger RNA.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.460]   However, a lot of the genome is transcribed to make RNA
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.620]   that does other things.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.500]   Some of these RNAs we understand
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.420]   and many of them we don't.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.780]   I think it's a beautiful description
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.300]   and IKEA is not a sponsor of the podcast.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.900]   So it's totally fair game to use the IKEA catalog
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.940]   as the analogy for DNA, the specific instructions
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.700]   for specific pieces of furniture is the RNA
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.420]   and the furniture pieces being the proteins
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.340]   that are essentially made from RNA using messenger RNA.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.300]   Okay, thank you for that.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.260]   So despite the fact that the same genes
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.420]   are contained in all the cells of the body,
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.780]   there is a difference between certain cell types, right?
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.420]   I would say, is it fair to say
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.380]   that there was basically one very important exception
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.380]   which is somatic cells versus germ cells?
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.860]   And would you mind sharing with us what that distinction is?
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.980]   Sure, so yes, every cell type is different
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.140]   because it expresses, it brings into action different genes
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.140]   from the entire collection and assumes an identity.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.020]   And so we have cells in the legs,
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.140]   we have cells in the brain, we have in the brain,
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.820]   we have cells that produce dopamine,
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.060]   cells that produce serotonin and so on.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.060]   And we can make different separation, different distinctions
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.340]   but we can make one very important distinction
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.300]   between the somatic cells and the germ cells.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.380]   The germ cells are supposed to be the only cells
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.620]   that contributes to the next generation,
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.820]   out of which the next generation will be made.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.420]   So each of us is made just from a combination
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.700]   of a sperm and an egg, these are two types of germ cells.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.700]   And then they fuse and you get one fertilized egg
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.860]   and out of this one cell,
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.180]   all the rest of the body will develop.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.260]   And what happens in the soma,
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.740]   which are all the cells that are not the germ cells,
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.900]   should stay in the soma,
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.140]   should not be able to contribute to the next generation.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.300]   This is very important.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.100]   And it's thought to be one of the main barriers
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.140]   for the inheritance of acquired traits,
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.100]   the inheritance of memory and so on.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.140]   Because for example, like the example that you gave
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.300]   with learning architecture,
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.980]   if I learn about architecture,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.740]   the information is encoded in my brain.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.260]   And since my brain cells can't transfer information
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.140]   to the sperm and the egg,
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.980]   because the information is supposed to reside
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.980]   in synaptic connections between different neurons,
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.420]   in particular circuits that developed.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.340]   So what happens in the brain
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.900]   shouldn't be able to transfer to the next generation.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.020]   Even simpler, a simpler example,
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.340]   if you go to the gym and you build up muscles,
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.340]   you know that your kids will have to work out on their own.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.100]   It won't, this shortcut won't happen.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.780]   This is something that we know intuitively,
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.460]   even if we don't have any background in biology.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.660]   And this is connected to the fact that,
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.780]   as we said at the beginning,
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.500]   every cell in the body has its own genome.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.940]   And the next generation will only form
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.260]   from the combination of the genomes in the sperm and the egg.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.620]   Even if you somehow acquire the mutation
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.020]   or a change in your DNA in one of particular brains,
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.740]   yes, it wouldn't matter because this mutation,
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.740]   there's no way to transfer it to the DNA of the germ cells
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.020]   that will contribute to the next generation.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.580]   - So despite that, there is, as you will tell us,
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.540]   some evidence for inheritance of experience, let's call it.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.460]   Or, and here we have to be careful with the language, right?
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.580]   I just want to put a big asterisk
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.820]   and underline and a highlight that the language
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.980]   around what we're about to talk about is both confusing
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.780]   and at the same time fairly simple and controversial, right?
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.060]   It's a little bit like in the field of longevity,
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.740]   people sometimes will say anti-aging,
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.940]   some people say longevity.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.020]   The anti-aging folks feel that longevity
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.620]   is more about longevity clinics, they don't like that.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.420]   Anti-aging is related to some other kind of niche clinics,
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.620]   sometimes FDA approved or a government approved,
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.460]   sometimes not.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.860]   And so there's a lot of argument about the naming,
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.700]   but it's all about living longer and living healthier.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.160]   In this field of acquiring traits
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.700]   or the passage of information to offspring,
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.780]   what is the proper language to refer to
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.220]   what we're about to discuss?
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.060]   There is this idea and I'll say it so that you don't have to
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.940]   that dates back to Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution,
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.620]   very controversial, right?
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.980]   And maybe not even controversial,
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.460]   I think it's very like offensive even to certain people.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.420]   This idea of inheritance of acquired traits,
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.760]   the idea that one could change themselves
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.980]   through some activity, use the example of going to the gym,
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.220]   we could also use the example of somebody
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.700]   who becomes an endurance runner,
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.980]   then decides to have children
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.140]   within another endurance runner and has in mind the idea
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.860]   that because they did all this running
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.120]   and not just because they were biased towards running
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.940]   in the first place, but because of the distance
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.660]   they actually ran that their offspring somehow
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.020]   would be fabulous runners.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:20.020]   Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.040]   So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits?
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.660]   What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion?
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.700]   - Right, we have to be very careful, as you said,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.920]   and there are many complications and many ambiguities.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.100]   - And maybe you could tell us why Lamarckian evolution,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.500]   for those that don't know, is such a stained thing.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.900]   - Right, so--
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.980]   - It's not polite.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.300]   - Right, perhaps we'll start with just to just say
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.300]   that we can talk about inheritance of acquired traits,
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.940]   transmission of parental responses,
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.780]   inheritance of memory, all of these things,
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.660]   and we can also talk about epigenetics
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.420]   and transgenerational epigenetics
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.200]   and intergenerational epigenetics.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.340]   There are many terms that we need
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.520]   to make clear for the audience.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   The reason that it's so toxic or controversial
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.120]   is very complicated and goes a long time back,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.440]   even way before Lamarck, so even the Greeks
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.560]   talked about inheritance of acquired traits.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.540]   Lamarck is associated with the term,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.480]   but it's probably a mistake, although everyone talks about,
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.040]   including people who studied.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.020]   So Lamarck worked, he published his book
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.520]   about a little more than 200 years ago,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.980]   and he believed in the inheritance of acquired traits,
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.560]   absolutely, but just like anyone else in his time.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.460]   Just everyone believed in it.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.540]   It seemed obvious to them that it was long before Mendel
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.700]   and the rules of genetic inheritance,
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.260]   and also Mendel was long before their understanding
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.820]   that DNA is the heritable material,
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.420]   but this happens a long time ago.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.340]   Everyone believed in it, including Darwin.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.140]   Darwin was perhaps more Lamarck than Lamarck.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.980]   - Really?
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.820]   - Absolutely.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.340]   - All right, now we're getting into the meat of it.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.480]   - And this is in the origin of the species.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.100]   It's in all of his writings.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.120]   Lamarck didn't even really make the distinction
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.300]   between the generations.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.900]   He had many other reasons for being wrong,
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.340]   but he connected the terms,
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.300]   inheritance of acquired traits to evolution,
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.680]   and this is some of the reason
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.160]   that he was very controversial, even in his time.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.780]   There were other reasons, for example,
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.180]   he rejected current-day chemistry
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.260]   and thought that he can explain everything
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.980]   based on Aristotelian fluids, earth, wind, fire, and water.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.340]   - There's still some people on the internet
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.340]   that think they can discard with chemistry
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.740]   and explain everything based on earth, wind, fire, and fire.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.780]   - And this wasn't only biology.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.940]   It was also the weather and everything.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.780]   So that was part of the reason.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.440]   But Lamarck, so Lamarck made many mistakes,
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.680]   but he did have a full theory of inheritance,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   which was a big step towards where we are today.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.200]   So he had important contributions, nevertheless.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.240]   Although he was mistaken about the mechanism,
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.760]   what he believed, like everyone else, drives evolution
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.920]   is the transmission of the traits
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.400]   that you acquire during your life
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.200]   or the things that you do or don't do.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   We talked about use and disuse of certain organs
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.600]   that shape our organs,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.800]   and eventually also the organs of the next generation.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.640]   - He sounds a little bit
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.400]   like the first self-help public figure, right?
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.600]   Well, this idea, this is heavily embedded
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.520]   into a lot of the health and fitness space
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.080]   on Twitter and Instagram and on the internet,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.800]   which is that, and it's the idea
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.920]   that we're sold very early in life,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.880]   at least here in the United States and probably elsewhere,
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.320]   which is that we can become anything that we want to become.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.460]   And then that will forever change the offspring,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.480]   either because of nature or nurture.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.680]   - Right, and this is a very dangerous idea,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.260]   as I'll explain in a second, and it led to horrible things.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.840]   This is part of the reason that this is such a taboo.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.880]   It's not only self-help.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.320]   You're helping, you're all this helping yourself.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.360]   The problem is when you apply it to others.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.760]   And this happened in a very, very dramatic
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.800]   and horrible way in the recent past,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.480]   as I'll tell in a second.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.880]   So Lamarck, this is what he believed,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   and he thought this is how evolution progresses.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.880]   And later, Darwin showed that it's really natural selection,
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.520]   the selecting of the people, of the organisms
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   that already contain the particular qualities
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.640]   are selected based on whether they survive
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.120]   or not in particular environments,
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.840]   and therefore the evolution progresses.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.000]   They become more common and take over.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.680]   This is very different, two different explanations.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.440]   The most common way this is contrasted
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.920]   is the neck of the giraffes.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.560]   This is the classic example.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.920]   According to Lamarck, the giraffes had to stretch
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.680]   their necks towards the trees to eat
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.020]   when the trees were high.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.200]   And because of that, they transmitted these traits
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.840]   long necks to their children who also had long necks.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.200]   By the way, he only mentioned this example
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.760]   a handful of times, he didn't really focus on that.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.120]   And according to Darwin, just the giraffe
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.440]   that happened to be born with the long neck survived
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.240]   because it ate, so it's heritable materials,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.200]   he didn't know about genetics, but take over,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.600]   and the rest of the giraffes that have
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.880]   different heritable materials just die.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.020]   So this is natural selection
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.680]   versus inheritance for quadrates.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.640]   There are many reasons why Lamarckism
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.540]   and inheritance for quadrates became such a bad term.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.900]   One of the biggest is what happened in the Soviet Union.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.780]   Under Stalin, there was a scientist called Lysenko
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.680]   who thought that Mendelism, normal genetics,
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.140]   is bourgeois science, shouldn't be done.
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.860]   And whoever did normal genetics was either killed
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.120]   or sent to Siberia.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.960]   And he thought that, just like you said,
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.820]   not only we can become everything that we want,
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.980]   but we can grow everything that we want
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.860]   in every field we can take care of.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.000]   Frozen field and grow potatoes there and so on.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.880]   And this led to massive starvation,
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.820]   ruined agriculture in the Soviet Union,
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.120]   also ruined science for many, many years,
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.320]   and put a very dark cloud on the entire field.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.540]   And only probably in the '80s or something like this,
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.040]   the field started to recuperate for that.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.120]   Aside for that, which is a very dramatic thing,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.120]   there was also crazy stories around and attempts
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.680]   to prove the inheritance of quadrates.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.100]   Despite the realization of many scientists,
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.860]   this is something that is very rare
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.220]   or that normally doesn't happen.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.740]   That is not a normal way that inheritance works.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.960]   And I can tell you about two such dramatic cases
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.140]   that will illustrate it.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.980]   - Yeah, please.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.540]   - So in the beginning of the 20th century, in Vienna,
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.660]   there was a researcher called Paul Kammer,
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.720]   was a very famous and also very colorful figure
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.260]   who did experiments on many different types of animals.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.680]   He did experiments on toads that are called
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   the midwife toad because the male carries the eggs.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:28.540]   And there's a beautiful book about it from Kessler
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.440]   telling the story of what happened there.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.240]   And there are a couple of types of toads.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.180]   Some of them live underwater and some of them live on land.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.740]   And these toads are different in the shape
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.900]   and in their behavior.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.560]   So of course, the capacity to live underwater is one thing,
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.680]   but also the morphology and appearance changes.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.700]   The toads that live underwater developed
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.940]   these nubital pads, these black pads on their hands
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.840]   that allow the males to grab onto the female
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.220]   without slipping.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.060]   - For mating.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.880]   - For mating.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   And the ones on land don't have them.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.620]   He claimed that he can take the toads
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.720]   and train them to live underwater,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.820]   changing the temperature and all kinds of things.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.660]   It's a very difficult animal to work with.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.780]   Eventually, according to Kammer,
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.140]   they will acquire the capacity to live underwater
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.740]   and also change their physiology
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.700]   and develop these black nubital pads on their heads.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.100]   With this discovery, he traveled the world,
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.100]   became very famous, this was just the beginning
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.060]   of the previous century, as the person who found the proof
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.440]   for inheritance of acquired traits,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.800]   despite the controversy and so on.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.940]   And at the beginning of the realization
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.040]   of how it actually works with DNA and so on.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.720]   Not with DNA, but with natural selection.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.560]   DNA came later.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:58.140]   And people didn't believe him.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.820]   He was actually under a lot of attacks,
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.140]   but it seemed convincing.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.760]   At the end, what happened is that they found
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.540]   that he injected ink to the toads
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.460]   to make them become blacks, to have these nubital pads.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.380]   So he faked the results.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.380]   And he couldn't stand up with the accusations
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.580]   and killed himself.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.420]   - Wow.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.740]   - In this book by Kessler, it's just maybe it was,
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.620]   it was the assistant who did it.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.540]   - Who killed him?
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.920]   - No, no.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.820]   Who injected it to sort of save him from,
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.540]   because the samples lost the coloring or something like that.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.140]   So it might be, who knows what happened.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.860]   - Well, in science, whenever there's a fraud accusation
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.100]   or controversy, it's not uncommon to see
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.860]   a passing of responsibility.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.700]   - Right.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.360]   - There are recent cases, there are ongoing cases now
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.520]   where it's a question of who did what, et cetera.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   Actually, I have two questions before the second story.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.980]   I'm struck by the idea that he was traveling and talking.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.660]   I'm guessing this was before PowerPoint and Keynote,
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.220]   but also before transparencies,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.700]   which actually were still in place
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.260]   when I was a graduate student.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.100]   For those of you who don't know,
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.160]   transparencies are basically transparent pieces
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.960]   of plastic paper that you put onto a projector,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.780]   and then you can write on them and do demonstrations,
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.560]   but can show photographs and things like that.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.980]   So how was he giving these talks
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.100]   and would he travel with the toads?
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.820]   - So he traveled with the samples.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.640]   - I see.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.480]   - And I'm basing this on this Kessler book,
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.640]   which is on its own very controversial.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.620]   It's more of a beautiful story than perhaps the truth.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.760]   But according to the story there,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.180]   he had to stand in one side of the lecture hall
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.880]   with his hands behind the back,
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.780]   while others would examine the samples
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.700]   and pass them around and so on.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.200]   - But he cheated, someone cheated.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.060]   - He probably did it.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.020]   At least that's what most people think.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.520]   But this wasn't replicated.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.180]   I mean, also, I don't think anyone tried to replicate it.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.880]   - Interesting, this is just a point about replication
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.940]   and actually another tragic example,
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.840]   not but a few years ago, Sakai,
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.020]   who as far as we knew was doing very accomplished work
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.900]   on the growth of retinas, literally growing eyes in a dish.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.800]   I think everyone believes that result.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.540]   But then there were some accusations about another result
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.580]   that turned out to be fraudulent and Sakai killed himself.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.100]   This was a recent, this was only about five, 10 years ago.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.340]   So it still happens.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.240]   - Yeah, it happens.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.940]   I think it's rare, but it does happen,
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.780]   especially in this very high profile situation.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.020]   - I would argue, I'd love to know what your number is,
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.980]   but I would argue that 99% of scientists are seeking truth
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.460]   and are well-meaning, honest people.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.580]   - I totally agree.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.700]   And I think that even when people are wrong,
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.380]   it's mostly not because they're evil and trying to act.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.880]   Maybe they really want to believe the results
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.040]   or there are all kinds of ways to be wrong
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.040]   and even to bend truth without just blatant fraud.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.820]   But this is, according to the story,
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.820]   an example of very bad fraud, which is, I agree,
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.980]   is rare because most scientists, as you said,
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.640]   this is also my opinion, are just trying to discover truth
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.620]   and do the best they can.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.980]   - Well, why else would you go into it?
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.740]   Because it's certainly not a profession to go into
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.560]   if you want to get rich.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.400]   - It's not the money.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.420]   - And it's probably not even a profession to go into
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.460]   if you want to get famous.
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.380]   If you want to be famous, you should go to Hollywood
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.280]   or become a serial killer because they'll make specials.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.480]   Please don't.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.920]   But please don't do either.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.980]   No, Hollywood, I suppose, for some is fine.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.980]   But in any case, okay, so Kammerer around 1907, 1906.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.900]   - This is slightly before,
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:40.200]   the controversy broke out after the First World War.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.660]   - Okay, great.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.720]   So Kammerer is gone.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.560]   His toads, with their either ink or whatever, neuprofen pads,
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.040]   they have to go back to mating on land.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.960]   - Yeah. - Yeah, okay.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.480]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.400]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.840]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.220]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.120]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.800]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.020]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.600]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.680]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   once or usually twice a day
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.020]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.440]   for gut health. Our gut is very important.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.940]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.680]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.080]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.720]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.580]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.420]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.980]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.880]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.760]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.220]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.680]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.080]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.040]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.360]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.640]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.940]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.340]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.040]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.400]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.220]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.080]   - So this is, forget about that.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.160]   We also had the Lisenko episodes.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.820]   That's a very big thing.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.540]   And then in the US, there was, in the '70s and '80s,
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.740]   a researcher named McConnell,
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.260]   who did very different experiments.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.580]   And he was also a character.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.720]   He worked on, so he was a joker type of thing,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.820]   and he published many of his results
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.020]   in a journal that he published
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.060]   that was called Worms Breeders Gazette
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.940]   and had many cartoons and things like that.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.780]   - So he started his own journal?
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.620]   - Yes.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.980]   - That's one way to publish a lot.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.160]   - But he also published in very respected journals
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.000]   in parallel.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.580]   But he was a psychologist, American psychologist,
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.900]   and he worked on a worm, a flat worm,
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.380]   which is called planaria, which is very interesting.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.540]   It's different than what we'll discuss today,
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.300]   different type of worm.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.080]   You know, worms are very common.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.800]   So four out of five animals on this planet sees a worm.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.640]   - Really?
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.460]   - Yes, numerically.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.500]   It's just count the individuals.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.860]   So we are the exception.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.860]   But I'll talk about a very different worm later.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:13.700]   This is a flat worm.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.560]   This is called planaria.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.400]   And it is remarkable in many ways.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.080]   It was also a model that many people worked on,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.000]   including the fathers of genetics,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.800]   the people who started genetics, like Morgan.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.820]   They worked on it in the beginning,
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.020]   but it's very, very hard to study genetics in this worm
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.120]   because unlike us, unlike what we explained before
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.600]   about how we all develop from sperm and an egg,
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.200]   these worms, most of the time, reproduce just by fission.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.120]   They tear themselves apart.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.400]   So they have a head and a tail,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.760]   and the part of the head would just tear itself apart
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.080]   on the tail, grow a new, the head will grow a new tail,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.480]   the tail will grow a new head.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.340]   You can even cut them to 200 pieces.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.240]   Each piece will grow into a new worm.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.080]   - Wow.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.560]   - And they have centralized brains with lobes and everything
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.040]   and even degenerate eyes.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.660]   He studied these worms,
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.020]   and he said that he can teach them certain things,
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.320]   associations, by pairing all,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.380]   I don't remember exactly what he did.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.480]   I think it was either lights or electricity with--
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.320]   - Shock them, I think.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.080]   - Which would shock them with other things.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.880]   And he could train them to learn
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.280]   and remember particular things.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.600]   - Like they might get shocked on one side of the tank.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.440]   - Exactly.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.520]   - And then avoid that side of the tank.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.340]   - Yes.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.180]   - And then I guess the question is
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.080]   whether or not they're ripped apart cells
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.980]   and their subsequent generations
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.560]   will know to avoid that side of the tank
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.080]   without having ever been exposed to the shock.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.920]   - Right.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.040]   So without ever been exposed to the shock
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.240]   or whether the new generation,
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.360]   the new heads will be able to learn faster.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.320]   That's another, the subtlety that you might have, okay?
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.200]   And this is what he said happened.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.680]   He said he can teach them certain things,
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.440]   remove, cut off their heads,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   and new heads with all the brain will grow.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.760]   And that it will contain the memory.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.600]   This was the start of the controversy,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   not the end of it, only the beginning.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   Then he said something even much wilder,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.040]   which is he can train them to learn certain things
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.760]   and then just chop them up,
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.560]   put them in a blender and feed them to other worms
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.280]   because they are cannibalistic, they eat each other.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.800]   And that the memory will transfer through feeling.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.640]   This sounds--
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.820]   - Such a dramatic feel.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.660]   - Yeah.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.680]   (laughs)
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.120]   And by the way, this opened the field.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.560]   So people did experiments that not only in planaria
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.720]   but in goldfish and certain rodents
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.320]   and did these memory brain transfer essays,
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.640]   implanting brain.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.620]   And this is back when they had an idea
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.560]   that some memories could be molecular,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.880]   could have a molecular form, which is very appealing.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.520]   It's almost like science fiction.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.120]   You can have a memory in a tube.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.920]   And like the way we think about memory normally,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.320]   which is something that is distributed in neuronal circuits
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.720]   and encoded in the strength
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.040]   of particular synapses and so on.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.920]   But the idea that you can take a memory
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.080]   and reduce it into a molecule
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.480]   and transfer it around is very, very interesting.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.120]   So this is why it attracted so many people.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.380]   This ended up in a catastrophe.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.880]   So there was an NIH investigation.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.260]   No one can replicate anything.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.720]   It was a big mess.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   Although there were always scientists who said,
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.040]   "Yes, we can replicate this and this."
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.280]   So they were in the back.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.240]   McConnell stuff was different.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.100]   Again, people thought that they couldn't,
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.740]   that there are problems replicating,
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.760]   but it wasn't necessarily, but some people replicate,
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.980]   but it wasn't necessarily about replicating the whole thing.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.220]   But the question was,
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.540]   did the memory that transfer is specific
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.420]   or is it an overall sensitization that transmits and so on?
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.380]   - Right, like you could imagine that what gets transmitted
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.860]   is a hypersensitivity to electricity
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.880]   as opposed to the specific location
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.420]   that the electricity was introduced.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.720]   Or even more than that,
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.800]   even just hypersensitivity in general,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.100]   you're more vigilant and you'll learn anything faster.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.700]   That's also a possibility.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.760]   But his problem wasn't the accusation.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.720]   It was much worse that he was targeted by the Unabomber,
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.440]   this terrorist who sent letters with bombs
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.360]   to many scientists for 15 years.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.240]   And his assistant, again, it's the assistant,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.560]   I think exploded and this is how his line of research ended.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.440]   Just recently, a few years ago,
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.760]   a researcher from Boston, Mike Levin,
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.480]   and his postdoc, Tal Shomrat,
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.100]   replicated some of McConnell's experiment
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.320]   with the cutting of the head,
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.300]   but using very fancy equipment and automated tracking.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.140]   And they could say that they can replicate
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.840]   some of his experiments.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.800]   - Really?
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.620]   And they don't open packages in that laboratory?
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.080]   - They have interesting stories.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.340]   You should have Mike over.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.860]   - Yeah, I'm familiar with a bit of his work.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.780]   I didn't realize they had done that experiment.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.140]   - They published it a few years ago.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.980]   And this is very interesting,
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.220]   but of course they don't know how it happens.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.700]   The mechanism is unclear.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.940]   McConnell went a step further than this.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.740]   And what's fascinating is that these are experiments
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.580]   that were done in the '70s and '80s.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.820]   He said that he can not only transfer the memories
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.020]   through chopped animals,
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.740]   but he can take the other animals that learned
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.380]   and break it down into different fractions.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.940]   So just the DNA, just the RNA, just the fats,
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.580]   the proteins, the sugars.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.260]   And he said that the fraction that transmit the memory
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.100]   is the RNA.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.260]   And this is very, very interesting
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.100]   because it was a long time before everything
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.860]   that we know about RNA today.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.640]   I'll soon go into my research, explain what we do,
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.680]   and then you'll see that you can actually feed worms
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.860]   with RNA and have many things happen.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.900]   This is, everyone knows this is true.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.380]   So this is why it was so appealing to go back to that
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.220]   and study.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.300]   By the way, at the time it became popular knowledge.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.940]   Everyone knew these experiments.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.940]   There's a Star Trek episode about it from '84.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.340]   There are comics books about it, books about it.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.900]   So this was very, and people were eating RNA
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.500]   because they thought that there was RNA in memory.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.580]   This was, of course, complete nonsense.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.420]   But this was, it made a lot of noise in these years,
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.500]   which is part of the reason it was so toxic
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.560]   until recently.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.900]   You couldn't touch it because it was considered
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.920]   pseudoscience, likely Senco, like camera and all of this.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.820]   So this was just something you didn't want to touch at all.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.300]   And then we go back to these studies
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.780]   about inheritance of memory or inheritance of acquired traits
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   in other organisms, in mammals, in humans.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.980]   And aside from the dark clouds that these episodes left,
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.700]   there were also theoretical problems
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.560]   of why this can't happen.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.800]   Barriers that have to be breached for this to happen.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.460]   And you can talk about many different types of barriers.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:07.440]   And you can also narrow it down to two main barriers.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.140]   First barrier, we mentioned it,
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.640]   this is the separation of the soma from the germline.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.400]   - Right, the somatic cells,
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.540]   they can change in response to experience.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.740]   The sperm and the egg, the so-called germ cells cannot.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.580]   That's the idea.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.720]   - Or they are isolated on what happens in the soma, okay?
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.000]   The man who first thought about this barrier
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.700]   is called Weizmann, August Weizmann.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.140]   This was in the 19th century.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.500]   So it is called today the Weizmann barrier.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.040]   Separation of the soma from the germline,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.980]   only the germline transmit information
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.460]   to the next generation.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.760]   And this is also called the second law of biology.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.300]   So this is very, very fundamental.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.820]   So natural selection is the first one,
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.080]   this is the second one because it's so important
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.680]   to how we work, to how our bodies work.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.620]   Weizmann, by the way, thought that if you will have
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.800]   direct influence of the environment on the germ cells,
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.840]   then perhaps this could transfer to the next generation.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   So he wasn't as strict as his barriers suggest,
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.920]   but this is not how most people remember it, okay?
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.260]   But he thought that this is unnecessary.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.000]   It's possible that natural selection can expand everything.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.040]   And he compared to a boat, which is in the ocean,
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.560]   it is sailing and it has a sail open.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.600]   So you don't have to assume that it has an engine.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.080]   The wind is blowing, you don't have to assume other things.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.960]   The natural selection might be enough.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:33.160]   So this barrier is still standing, but not entirely.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.560]   It is reached in some organisms.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.320]   We'll go into that in a second.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   The other barrier is the, now we have to understand
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.940]   the other barrier, we have to talk about epigenetics.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.140]   We have to define epigenetics and what it is.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:52.180]   And epigenetics is another term which people misuse
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.480]   horribly and say about everything that is epigenetics.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.620]   Even people from the field, okay?
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:03.620]   The word itself, that the term was defined in the '40s
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.260]   by Waddington, Conrad Waddington.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.460]   And he talked about the interaction between genes
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:15.460]   and their products that in the end bring about the phenotype
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.380]   or the consequences and how genes influence development.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.500]   Later, people discovered mechanisms that are,
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.900]   that change the action of genes, the different mechanisms,
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.640]   and started talking about these as epigenetics.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   For example, the DNA is built out of four basic elements.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.280]   These are the A, T, G, and C, right?
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.580]   And they can be chemically modified.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.620]   So in addition to just the information that you have
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.960]   in the sequence of the DNA, you also have this information
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.780]   in the modification of the bases.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.900]   The most common modification that has been studied
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.040]   more than others is modification of the letter C
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.640]   of cytosine, methylation, addition of a methyl group
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.340]   to this C.
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:08.340]   And this can be replicated, so after the DNA,
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:13.940]   the cells divide and replicate their genetic material.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.180]   In certain cases also, these chemical modifications
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.260]   can be added on and replicate and be preserved.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.080]   - For those who aren't as familiar with thinking
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.300]   about genes and gene structure and epigenetics,
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.500]   can we think of these, you mentioned the four nucleotide
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.920]   bases, C, G, A, D, but could we imagine that through things
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.400]   like methylation, it's sort of like taking
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.040]   the primary colors and adding, changing one of them
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.860]   a little bit, changing the hue just slightly,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.120]   which then opens up an enormous number of new options
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.960]   of color integration.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.240]   - Absolutely, just more combinations, more ways,
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.740]   more information.
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.600]   There are the modifications of the DNA,
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.180]   and also there are the modifications of the proteins
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.160]   which condense the DNA that are called histones.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.140]   So they are also modified by many different chemicals.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.340]   Again, methylation is a very common modification
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.440]   of acetylation, even serotonin,
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.440]   the serotonination of histones.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.280]   - Serotonin.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.660]   - Right, this is a new paper from Nature
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.500]   from a few years ago.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.440]   - Can change DNA.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.000]   - Not the DNA itself, but the protein that condenses it.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.440]   - Essentially how, in the analogy I used before
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.920]   of how the threat is wrapped around the spool essentially.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.660]   - Yes, and this determines the degree of condensation
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.860]   of the DNA, whether the gene is now more or less accessible
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.020]   and therefore can perhaps be expressed more or less.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:42.940]   This is one way to affect the gene expression
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.260]   and bring about the function of the gene.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.020]   There are many additional ways, it's not the only one.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.940]   So when all of this was starting to be elucidated,
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.340]   people talked about epigenetics,
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.320]   they started talking about these modifications,
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.120]   forgot the original definition.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.720]   And when people said epigenetics,
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.920]   they talk about methylation and things like that.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.620]   - And again, to just frame this up
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.960]   so we can imagine two identical twins,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.440]   so-called monozygotic twins.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.120]   We could go a step further and say that they're monochorionic
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.000]   or they were in the same placental sac
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.840]   'cause twins can be raised in separate sacs,
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.440]   slightly different early environments.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.720]   Let's say those two twins are raised separately.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.440]   One experiences certain things.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.860]   The other things, they eat different foods, et cetera.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.720]   And there is the possibility through epigenetic mechanisms
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.900]   that through methylation, acetylation,
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.040]   serotonin production, et cetera,
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.240]   that the expression of certain genes in one of the twins
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.560]   could be amplified relative to the other, correct?
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.400]   - So we know that even totally identical twins,
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.900]   genetically they're identical,
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.160]   but they look different and they are all different.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.400]   We all experience it.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:51.160]   And this can happen because of these epigenetic changes.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.880]   Or it can happen because of other mechanisms
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.600]   because genes respond to the environment.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.380]   Genes don't exist in a vacuum.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:01.420]   Genes need to be activated by transcription factors.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.560]   And there's a whole, there's a lot of machinery
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.520]   that is responsible for making genes function.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.160]   So we are a combination of our genetic material
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   and the environment.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.840]   So when people talk about epigenetics
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.880]   and talk just about the modification,
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.800]   they're also not exactly right.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.640]   My definition of epigenetics is inheritance,
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.240]   which occurs either across cell division
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.440]   or more interestingly also for this podcast now,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.680]   across generations.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.600]   Not because of changes to the DNA sequence
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.920]   but through other mechanisms.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.080]   I think this is the most robust definition
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.760]   that allows you to understand what you're talking about.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.880]   And then again, and then the question is,
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.720]   if this happens, then what are the molecules
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.280]   that actually transmit information across generations?
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.000]   Are they these chemical modifications
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.160]   to the DNA or to the proteins that condense the DNA?
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.200]   Or are there other agents that transmit the information?
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   And which molecules can do it?
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.640]   And I actually think that the most interesting players today
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.560]   are RNA molecules, okay?
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.800]   But before I go into that, I just want to say
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.240]   that when we talk about the barriers
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.480]   to epigenetic inheritance
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.720]   or the barriers to inheritance of acquired traits,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.400]   in addition to the separation of the soma
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.600]   from the germline that we discussed,
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.240]   the other main barrier,
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.040]   it's called epigenetic reprogramming,
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.800]   which is that we acquired our cells,
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.400]   the genetic material in our cells
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.240]   acquires all kinds of changes,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.560]   these chemical changes, modifications we discussed.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.040]   But these modifications are largely erased
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.120]   in the transition between generations.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.000]   So in the germline, in the sperm and the egg,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.120]   and also in the early embryo,
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.960]   most of the modifications are removed
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.160]   so we can start a blank slate
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.440]   based on the genetic instructions.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.360]   And this is crucial.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.560]   Otherwise, according to the theory,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.680]   it's not clear that actually true
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.840]   because in some organisms, it doesn't really happen.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.600]   We will not develop according to the species'
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.040]   typical genetic instructions.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.000]   So to preserve this, we erase all these modifications
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.160]   that start anew.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   And this is in mammals and in humans.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.000]   This is largely true.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.920]   Most of the modifications in the sperm and in the egg
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.160]   are removed, so about 90% of them.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   Some remain, which could be interesting.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.320]   So the idea, if I understand correctly,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   is that there's some advantage to wiping the slate clean
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.800]   and returning to the original plan.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.280]   In the context of the IKEA furniture analogy,
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.160]   the instruction book is the one that's issued to everybody,
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.040]   okay, or every cell, right?
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.160]   Only certain instructions are used for certain cells,
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.440]   say a skin cell or a neuron or a liver cell
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.080]   or any other cell for that matter.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.880]   Through the course of the lifespan of the organism,
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.180]   those specific instructions are adjusted somewhat.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.040]   Okay, so maybe like IKEA furniture,
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.560]   sometimes they send you seven, not eight
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.200]   of particular screws, or they send you the proper number,
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.880]   but you put them in the wrong place
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.940]   and it sort of changes the way
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.640]   that the thing works a little bit.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.280]   Once that, assuming furniture could reproduce,
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.720]   but here in the analogy of the furniture as the cell
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.080]   or the organ in that mates with another organism,
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.080]   that needs to be replicated.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.160]   And so the idea is to take the instruction book,
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   go through and erase all the pen and pencil marks,
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.080]   erase all those additional little modifications
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.520]   that the owner used or introduced to it
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.080]   and return to the original instruction book.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.560]   - Right, because if you want to bring back
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.840]   the instruction book, you want it to have all the potential
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.760]   to make all the furnitures.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.080]   You don't want it to be restricted
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:57.320]   to the ones that you made in the particular room.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   - So it's essentially the opposite of acquired traits
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.560]   and characteristics based on your,
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.360]   what we say in biology geek-speak,
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.360]   lineage-based experience,
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.800]   but what your parents experienced, right?
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.840]   In some ways, we want to eliminate all that
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.880]   and go back to just the genes they provided.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.160]   - Yes, but it's more complicated.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.280]   It's more complicated than that
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.320]   because we have some very striking examples,
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   even in mammals, where some of the marks are maintained.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.040]   For example, the classic example is imprinting.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.240]   Imprinting is a very interesting phenomenon.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.240]   The way DNA works is that you inherit a copy
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.000]   for every chromosome from your mother and your father,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.720]   and then you have in every cell of your body
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.480]   two copies, if you're a human, of every chromosome, okay?
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.940]   And then, so every gene is represented twice.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.720]   These are called alleles, the different versions of the genes.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.240]   And the thought is that once you,
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.280]   in the next generation, the two copies that you inherited
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.840]   are equal.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.340]   It doesn't matter whether you acquire them
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.120]   from your mother or from your father, right?
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.320]   There are some situations where it does matter.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.860]   There is a limited number of genes
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.860]   that are called imprinting genes,
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.560]   where it does matter whether you inherit it
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.800]   from your mother or your father.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.160]   And this is happening through epigenetic inheritance,
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.960]   not because of changes to the DNA sequence,
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.320]   but because of maintenance
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.520]   of these chemical modifications across generations.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.080]   - And as I recall from the beautiful work
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.820]   of Catherine Dulac at Harvard,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.560]   that especially in the brain,
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.920]   there is evidence that some cells contain
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.380]   the complete genome from mom
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.720]   or the complete genome from dad.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.740]   - And it can also switch during your life.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:50.840]   So her work showed that early on in your life,
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.440]   it's different whether you express the maternal
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.560]   or paternal copy than when you're more mature.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.640]   So parents and children take notes.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.840]   For those of you that are saying,
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.000]   oh, the child is more like you or more like me,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.580]   that can change across the lifespan.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.040]   And if you're thinking about your parental lineage
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.000]   and wondering whether or not you quote unquote inherited
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.600]   some sort of trait from mother or from father,
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.040]   it can be of course both,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.080]   or it can be just one or just the other,
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:22.240]   which I think most parents tend to see
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.840]   and describe in their children from time to time.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.600]   That's just like the father,
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.320]   or that's just like the mother for instance.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.280]   - Right, right.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.600]   But it's important to know that in this situation,
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.920]   the environment played no role.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.240]   This was just whether it passed to mother or the father.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.640]   It's not that something that happened
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.080]   to the mother or the father affected it.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.200]   So this is slightly different.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.360]   The question is now,
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.380]   can the environment change the heritable material?
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.640]   So it's very important to understand
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.080]   that there is a difference between nurture and nature.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.680]   And this is very confusing.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.040]   People are, it's a little subtle.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.840]   So for example, people tell me,
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.520]   I'm growing horses for many years.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:09.360]   And I just know that this horse has a particular character.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.080]   It's very different from the other horse.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.720]   And so this is epigenetic inheritance.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.580]   No, it could be just genetically determined.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.920]   Yes, this horse inherited a different set
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.960]   of genetic instructions.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.020]   So it is different.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.260]   Doesn't have to be about epigenetics.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:28.060]   Epigenetic inheritance means that the environment
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.680]   of the parents somehow changed the children.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.160]   And there are these two main barriers
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.240]   that are fears, bad bottlenecks,
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.600]   that we have to think what type of molecule
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.620]   and how they can be breached.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.240]   So one possibility is that there's really
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.560]   this limited number of chemical modifications that survive,
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.700]   which is about 10% or so.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.040]   That could be very interesting.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.100]   - Not a small number.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.620]   - Not a small number, but perhaps, perhaps, okay?
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.180]   This is one possibility.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.920]   The other possibility that there are other mechanisms.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:06.160]   The situation now in humans is that it's just really unclear
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.160]   what transmit, if it can transmit,
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.560]   and which molecule does it.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.620]   We'll talk later about other organisms
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.960]   where it is a lot more clear.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.220]   But in humans and mammals in general,
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.080]   there are many examples for environments
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.240]   that change the children.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:30.580]   Whether you need to invoke an epigenetic mechanism
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.640]   to explain this phenomena, this is unclear.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.440]   First of all, because it's how to separate
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.840]   nurture from nurture.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:41.800]   And second, because the mechanism is just not understood.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.920]   So there are classic examples.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.180]   For in humans, there were periods of famine,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.040]   starvation in different places in the world,
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.400]   in the Netherlands, in China, in Russia,
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.920]   where people did huge epidemiological study
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.400]   to study the next generation.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.700]   And so that the children of women who were starved
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:05.700]   during pregnancy are different, different in many ways.
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:10.840]   They have different birth weight, glucose sensitivity,
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:16.720]   and also some neurological higher chances
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   of getting some neurological diseases.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.720]   And this has been shown in very large studies.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.300]   - Is there ever an instance of which starvation
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.020]   or hardship of some kind, some challenge,
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:34.300]   sensory challenge or survival-based challenge
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.340]   led to adaptive traits?
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.220]   - Yes, there are in different organisms.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.400]   It could be as a result of a trade-off.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.360]   So there could be a downside as well.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.400]   But for example, there are two examples that come into mind.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.440]   One of them is that if you stress male mice or rats,
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.680]   I don't remember.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.280]   This is work of Isabel Mansoui in the ETH in Switzerland.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   If you stress the males,
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.000]   you can do it in many different ways.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.320]   I don't remember exactly how they did,
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.240]   but you can separate them from their mothers.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.360]   You can do social defeat, all kinds of things.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.120]   Then the next generations are less stressed.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.560]   They show less anxiety.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.960]   - So their threshold for stress is higher.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.800]   - Yes.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.520]   However, I think they have memory deficits
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.360]   and other metabolic problems.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.720]   - Which may be an advantage for dealing with stress.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.680]   - Could be, it could.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.200]   - I don't have any direct evidence of that,
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.760]   but there's some simmering ideas that our ability
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.440]   to anchor our thoughts in the past, present or future
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.960]   seems very adaptive in certain contexts.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.840]   In other contexts, it can keep us ruminating
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.680]   and not adaptively present to our current challenges.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.200]   - Another example is that nicotine exposure.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.440]   This is, I think, the work of Oliver Ando from UMass.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.760]   If I'm not mistaken, these are not my studies,
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.160]   but they improve the tolerance to exposure
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.580]   to similar drugs in the next generation.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.760]   The interesting thing here is that it's very nonspecific.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   So you treat them with nicotine,
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.840]   but then in the next generation,
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.480]   they are more tolerant to nicotine,
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.800]   but also to other, I think, cocaine.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.920]   - That sort of makes sense to me because, yeah,
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.520]   obviously nicotine activates the cholinergic system,
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.180]   the dopaminergic system, epinephrine, et cetera.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.300]   And you can imagine that there's crossover
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.480]   because other drugs like cocaine, amphetamine,
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.120]   mainly target the catecholamines,
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.800]   the dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.660]   - In this particular study, if I remember correctly,
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.880]   they show that this happens, this heritable effect,
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.600]   even if you use an antagonist
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.560]   to block the nicotine receptor.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.400]   - Wow.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.800]   - So it's something more about clearance of xenobiotics
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.620]   and hepatic functions that is transmitted
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.440]   and is very nonspecific.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.600]   - What I love about all the examples you've given today,
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.720]   and especially that one is, and I hope that people,
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.120]   if you're just listening, I'm smiling,
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.480]   because biology is so cryptic sometimes.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.400]   The obvious mechanism is rarely
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.360]   the one that's actually at play.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.080]   And people always ask, well, why?
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:06.920]   Why is it like this?
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.520]   And I always say, the one thing I know for sure
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.120]   is that I wasn't consulted the design phase.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.660]   And if anyone claims they were,
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.200]   then you definitely want to back away very fast.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.840]   - And there could be so many trade-offs, so many trade-offs.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.500]   So for example, we studied,
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.240]   and also many other people studied,
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.220]   effects, these are in worms.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.080]   We'll go deep into that in a second,
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.640]   but show that when you starve them,
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.120]   the next generations live longer.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.560]   And this, I think, could be a trade-off
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.880]   with other things like fertility.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.600]   So the next generations are more sick and less fertile,
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.360]   and perhaps because of that, they live longer.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:50.080]   So there could be, it's not necessarily a good thing.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.640]   - I don't want to draw you off course,
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.960]   'cause this is magnificent,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.880]   what you're doing and splaying out for us here.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.360]   But do you recall, there was a few years ago,
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.800]   it actually ended very tragically.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.520]   It was an example, I think it was down in San Diego County,
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.940]   there was a cult of sorts that were interested
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.560]   in living forever.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.840]   And so they castrated,
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.360]   the male self castrated themselves in the idea
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.080]   that somehow maintaining some prepubescent state
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.020]   or reverting to a pseudo prepubescent state
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.320]   would somehow extend longevity.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.480]   The idea that sexual behavior somehow limited lifespan.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.160]   This has been an idea that's been thrown around
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.040]   in the kind of more wacky longevity communities.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.000]   They also shaved their heads.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.580]   They also wore the same sneakers,
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.580]   but then they also all committed suicide, right?
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:34.480]   As the Hale Bopp Comet came through town.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.660]   But that's just but one example of many cults
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.820]   aimed at sort of, that obviously was not life extension,
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.880]   that was life truncation,
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.840]   but aimed at kind of eternal life
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.440]   or some sort of through caloric restriction.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.280]   That's right.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.460]   This cult also was very into the whole idea
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.880]   that by through caloric restriction,
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.720]   we can live much longer,
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.860]   which may actually turn out to be true.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.160]   I think it's still debated,
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.000]   hence all the debate about intermittent fasting, et cetera.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.660]   But also it is known that if you overeat,
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.060]   you shorten life.
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.040]   This is clear.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.860]   It's known that big bodied members of a species
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:11.820]   live far shorter lives than the smaller members,
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:14.340]   a Great Dane versus a Chihuahua, for instance.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.200]   So there is some like sort of shards of truths
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.420]   in all of these things.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.820]   But it seems to me that the real question is like,
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.300]   what is the real mechanism
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.740]   and why would something like this exist?
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:25.580]   Right.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.720]   Because infections are very dangerous in biology, right?
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.660]   Right, but very interesting also.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:34.660]   And so when it comes to metabolic changes and nutrition,
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.860]   there are numerous examples
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.260]   where you either overfeed or starve
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.640]   and get effects in the next generations.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.180]   Many of them, sometimes the effects contrast
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:46.880]   depending on the way you do this.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.700]   Again, these are none of,
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.620]   we don't do any of that in mammals,
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:54.060]   but people show that starving or overfeeding the mothers,
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.140]   all the fathers changes the body weight
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:00.140]   of the next generation and also the glucose tolerance
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:04.400]   and other, and also reproductive success.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.720]   And so the fact that there's an effect,
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.940]   that something transmits, this is clear.
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:14.020]   The question is, how miraculous is it?
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.420]   And whether you need new biology
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.520]   and epigenetics to explain it.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.020]   What do I mean by that?
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.840]   If you affect the next generation,
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.880]   it doesn't necessarily has to go through the oocyte
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.580]   or the sperm and involve the epigenome.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   You change the metabolism of the animal as it develops,
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:36.720]   and obviously it will affect it.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:41.720]   When you, for example, starve women that are pregnant,
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:46.680]   as happened during this famous starvation studies,
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.820]   the baby's already in utero,
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.720]   exposed directly to the environment.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.700]   So it's not even a heritable effect.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.820]   The baby is itself affected.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.460]   It's a direct effect, very interesting, important,
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.660]   and has many implications.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.300]   And it will be separate from the genetics.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.500]   You'll have to take it into account
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.620]   to understand what's going on.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.240]   It doesn't require necessarily new biology
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.900]   and new biology of inheritance.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.920]   Not only is the embryo affected,
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.080]   the embryo while in utero already has germ cells.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.120]   So it's also the next generation is directly exposed.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.440]   And you don't need any new biology necessarily to explain it
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.580]   and it doesn't have has to involve epigenetics
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.540]   or epigenetics, et cetera.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.820]   - It's clear to me that in the female fetus,
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.400]   the total number of eggs that she will someday produce
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.800]   and potentially have fertilized by sperm exist.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.740]   But in males with a 60 day sperm cycle,
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:47.100]   leads me to the question, do fetal males,
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.780]   males as fetuses, living as fetuses in their moms
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.280]   already start producing sperm
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.740]   or it's the primordial cells that give rise to sperm?
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.300]   - So I'm not an expert.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.860]   So I don't want to go into the details
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.940]   of exactly when in mammals.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.500]   But yes, exposure of the mother also affect
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.140]   eventually the transmission of the father,
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.820]   of genetic information for the sperm's father.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.360]   And there are also many examples
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.860]   of just stressing the father's affecting the sperm
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.320]   and affecting the next generation.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.300]   There, if you go to the F2 generation,
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.460]   if you go two generations down the road,
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.820]   not to the kids, but to the grandkids,
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.340]   then it is a real epigenetic effect
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:31.340]   because you examine something that happens
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:34.460]   although the next generation was never exposed
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.520]   to the original challenge.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.380]   So when we say about epigenetic inheritance
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.740]   in through the paternal lineage, through the fathers,
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.940]   we talk about two generations
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.560]   and when you go through the mother, it's three generations
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.300]   to talk about when you need to invoke
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.980]   some real epigenetic mechanism.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:58.460]   And there, the evidence becomes much more scarce in mammals.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.420]   There are examples, more or less convincing,
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.020]   the field is evolving and improving a lot.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.380]   So for example, now, many people use,
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:13.580]   the cutting edge is to use IVF in vitro fertilization
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.540]   or transfer of embryos to make sure that you actually,
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.500]   it's the heritable information and not the environment
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.140]   that it goes through the germline.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.820]   So this is something that is being done now.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:25.660]   There are studies--
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.940]   - You're talking about the three-parent IVF
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.740]   where they take the DNA from mom, the sperm from dad,
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.020]   and they take the DNA from mom
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.860]   and put it into a novel cytoplasm or--
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.140]   - No, not at all, you just take the sperm
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:41.340]   and transfer it and fertilize it, an egg.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.420]   - So standard IVF.
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.700]   - Yes, standard IVF, yeah.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.340]   You can do it in many different ways,
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.780]   but this idea that you separate the environment
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.540]   of the mother from the inheritance
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.080]   or the environment of the father
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.460]   and to control and separate nature from nature.
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.500]   - The environment becomes the culture dish.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.780]   - Yes, so the field is improving.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.340]   People do experiments that have a higher end,
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.820]   so more replicates and better controlled.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.820]   And there are some examples for effects that transfer,
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.220]   and it depends who you ask,
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.820]   whether people believe it or not.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.060]   Many geneticists do not believe it,
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.700]   and many people do believe it,
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.220]   and it depends on the community.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.780]   There are strong resistance for many reasons.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.380]   Some of them are justified, some less justified
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:31.380]   and are part of the scientific process and how things work,
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.740]   because it's a new, it's challenging the dogma.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:37.300]   So this is very interesting on its own.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.800]   If you ask psychologists, many psychologists believe
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.820]   that there's heritable trauma and things like this.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.540]   Population geneticists, less so.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.180]   So this really depends.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:51.340]   And I think that we are just at a point in time
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.140]   where we don't really know whether it happens
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.080]   and to what extent, and we need bigger studies.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.620]   Even if you think about normal, just genetic studies,
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.500]   where people are trying to understand the genetic underpinning
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.200]   of complex traits,
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.060]   like anything that involves the brain, pretty much.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:13.860]   We now know that you need to study many, many, many people.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.000]   So now these big genome-wide association studies,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.580]   big genetic studies involve hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:23.300]   No one did an experiment like this for epigenetics.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.500]   It's much more complicated because you need to also
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.140]   take into account the environment.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.860]   I'm not even sure we know how to design such an experiment.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   It's very, very challenging.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:38.140]   So part of the resistance to the idea
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:42.380]   is based on theoretical grounds because of these barriers
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.560]   and because of the controversies.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:51.860]   On the other hand, people really want to believe it.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.140]   People really want to believe it.
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:58.780]   Because it sort of gives your life meaning
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.460]   if you can change your biology through changing,
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.780]   of your kids through changing your biology.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.300]   Psychologically, I can understand
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.120]   why many people want this to happen.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.420]   Even Schrodinger, the famous physicist,
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.900]   so he wrote a very important book in '44.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.180]   So this was before the double helix.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:21.440]   It's called What is Life?
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.660]   This is actually a book that drove many physicists
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.120]   to establish molecular biology.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.160]   It's very, very important.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.760]   And he talks about the heritable material.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.800]   He also talks about evolution and he said,
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.820]   "Unfortunately, Lamarckism or inheritance of acquired traits
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.200]   "is untenable, it doesn't happen."
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.720]   And he writes, "This is very, very sad or unfortunate
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.600]   "because unlike Darwinism or natural selection,
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.160]   "which is gloomy, it doesn't matter what you do,
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.840]   "the next generation will be born based on the instruction
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.120]   "in the sperm and the egg."
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.080]   You can't influence it.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.180]   Of course, you can give your kids money and education,
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.140]   but you can't biologically influence it.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:00.040]   - You can also, one thing I'm fascinated by
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.520]   for a number of reasons is partner selection.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.060]   I mean, in some ways, we think,
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.960]   oh, we want to find someone who is kind.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.320]   That does seem to be, by the way, the primary feature,
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.360]   at least in the data, tell us.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.560]   We had David Boss on the podcast
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.880]   of how women select men, that people are kind.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.080]   There's also resource potential.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.260]   There's also beauty or aesthetic attractiveness
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:22.980]   in males and females, et cetera, male, male, female, female,
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.720]   as the case may be, but in terms of reproduction,
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.680]   sperm, egg, male, female, obviously.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.940]   So we're selecting for a number of traits,
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.800]   but presumably subconsciously,
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.860]   we are also selecting for a number of traits
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.200]   related to vigor and in the idea
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.020]   that if we were to have offspring with somebody,
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.060]   that those traits would be selected for.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:45.560]   - Right, and we actually have work on that in nematodes
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.160]   that I'll be happy to tell you about in a second
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.000]   after we-
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.680]   - The dating behavior?
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.140]   - The dating and worms, and where we understand
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:56.300]   the mechanism, and we'll go into that in a second,
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:59.180]   or in a few minutes after we dive into the worms.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.800]   But yes, the original calculations
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.380]   of how population genetics work,
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.240]   to simplify things, and to do the math,
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.960]   so it would be as if it was random mating.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.520]   Of course, it doesn't work like that.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.560]   So it complicates things, because we know.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:17.640]   And there's research about potential capacity
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.960]   to somehow sense immune compatibility
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.540]   and things like this, which is, I don't know,
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.640]   I'm not an expert on that, but yeah.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.600]   - Neither am I, but my understanding is that of course,
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.960]   we're familiar with the other traits we select for,
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.260]   like potential nurturing ability,
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.640]   whether or not someone is reliable,
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.620]   predicts something about their nurturing ability,
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.000]   and for offspring potentially.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.920]   I mean, you can draw lines between these things
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.640]   without any direct evidence,
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.200]   but they seem so logical, right?
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.240]   That somebody kind who might also stick around
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.040]   or be honest in these kinds of things that it makes sense.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.220]   But that one would be selecting
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.680]   for certain biological traits like immune function
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.440]   or some other form of robustness that we're not aware of
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.640]   is I think a fascinating, fascinating area of biology.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:03.440]   - Yeah, so this is where the work in mammals stands.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.720]   However, there's also one additional thing to mention,
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.720]   which is that on top of chemical modifications to the DNA
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.760]   and the proteins that condense the DNA,
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.160]   which are called histones,
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.360]   there are also other mechanisms
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.160]   that might transmit information,
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.200]   including transmission between generations of RNA.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.480]   And there are different types of RNA,
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.440]   not just the RNA that we mentioned before,
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:34.440]   the messenger RNA, which encodes for the information
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440]   for making protein,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.080]   but also other RNAs that regulate gene expression.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.400]   And this is, and I think that in recent years,
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.640]   also in the mammalian field,
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.820]   RNA as the molecule that has the potential
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:51.440]   to transmit information between generation took center stage.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.240]   So I think this is the cutting edge,
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.760]   a lot more to understand than no,
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.660]   but RNA has a lot of potential for doing that,
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.120]   as we'll explain soon, but we have to go to worms first.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.680]   - I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.520]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.800]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.480]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.040]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.600]   to help you better understand your body
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.480]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.780]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.740]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.080]   that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.220]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.940]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:31.060]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.680]   is that most of the time it does not come back
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.280]   with any information about what to do
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.540]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.400]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.840]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.300]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.440]   becomes very straightforward
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.400]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.420]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.160]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.320]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.200]   that are optimal for you, your vitality,
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.320]   and your longevity.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.080]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.560]   of apolipoprotein B, so-called APOB,
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.720]   in their ultimate plan.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.360]   APOB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.140]   and therefore there's extreme value
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.140]   to knowing your APOB levels.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.540]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.280]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.600]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.780]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.820]   - Thank you for that incredible overview of genetics,
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.220]   and RNA, and epigenetics,
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.240]   and was essentially a survey of this very interesting,
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.880]   and on the face of it, a complex field,
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:36.540]   but you've simplified it a great deal for us.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.640]   In our transition to talking about worms,
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.640]   I would like to plant a flag in the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.880]   and say that what we are about to discuss
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.080]   is the first time that anyone on this podcast
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.600]   has discussed so-called model organisms.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.120]   I may have mentioned a fly paper here or there,
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.160]   or a study on honeybees, and caffeine,
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.640]   and flower preference at one point,
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.060]   but typically that's done in passing,
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.280]   and we quickly rotate to humans.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.620]   I know that many, if not most of our listeners,
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.540]   are focused on humans, and human biology,
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.820]   and health, et cetera,
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.400]   but I cannot emphasize enough
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.700]   the importance of model organisms,
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.720]   and the incredible degree to which they've informed us
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.620]   about human health, especially when it comes
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.740]   to very basic functions in cells, right?
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.140]   I mean, one could argue, okay,
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.020]   and there's been some debate, telomeres in mice,
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.160]   did that really lead to the same sort of data in humans?
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.920]   Okay, there are those cases, certainly,
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.900]   but model organisms are absolutely critical,
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.280]   and have been, and basically inform
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.100]   most of what we understand about human health.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.760]   So before we start to go into the description
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.200]   about worms, per se, could you just explain
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.820]   to a general audience what a model organism is, right?
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.300]   They're not modeling, they're not posing
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:52.000]   for photographs, obviously, what that means,
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.560]   and what some of the general model organisms are,
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.960]   and why you've selected or elected
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.160]   to work on a particular type of worm
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.060]   to study these fascinating topics
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.880]   that there's zero question,
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.380]   also take place in humans at some level.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.300]   - So it's a real pleasure and an honor
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.020]   to represent the model organisms here.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.800]   I'm really happy just for that, it was worth it,
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.840]   because as you said, model organisms
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.260]   are extremely important, and we learned so much
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.500]   about biology through them.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.660]   The model organisms mean that it's an organism
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.220]   that many people work on, so there's a community
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.060]   of people that work on it.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.380]   People study many types of organisms,
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.700]   but not around every organism, there's a huge community
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.380]   of researchers that combine sources
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.100]   to create all the resources and the tools
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.880]   and the understanding that accumulates.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.580]   There is just a handful of model organisms
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:55.100]   in the short history of the field of biology,
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.300]   it's not so long.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.860]   We learned about every aspect of biology through them,
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:03.380]   including many important diseases, human diseases,
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.700]   and these are E. coli bacteria, phage,
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.580]   which is a virus of bacteria, flies,
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:18.220]   worms that are called C. elegans nematodes,
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.500]   this is what we study in the lab,
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.120]   fish which are called zebrafish.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.980]   It's a particular-- - It's Danyo danyo.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.780]   - Right, and of course there are also model organisms,
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.780]   other, and mouse, and also plants, important plants,
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.540]   the most in studies, one is the Arabidopsis.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.180]   - Yeah, and perhaps less so nowadays,
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.900]   but non-human primates, macaque monkeys,
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.780]   marmosets, squirrel monkeys, mainly.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.900]   - These, I don't know exactly how the definition is,
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.700]   but emerging model organisms, there are many model organisms
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.620]   that are emerging and there are communities that are formed,
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:54.320]   including also around the planaria that we mentioned before,
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.020]   this flatworm that regenerates,
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.220]   this is a great model for studying regenerations.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.900]   If we could develop new heads, it would be incredible.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.420]   And we can learn from these organisms.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.380]   And the reason that we can learn a lot also about humans
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:08.420]   by studying these animals is that we all evolve
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.060]   from the same ancestor.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:16.060]   So we share a lot of our functions with them,
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.780]   and also a lot of our genes.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:23.060]   C. elegans, and they have, the different model organisms
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.940]   have different advantages that serve us.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:29.540]   They sometimes have some things
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.820]   that are much more apparent in them that we can study.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.660]   For example, learning and memory was largely studied
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.640]   in the beginning in a snail, a plesia,
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.820]   where many of the discoveries were made
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:41.820]   because it has big noir ones
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.020]   that you can easily study and examine.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.860]   - And yes, snails learn.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.820]   - Yes, they learn.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:52.620]   Even C. elegans, these nematodes that we study, learn,
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.900]   and they are much simpler than,
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.860]   another important reason to study them, of course,
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.300]   is you can actually experiment on them.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.900]   We can't do this to humans,
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.700]   the things that we do to these animals,
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.720]   and we can change their genes,
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.060]   do all kinds of things for them.
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.540]   - And in some, sorry to interrupt, but in some cases,
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.780]   I think you're going to tell us, for instance,
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.300]   in C. elegans in particular,
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.300]   the presence of particular cell types is so stereotyped
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.740]   that you can look at several different worms and you can,
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.100]   the community of people that study C. elegans
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.860]   has literally numbered and named each neuron
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.660]   so that two laboratories on opposite sides of the world
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:31.620]   can publish papers on the same neuron,
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.780]   knowing that it's the same neuron
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.340]   in the two different laboratories,
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.720]   something that is extremely hard to do
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.260]   in any mammalian model, mouse or certainly in humans,
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:46.080]   and has posed huge challenges that give great advantages
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.180]   to studies of things like C. elegans.
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:51.820]   - Yeah, so C. elegans, this is the star now of what,
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.740]   and this is what we study.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.540]   These are nematodes, small worms, round worms,
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.980]   that are just one millimeter long,
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.500]   so you can't see them with a naked eye.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.940]   You have to look under the scope.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.140]   - Where do they live in the natural world?
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:09.020]   - So they used to call them soil nematodes,
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.600]   but this is not really true.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.160]   They are in many places,
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.300]   but they're mostly in rotten fruits and leaves,
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.320]   and you can find them in the ground as well,
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.420]   but you can also find them, and there are free living,
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.680]   so they're not parasites,
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.160]   but you can sometimes also find them in snails, okay?
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.060]   But the best way to isolate them is from rotten fruits.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.420]   - Okay, I like the idea that they're not parasites.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.000]   I'm one of these people that gets a little squeamish
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.320]   about the notion of parasites.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.840]   - Yeah, so they're not parasites.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.040]   They're really fun to handle
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.200]   because they're so small and easy.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.300]   You just grow them on plates with agar and E. coli bacteria.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.860]   This is what they eat in the lab.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:46.860]   You can just pick them with a small wire pick,
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:51.740]   and move them around, and change their genes,
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:52.580]   and do many things for them,
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.700]   but they have many advantages for neuroscience
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.920]   and for studying inheritance.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.740]   As you mentioned, they have always
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.860]   a certain number of cells in the body,
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:07.440]   so a C. elegans nematode always has 959 cells in its body.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.280]   That's it, okay?
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.420]   - Not 960, not 958.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:15.420]   - 959, okay, and out of which 302 are neurons.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.940]   Always 302.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.720]   There's a huge debate now over Twitter
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.220]   on whether it's 302 or 300.
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.400]   I mean, I don't want to get into trouble, okay,
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.740]   but people take this very, very hard.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.700]   I think it's 302, but let's not get into it
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.700]   because I'll get into trouble.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:36.300]   - Well, we can equilibrate all things here by you say 302.
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.640]   Granted, you're far more informed in this model organism
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.840]   than I am or ever will be.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.260]   I'll say 300, and then we're balanced
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.900]   in terms of partisan politics and the C. elegans community.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:46.740]   - Perfect.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:50.820]   - And it's always the same, and each neuron has a name,
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:55.020]   like you said, and not only does every neuron has a name,
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.940]   many of them, we know what they do.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.820]   So there's a few cells that are sensory neurons
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.900]   that sense particular chemicals.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.420]   In certain situations, we know that a chemical
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.620]   will be sensed just by one neuron.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:10.340]   There are the motor neurons and internal neurons
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.220]   and all of that.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.760]   We know how many dopamine neurons they are
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.700]   and serotonin neurons, and we know them all by their name.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.620]   Not only that, we know how they are connected
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.820]   to one another.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.980]   We have a map, a connectome, since the '80s,
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.740]   like a subway map that tells us which neuron
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:30.200]   talks with which other neurons, and it is the same, okay?
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.260]   It was used to, people thought that it was exactly
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.780]   the same between genetically identical worms.
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:37.180]   Now we know that there are slight differences,
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.260]   but by and large, it is the same, and we have a map,
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.100]   a roadmap that we can use to study.
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.260]   - The so-called connectome.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.100]   - The connectome.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.740]   Not only that, the worms are transparent,
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:50.420]   so we can actually see the neurons fire
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.980]   using particular tools.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.780]   And we can activate genes and silent genes
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:59.380]   using optogenetics, like I was discussing on the podcast.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.740]   We can make the worms go forward or backward
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:07.740]   or lay an egg by shining different waves of light on them.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:11.420]   And so we have very powerful tools
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.460]   for manipulating the brain.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:17.580]   On top of that, we have great understanding
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.860]   of the genetics of the worm, of the genome.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.260]   This is, coelacans is the first animal
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:27.340]   to have its genome sequenced before humans.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.700]   Before that, of course, there were bacteria, but.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.420]   And we know that in each worm produced,
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:37.020]   each mother produces about 250 babies,
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.020]   which are almost genetically identical.
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:44.140]   So we can, and we know where we grow them.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.860]   The environment is very controlled.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.940]   So we grow them in the plate with just bacteria.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:52.380]   So we can easily separate between nature and nurture.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:55.340]   - And one thing that I wonder about often
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.900]   is generation time.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.140]   Even though mice are not humans,
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.460]   mice have certain advantages
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:01.780]   because they're mammalian species.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.420]   You can't do all the magnificent things
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.980]   that you can do in coelacans in mice,
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:07.940]   but one major issue with mice
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.340]   is that the generation time is somewhat long.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.060]   You pair two mice, they mate,
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:14.660]   you get a mouse or litter of mice 21 days later.
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.940]   It might seem like, okay, that's only 21 days or so.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:21.460]   But if you are a graduate student or postdoc
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:22.980]   trying to do a project, I mean,
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.420]   that can extend the time to do experiments
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.220]   out three or four years
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:28.660]   compared to what you could do in coelacans.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:29.540]   - You're absolutely right.
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.420]   This is one of the major advantages.
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:35.100]   The generation time in coelacans is three days, three days.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.980]   So you can do hundreds of worm generations in one PhD.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:40.260]   This is very important.
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.300]   Not only that, every worm will produce
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.340]   hundreds of progenies that are genetically identical,
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.700]   so you will have great statistics for your experiment.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.140]   - And the worms probably don't mind
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.740]   living on these agar plates, you know,
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.140]   munching away on E. coli, where--
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:53.980]   - It's the good life.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.020]   - You know, it's questionable whether or not mice are,
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:00.820]   certainly, listen, I'm a proponent of well-controlled
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.700]   and as long as there's oversight animal research,
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.780]   it's necessary for the development of treatments
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:08.420]   of diseases that hinder humans.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.780]   But it is always a little bit of a kind of a cringe and go
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.300]   kind of thing when you're dealing with mammals
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.260]   that are living so far outside their natural environment.
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.300]   I'd be lying if I didn't say
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.780]   that it gets to you after a while,
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.620]   and if it doesn't get to you,
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.860]   you kind of have to wonder about your own psyche a bit.
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.060]   - Right, I also think that this is important,
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.660]   but for me, it's much easier to work on worms.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:32.420]   I don't have to, you know, feel bad about it.
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.740]   - Yeah, they're happy.
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:38.180]   - They're happy, and you also, I mean, if a worm dies,
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.860]   it's less painful to the human
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:43.540]   than if other more sensitive animals.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.820]   - Yeah, I would argue yes, I agree, yeah.
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.700]   - So yes, so there are many advantages
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.580]   for studying C. elegans.
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:55.580]   And in the worm, we now have very obvious
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.980]   and clear cut proof that there is inheritance
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:03.180]   of acquired traits, so much so that I don't think
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.540]   that anyone pretty much in the epigenetic field
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:07.940]   argues against it.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:10.380]   - Well, and in large part, thanks to you
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.340]   and the work you've done.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:14.060]   So could you tell us what was the first experiment
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:18.180]   that you did on C. elegans that confirmed for you
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:21.260]   that there is inheritance of acquired traits?
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.180]   Because of course, the best experiments
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:27.060]   and experimenters always set out to disprove
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:30.340]   their hypothesis, and when the hypothesis survives,
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:33.260]   despite all the control experiments and poking
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:37.660]   and prodding and attempts to contradict oneself,
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.420]   then it's considered a victory.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.860]   But it's one that we all have to be very cautious
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:44.620]   about enjoying because of the tendency
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.780]   to want our hypotheses to be true.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:49.700]   So what was the first experiment where you were convinced
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:52.540]   that inheritance of acquired traits is real?
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:57.220]   - The first experiment I did was when I, in my postdoc,
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.620]   which I did with Oliver Hobart in University of Columbia,
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:07.060]   we set to test whether worms can produce
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.140]   transgenerational for multiple generation resistance
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.660]   to viruses.
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:14.580]   - Oh wow, this is a very pertinent topic.
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:16.460]   - Which is relevant to you.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:20.700]   And worms, these worms don't have dedicated immune cells
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.900]   like we do, they don't have T-cells or B-cells.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:26.460]   They defend themselves from viruses
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:29.620]   very efficiently using RNA.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.620]   So in fact, when we started these experiments,
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:34.460]   there wasn't any natural virus that was known
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.580]   to infect C. elegans, which is amazing.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.700]   'Cause viruses are very good,
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.940]   as we all experience now in infecting.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:44.060]   And the worms are resistant to viruses
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.620]   because of RNA molecules, short RNA molecules
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:50.020]   that destroy viruses.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:54.180]   And these are called small RNAs.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:57.060]   Now we need to discuss them before I explain my experiment.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:03.700]   In 2006, two researchers that were studying C. elegans,
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:08.460]   Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, got the Nobel Prize
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.220]   for showing that there is a mechanism that regulates genes
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:16.220]   that happens through small RNAs.
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:20.900]   What they've shown is that if you inject the worms
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:25.140]   with RNA molecules, which are double-stranded,
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:30.020]   they lead to the site, they shut off the genes
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.180]   that correspond, that match in sequence to this RNA.
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:36.900]   - So it's sort of like taking the specific instructions
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.580]   for the coffee table from your IKEA handbook,
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:45.100]   and you insert a copy of that into the book.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:49.100]   And in doing so, you prevent the expression of,
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.620]   sort of erase the original page.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:53.100]   - Perfect explanation, perfect explanation.
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:56.420]   And they found that double-stranded RNA,
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:00.620]   RNA that has two strands, is what starts the response,
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:03.180]   leading to the production of small RNA molecules,
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:06.220]   which are the ones that actually find the messenger RNA
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.980]   and leads to destruction.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:10.660]   Silence it so you don't get proteins in the end.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.940]   For that, they got the Nobel Prize
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.580]   after people found that this is conserved
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:16.620]   in many organisms, including humans.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.220]   And now there are now drugs.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:21.260]   This was only in 2006 that the Nobel Prize paper
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.660]   was published in '98.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:27.340]   There are now drugs that use this mechanism also in humans.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:29.260]   - And I'll just interject and say that not only
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.740]   is it a recent discovery and an incredibly important one,
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:35.780]   but Andy Fire and Craig Miller are also really nice people.
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:36.620]   - Yeah.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:37.780]   - They just happen to be very nice people.
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.700]   And Craig Miller is an excellent,
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.380]   I think he's a kite surfer.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.940]   When I, the only time I met him in person was at a meeting
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:46.260]   and he had a black eye and I thought, okay, wow,
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.220]   I guess he's also a pugilist or something,
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.580]   but turns out he had done that kite surfing.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.220]   So scientists actually do things other than
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:58.620]   go to the laboratory, Nobel Prize winning scientist that is.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.980]   Okay, I'll let you continue.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:00.820]   Thanks for allowing me that.
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.020]   - Yeah, incredible scientists.
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:05.900]   And there were also studies in many organisms
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.220]   on the mechanisms of how this happens.
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:11.220]   It is called RNA interference.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.300]   RNA interferes in the expression of a gene
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.780]   in the function of a gene.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:18.020]   And it's also called gene silencing
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.900]   because these RNAs enforce the silencing of genes
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:22.940]   instead of the genes being expressed,
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.140]   they are silenced and you don't manifest the function.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.980]   Already in the first paper that they published about this,
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.980]   where they've shown the double-strand RNA
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.660]   is what leads to the silencing of the control,
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:38.540]   they've shown two very important things.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:41.460]   One of them is that if you inject the worms
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.660]   with double-strand RNA,
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:48.740]   you don't only see the action in the cell that you injected
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.340]   or in the tissue that you injected,
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:53.420]   but you see it all over the worm's body, it spreads.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.700]   It wasn't exactly clear what spreads,
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.260]   but it was clear that it spreads.
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:01.020]   You see the silencing all over the body.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:04.260]   This includes also the germ cells.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.140]   So if you inject the double-strand RNA
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:09.940]   just to somatic cells, even to the head,
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.100]   you will get also the effect in the germ cells
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.140]   and in the next generation, okay,
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.940]   in the immediate progeny, the F1 generation, the kids.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.380]   So this was really clear proof that this is inherited.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.820]   However, this is just one generation, okay,
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:30.180]   in these original studies.
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.020]   Later they've shown something
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.980]   which will immediately remind you
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.900]   what I told you about with planaria,
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:39.060]   that you can just take worms
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:42.060]   and feed them on bacteria
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.780]   that produce this double-strand RNA,
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.980]   and that the silencing would move
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:49.220]   from the site of ingestion from the gut
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:52.980]   where the bacteria are eaten to the rest of the body
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.500]   and also to the next generation, okay?
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:56.860]   So before we left,
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.100]   when I mentioned these cannibalistic experiments
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:01.100]   of McConnell with the planaria,
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.100]   and now you see that it can happen,
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.220]   and this is not controversial at all.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.820]   This is being done routinely every day
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.820]   by any C. elegans biologist in the world.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.780]   This has been replicated a million times.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:16.100]   Not only that, you can also feed planaria,
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.660]   these other worms, with RNA.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.500]   You can just put it in chopped liver and let them eat it,
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:24.900]   and again, this will sign genes throughout the body, okay?
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:25.740]   - Wild.
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.460]   - Okay, and this is what we do routinely.
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:32.220]   We always, when we use this technique
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.100]   to see what genes do.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.340]   If we want to see whether a particular gene is important
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.860]   for a certain behavior or a certain something,
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:44.340]   the way to study is to neutralize the gene activity,
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:46.380]   and we do it by just introducing the worms
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:49.620]   with double-strand RNA that correspond in sequence,
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:51.540]   that match in sequence this gene.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.180]   This will lead to the silencing.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.780]   This activate the gene's activity,
[01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:58.460]   and if then the effect stops,
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.900]   we know this gene is involved in the function,
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:04.220]   and we never want to just examine one worm,
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.780]   so we feed the mother with double-strand RNA,
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:09.020]   and then we examine all of its children
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.460]   so we can have the statistics over hundreds of worms
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.300]   or thousands of worms.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.580]   So this is validated and not controversial at all
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:18.140]   and totally routine.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.460]   - Is it fair to say that McConnell's experiments
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:23.180]   of chop blending up these worms,
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:25.540]   the graphic image, blending up these worms
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:28.700]   and then feeding them to other worms, planaria,
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.620]   that those experiments can, yes,
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.500]   be explained by double-stranded RNA
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.940]   and through RNA interference?
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:37.780]   - Potentially.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.940]   It hasn't been done yet.
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.100]   We are working on it in my lab now
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.660]   in collaboration with other labs,
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:43.700]   but it wasn't published.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:46.860]   But yes, this could be the explanation, okay?
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:52.140]   So Fire and Mellow did these experiments.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.460]   Some other people did these experiments.
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.220]   When I started my work, I wanted to see
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:30:00.500]   whether in addition to artificial double-stranded RNA,
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:04.980]   some natural traits can also transmit across generations
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:07.100]   because of RNA, because of small RNAs.
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.140]   - Right, because injecting RNAi,
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:12.860]   or shorter interfering RNAs, that is,
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:17.860]   or putting worms into an environment
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.740]   with an abundance of inhibitory RNAs as an experiment
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:23.300]   is very different than worms experiencing something
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:26.860]   and then passing on that acquired trait to their offspring.
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:29.660]   And it's a world apart, in my opinion,
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.180]   because one is an extreme manipulation
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:33.180]   that illustrates an underlying principle.
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.660]   The other is something that in theory occurs
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:39.060]   in the passage of generations just naturally.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.540]   - We're going from the less artificial
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.060]   to the more artificial.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:44.900]   The advantages, just like with model organisms,
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.340]   that the more artificial it is,
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:49.180]   the easier it is to, you know exactly what you did.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.180]   Just now introduce one factor
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.580]   and you can follow the result.
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.540]   So this is always the trait.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.860]   What I did was, in Oliver's lab,
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:00.420]   is to see whether the magic, part of the magic
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:03.100]   for the worms' resistance to viruses
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.820]   is the capacity to transmit information
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.260]   in the form of RNA molecules, inhibitory RNA molecules,
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.820]   to the next generations.
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:13.660]   And it has been shown before in C. elegans
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:17.860]   that the worms resist viruses using this mechanism,
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:20.140]   these small RNAs, okay?
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.700]   In fact, this is probably the reason
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:24.620]   that these small RNAs evolved in the first place,
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:29.620]   to get rid of viruses and other parasitic genomic elements.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:35.460]   And this is a mechanism to fight them.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.740]   And what I did is a very simple experiment.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:41.180]   I took worms and I infected them with a virus.
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:44.860]   When you do this, this also has been shown in the past,
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:47.260]   the worms destroy the virus, okay?
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:53.500]   We demonstrated this very clearly using a fluorescent virus.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:59.580]   So if the virus replicates successfully,
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:02.060]   the worms just turns green.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:05.100]   And if the virus is destroyed, the worm stays black.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:05.940]   This is very simple.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:06.980]   It's a clear cut off.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.660]   It's not, you don't examine the worm
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.460]   and ask whether it feels good.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:13.020]   You just see this green light.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:14.100]   - Binary response.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.660]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.740]   - And so we took worms,
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:20.940]   we infect them with the fluorescent virus, they destroyed.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.620]   This also has been done in the past.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:27.620]   But then what we did is we neutralized the machinery
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:32.740]   that makes small RNAs in the descendants of the worms.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.300]   So they cannot make small RNAs from the start on their own
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.660]   because they just don't have the genes
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.780]   that you need to make these small RNAs, okay?
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:45.300]   And then we ask, what will happen
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.580]   when we'll infect these worms with a virus?
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:50.300]   Will they be green or black?
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:52.620]   They can't make their own small RNAs.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:54.820]   So they can't protect themselves on their own.
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.940]   The only way for them to stay black
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.380]   for them not having the virus replicate
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.540]   is if they inherit the small RNAs from their parents.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.740]   And this is exactly what happens.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.260]   All the worms progeny, although they don't have the gene
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:09.980]   that is needed for making the small RNAs are black.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:11.020]   They signed the virus.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:13.740]   And this also continues for additional generations, okay?
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:18.100]   - So the parent worms effectively put something
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.740]   into the genetic instructions of the offspring
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.760]   that would afford them this,
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.660]   let's call it an advantage in this case,
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.300]   but afford them an advantage if they were to be confronted
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:29.660]   with the same thing that the parents were.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:32.740]   - Right, and we know exactly what these advantages.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:37.740]   The advantages are small RNAs that match the viral genome
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:41.460]   and just chop up the virus in the next generation.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:46.460]   And we can identify these small RNAs in the inhibitory RNAs
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.280]   in the descendants, although they don't have the machinery
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.220]   to make it, just because they inherit it.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.620]   We can identify them by sequencing,
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.180]   by RNA sequencing, which is like DNA sequencing.
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.700]   You actually get the actual sequence of the RNA molecules.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.660]   And we can see that they correspond to the virus
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.500]   and they inherit these small RNAs
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.820]   only if their parents were infected with them.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.400]   - So there's specificity there.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.440]   - There's specificity.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.300]   Yeah, it's not some just general resilience passage.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.280]   I have to be careful in drawing an analogy
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.960]   that isn't correct.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.400]   And I want to acknowledge that what I'm about to say
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.440]   with certainty cannot be entirely correct.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.220]   But the analogy that comes to mind in mammals is this idea
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:27.120]   that if one generation is stressed,
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.600]   that their offspring may, in some cases,
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.380]   have a higher stress threshold, the resilience to stress.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:35.960]   I could imagine why that would be advantageous, right?
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.640]   Your parents have a hard life, they have offspring,
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.400]   and they want their children
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.860]   to have a higher threshold to stress
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:43.880]   because stress can inhibit reproduction, et cetera.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.520]   And I always say, you know, at the end of the day
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.320]   and at the end of life, evolution is about the offspring,
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.680]   not about the parents.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.840]   And every species pretty much seems to want
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.920]   to make more of itself and protect its young,
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.000]   one way or another, either through nature or through nurture.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.460]   This is a nature-based protection of young.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:03.260]   Is it fair to say that in the mammalian experiment
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.840]   with a passage of stress resilience,
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.380]   that it could be RNA-based,
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:13.280]   that that would be, perhaps, set some new threshold
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.600]   on glucocorticoid production?
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:15.880]   Here, I'm speculating,
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.600]   and I want to highlight that I'm speculating,
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.120]   but I'm speculating with a reason,
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.060]   which is, I think, for people
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.880]   that are hearing about this in worms,
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:24.200]   you've done a beautiful job of splaying out
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.640]   why model organisms are really important,
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.200]   but to think about how this may operate
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.600]   in the passage of human generations,
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.600]   I think is a reasonable thing to entertain.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.480]   - Right, and it is true that also in mammals,
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.920]   now RNAs and small RNAs are a leading candidate
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.120]   for something that could mediate the transmission
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.440]   of stress protection or also harmful effects
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.920]   that transmit between generations.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:51.400]   Perhaps, RNA do it.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.640]   However, in worms, the RNAs have one more trick
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.560]   that we don't know the equivalent in mammals yet.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.800]   This is something very crucial
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.360]   that we showed in that particular paper, in the first paper.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.400]   - Which is?
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.480]   - So the effect that I described,
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.000]   this transmission of resistance to viruses
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.840]   through these RNAs, doesn't only affect the next generation.
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.340]   It also affects multiple additional generations.
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:16.440]   - So it gets passed.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.800]   - It gets passed, and you have to ask yourself,
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.360]   how doesn't it get diluted?
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.840]   Why isn't it diluted, right?
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.520]   Because, I mean, everyone produces 250 babies,
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.240]   so you dilute by 250,
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:31.800]   and if something is diluted for four generations,
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.520]   so it's 250 times 250, after four generations,
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.820]   it's a dilution of four billions,
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:39.520]   completely homeopathic would never work.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.840]   It's just there's nothing left.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.000]   The secret of these worms is that they have a machinery
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.640]   for amplifying the small RNAs in every generation.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.520]   This is called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.520]   It's a complex which uses the RNA
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.840]   to find, and once it finds the messenger RNA,
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.320]   it just creates many, many, many, many small RNAs,
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.480]   so they don't get diluted,
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.680]   and they pass on for additional generations.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.060]   And this is the trick.
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:13.000]   We later also identify genes that regulate
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.960]   for how long an effect would last.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.220]   Otherwise, if in the beginning we ask,
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.540]   how doesn't it stop after one generation,
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:24.000]   now we have to ask, why doesn't it last forever?
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.840]   And it doesn't.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.960]   Typically we see that the responses last
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.200]   not only with the viral resistance,
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.280]   but also with other traits for a few generations,
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.680]   three to five generations.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.540]   We found genes that function as a sort of a clock
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.820]   that times the duration of the inheritance.
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.220]   - What sorts of genes are those?
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:45.280]   - So we call these genes MOTEC genes.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.720]   MOTEC, I don't know how is your Hebrew,
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.540]   but MOTEC, it means sweetheart in Hebrew,
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.720]   but the acronym is modified transgenerational
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.120]   epigenetic kinetics.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:57.460]   There are different types of genes like that.
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:01.080]   And some of them, if you mutate,
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:03.000]   if you disrupt their function,
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.620]   now the effect would transmit stably
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:06.960]   for hundreds of generations.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.680]   It would never stop.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.640]   Because their role is to stop the inheritance
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.680]   from just, you don't wanna carry over something forever,
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.440]   otherwise it will no longer fit the environment
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.920]   of the parents, and you'll be prepared
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.280]   for the wrong things.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.640]   So this is important.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.040]   What type of genes are they?
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.360]   One gene that we studied, it's called MET2.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.000]   It's actually a gene that functions in methylation
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.040]   of the proteins that condense the DNA.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.040]   So this is, but then there are other genes
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.280]   that affect also production of small RNAs.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.620]   - Is there some mechanism that controls
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:48.620]   the duration of passage in a way that logically links up
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:52.320]   with the lifespan of the organism?
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.920]   So for instance, I knew my grandparents,
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:58.760]   met them, I did not ever meet my great-grandparents,
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.280]   and I certainly didn't meet my great-great-grandparents.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.720]   I could imagine that my great-great-grandparents
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.020]   or my great-grandparents experienced certain things
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.520]   that were passed into their children
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:11.160]   and perhaps into their children.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.880]   But it seems reasonable, given that humans live
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:17.960]   somewhere between zero and 100 years,
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:20.080]   typically what now, 80 years,
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.680]   is that the typical lifespan, more or less, okay?
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:26.440]   That if I were going to design the system,
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.920]   and again, I was not consulted at the design phase,
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.160]   I would want an adaptive trait
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.200]   to be passed for two generations,
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.480]   because given the way that our,
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.860]   given how long our species lives,
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:39.640]   and certainly given the way the world looks now,
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.920]   as opposed to the turn of the previous century
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.580]   or the turn of the previous century,
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:48.120]   different stressors, different life environments,
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.600]   and what I would want to pass on to my offspring,
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.880]   I can basically hedge pretty well.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.160]   I can place a good bet on the next 100 years,
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.640]   maybe the next 200, but I don't have the foggiest clue
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.100]   what the world is going to look like in 300 years.
[01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:03.800]   Does what I'm saying make any sense whatsoever?
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.040]   - It makes a lot of sense.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.200]   And really, we need to talk about two things
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.120]   in response to this question.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.000]   First of all, yes, you can imagine that the reason
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.520]   that the worms inherit, typically,
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:18.280]   for three to five generations is that this is relevant
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.220]   to something that happened in their environment.
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:24.880]   For example, we also showed that when you starve the worms,
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.320]   it affects the next generations,
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.820]   again, for a few generations.
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.480]   - Which in itself is amazing, right?
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.040]   I just want to highlight that.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.420]   I mean, you can imagine next generation,
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:36.840]   it's sort of like a genetic version of be careful, kids,
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.800]   but I'm going to give you this extra lunch pack
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.440]   in your genome that protects you
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.440]   against the possibility of starvation.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.780]   But it's also saying, and were you to have kids?
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:46.000]   - Right. - They have it also.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.140]   - Yeah, so I have to just make a disclaimer
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.040]   that we don't know that necessarily it's adaptive.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:53.200]   It could also be damaged.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.400]   As I said, when you starve them,
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.800]   the next generations live longer,
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.840]   but this could be a trade-off for fertility or something.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.600]   So other labs have also shown, following our work,
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.200]   that if you starve the worms, the next generations
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.360]   are also more resistant to harsher starvation.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.720]   This sounds, this is not our work,
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.040]   but this sounds adaptive, okay?
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.880]   But whenever you're talking about adaptation,
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.960]   you have to see it in the context of evolution.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.140]   There's also this famous saying, nothing in biology
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.260]   makes sense except in the light of evolution.
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:23.380]   And so it's very hard to say,
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.820]   without doing the lab evolution experiments,
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:28.380]   we actually see who wins, the ones that inherit
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:30.840]   or the ones that don't inherit, who takes over.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.340]   Otherwise, it's hard to talk about
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:33.540]   whether it's adaptive or not.
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:35.620]   But when it comes to the duration of the response,
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:39.500]   yes, it could be programmed to fit something.
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.780]   For example, if you're talking about starvation,
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:44.860]   worms transition between periods of starvation
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:46.820]   and periods where they have a lot of food.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:48.640]   So let's say they find an apple.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.540]   For a few generations, they will consume the apple
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:52.920]   and then they will be starved for a while.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.200]   Perhaps this is the number of generations
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.200]   that takes them to finish an apple.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.420]   Or perhaps there are other responses
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:01.580]   also to higher temperatures.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.360]   If you grow worms in higher temperatures,
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.200]   their offerings are different.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:08.060]   They change how they mate.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.940]   It's what I alluded to before.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:10.780]   - We're gonna get back to this
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.480]   because it relates to cold exposure,
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.540]   which many listeners are interested in.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:18.100]   - And perhaps it is somehow correlated with
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.140]   the cycle of the year.
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:22.000]   But to tell you the truth, I don't know.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.680]   As I said, we go from the more artificial
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.700]   to the less artificial.
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.380]   If double-strand RNA, just synthetic RNA,
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:34.700]   is the most artificial, starvation is more natural,
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:38.060]   but it's not starvation in the real context of the world,
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.500]   in a real apple.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.260]   It's a plate with or without E. coli bacteria.
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:46.860]   It's not an apple on a tree exposed to the elements
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.140]   with other worms, with bacteria,
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:50.860]   with all kinds of complications.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.580]   And it could be that we will see
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:54.660]   different durations of heritable effects.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.020]   The more natural we go,
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:58.680]   it's just much less controllable and hard to do.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:01.780]   And again, when we're talking about humans,
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:04.860]   part of the argument why people, why the disbelievers,
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.420]   it's not about faith.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:10.100]   The critics say that this wouldn't happen in humans
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:14.940]   is they say the worms' generation time is just three days.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.640]   The chances that the parent's environment will match
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.840]   the children's environment is very high
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:23.260]   because there's not a lot of time
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.500]   for the environment to change it,
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:27.160]   plus they can't go very far, they're small.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:31.940]   There are many examples of epigenetic inheritance in plants.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:35.980]   This is a big field where the very established proof
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.540]   for inheritance of acquired traits,
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:38.820]   for epigenetic inheritance.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:42.220]   Be more careful, epigenetic inheritance of acquired traits
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:45.060]   is more low than 10, but in plants it also happens.
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.620]   And then you also say these are sessile organisms,
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:50.700]   they can't run away, so the environment is more constant.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.780]   - Well, ideas, maybe just a quick example
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:53.740]   that I've heard before.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.560]   Tell me if I'm wrong, I very well may be.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:59.020]   For instance, a particular species of plant
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.340]   that grows a straight, maybe slightly bended stalk
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.860]   might be exposed to some environment
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:07.160]   where in order to capture enough sunlight
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.380]   and other nutrients might need to grow in a corkscrew form.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:12.220]   The corkscrew form can be inherited
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:13.460]   several generations from.
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:14.920]   - This is an example that I don't know,
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.560]   but perhaps it-- - Something like that.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.520]   I seem to, someone will tell, trust me,
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.580]   the one thing we know about podcasting and YouTube
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.080]   is someone will tell us in the comments.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.380]   So, and please do, we invite that.
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.860]   - Right, but there's a long history
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:28.380]   of epigenetic inheritance studies in plants
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:30.820]   with excellent studies, well-controlled,
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:32.680]   showing that it happens also there.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.120]   So this is very clear.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.520]   When it comes to humans, you could say maybe my kids
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.720]   will go off to live in a different continent
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:43.500]   and they will be on the computer every day.
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.700]   Everything will be different, so it makes less sense
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:48.760]   to prepare them for the same hardships that I experienced.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:53.380]   However, this, in my opinion, this argument comes a lot.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:58.380]   It's not the best argument because it depends on the scale
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:00.340]   of how you look at things.
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:02.180]   We experience, we meet, for example,
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:04.000]   I'm not saying that this is inherited in humans,
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.900]   but we experience the same pathogens
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:08.040]   and the same viruses all the time,
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.060]   so perhaps it is worth preparing for that.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:12.340]   Again, I'm not saying that it happens,
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:15.020]   but it depends on the scale.
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.320]   - Well, what you're describing makes perfect sense,
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.320]   and I do want to acknowledge these critics,
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.160]   whoever they may be.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.420]   I do have the advantage that I don't work
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:23.980]   in this exact field, and so I'm happy to stand
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:27.700]   toe-to-toe with those critics now and say that,
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:31.920]   at least in terms of an inheritance of reactions
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:35.640]   or adaptive or maladaptive traits to stress
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:38.220]   or to reward, you talked about nicotine before,
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:40.400]   passage of response to drugs of different kinds,
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.960]   not being specific to nicotine.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.240]   It was sort of a more general passage
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:48.660]   of some sort of information related to reactions
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.900]   to chemicals present in nicotine but other drugs.
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:58.440]   I have long been irritated and a little bit tickled
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:59.900]   by the fact that people say, oh, you know,
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:02.180]   we have this system for stress that was really designed
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:05.940]   to keep us safe from lions and saber-toothed tigers.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:08.580]   Sure, but the hallmark of the stress system
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.900]   is that it generalizes.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:12.000]   I mean, if I get a troubling text message
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.440]   or if I suddenly see a dark figure in the hallway
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.080]   when I go to the bathroom at night that I don't recognize,
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.420]   both of those have the same generic response,
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:23.140]   which is the deployment of adrenaline
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:26.240]   in both brain and body, changes in the optics of the eyes,
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.400]   quickening of the heart rate.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:30.980]   Stress is, by design, generic, and so one could imagine
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:33.840]   that a passage of some sort of stress resilience
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:36.820]   or a maladaptive passage to stress
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.320]   would be also somewhat generic,
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.960]   and that's actually advantageous overall.
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.300]   Same thing with the reward system.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:46.880]   We essentially have one or two chemical systems of reward.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.160]   I mean, there's the opioid system
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:49.560]   and there's the cannabinoid system,
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.920]   but in large part, anticipation and reward
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.080]   is governed by the dopamine circuits,
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.320]   and anticipation and reward of an ice cream cone for a kid
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:01.320]   is the same neural circuitry that's going to be repurposed
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:03.180]   when they get to reproductive age
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.740]   and they are anticipating creating children with their mate
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:06.960]   and assuming they want to do that,
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.680]   the dopaminergic system is going to be engaged.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:13.680]   So ice cream, sex, you know, stress to weather,
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.880]   stress to famine, the biology of these more modal systems,
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.940]   especially in the nervous system are,
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.180]   again, I have to be careful with the words, by design,
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:27.240]   are certainly generic, and so I don't see the need
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.320]   for immense specificity.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.040]   I mean, it's not like we're, well, COVID just happened,
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.640]   so could you imagine that there's the passage
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.620]   of a COVID-19 specific resilience?
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:38.920]   No, I think what would probably be passed along
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.600]   would be some sort of, if it does occur,
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.220]   would be some sort of resilience to viruses more generally,
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:46.000]   and that would be advantageous.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.120]   - Right, so I agree, and this opens the question
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.320]   of what is the bandwidth of inheritance?
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.920]   How specific can it be that it makes sense
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.480]   for it to be specific?
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:59.360]   And in the case of C. elegans,
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.360]   the response can be very specific
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.800]   through this inheritance of RNAs,
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.680]   which are just sequence specific,
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.160]   they control one particular gene, okay?
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:13.800]   In other cases, it could be a very general response,
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.800]   and it's very interesting to think about it
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.160]   when we talk about inheritance of memories,
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.880]   which is the most interesting thing we could imagine.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:25.720]   Can brain activity of some sort transmit,
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:26.640]   at least in these worms?
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.000]   I said, no, I said this disclaimer multiple times,
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.720]   in members we don't know, times we'll tell,
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.640]   in worms we know a lot,
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.560]   so can worms transmit brain activity,
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.240]   do they have the specificity to do it, okay?
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.320]   Before I'll say that, I'll just say that we,
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.080]   over the years, learned a lot about the mechanisms
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:47.980]   that shuttle the RNAs between generations.
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:50.580]   We know about genes that are needed just for that.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:54.040]   About worms, it would be perfectly okay,
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.480]   but just don't have the capacity to transfer the RNAs
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.940]   to the next generations.
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:00.560]   We know about genes that will make the responses
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.360]   longer or shorter.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:05.300]   We know about genes that prevent the transfer of RNA
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.680]   between different tissues.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.000]   About genes that make certain small RNAs.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.360]   So we know a lot about that.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.840]   And then the question arises, we can finally ask,
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.800]   can memory transfer between generation?
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.500]   I think that, first of all,
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.300]   we need to define memory for this,
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.520]   and the broadest definition would be,
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.820]   any change in your behavior
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.760]   because of what happened in the past,
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.680]   or in your response because what happened in the past,
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:32.840]   or because of your history.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.120]   The more interesting part, of course,
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.080]   is to talk about memories that are encoded in the brain.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.280]   And the reason is that the brain is capable
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:42.160]   of holding much more specific and elaborate memories.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:46.720]   I think that any tissues that transmit RNA
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:48.720]   to the next generation and affect the next generation,
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.640]   is interesting.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.600]   The gut, muscles, everything.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.880]   But the brain can synthesize information
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.780]   about the environment and about internal state,
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.540]   and can also think ahead.
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:02.440]   And the most provocative thing you can say
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.480]   is that you could plan how, somehow,
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.760]   the fate of your nation using your brain
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:10.640]   after taking many things into the code.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.920]   - Without talking to them.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.840]   - Right, without talking.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.040]   - Right, and instruction.
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.280]   So it's, again, we go back to this instruction manual.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.560]   It's like writing something into the instruction manual
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:20.160]   based on your own experience.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.880]   - Right, and can it happen?
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:22.840]   And what is the bandwidth?
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.440]   Can we transfer specific things?
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:28.000]   And then I have to agree with you
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.720]   that I would imagine that what can transfer,
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.320]   and I could be wrong,
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.320]   is a general something, sensitivity.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:43.080]   We can make the analogy to being inflamed or not,
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:48.080]   hypersensitive to pathogens, hypervigil, something like that.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.480]   But it can also be something very specific.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:55.080]   Now we have to understand that the brain
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.900]   uses a different language than the language of inheritance.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:02.440]   The brain, the way we normally think about the brain,
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:07.440]   is that it keeps information in synapses,
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:09.600]   in the connections between different neurons.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.080]   When you learn something,
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.660]   you make some connections stronger
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:14.840]   and other connections weaker,
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.640]   and you wire the nervous system in a different way.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.920]   The information in the brain is synaptic,
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.720]   and it is in the connections.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:26.520]   On the other hand, heritable information of any sort
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:29.660]   has to go through a bottleneck of one cell,
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:34.420]   the fertilized egg, because we all start from just one cell.
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.200]   So it cannot be in the connections,
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.900]   because this cell doesn't have any connections
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.800]   without the cell, they're alone.
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:42.640]   So heritable information has to be molecular,
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.720]   it has to be inside this one cell.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:46.920]   So the question is, can you or do you
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:50.520]   translate information, this 3D structure information
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:52.800]   of synapses and the connection between brains
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.360]   in the architecture of the brain,
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:57.200]   can you somehow translate it to heritable information
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:58.880]   to a molecular form?
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.360]   - It's an incredibly important and deep question.
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.360]   It brings to mind something that was once told to me,
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:06.400]   which as soon as I heard it was obvious,
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.720]   but was very important in formulating
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:10.780]   my understanding of biology,
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:15.440]   which is that a map is just the transformation
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.280]   of one set of points into another set of points, right?
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.320]   So a map of the world essentially is just,
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:23.560]   you take what's been drawn out
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:26.520]   in terms of the architecture and the coastlines, et cetera,
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.040]   and divisions between states,
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.960]   and you transfer that to an electronic map
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:30.800]   or a piece of paper.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:32.440]   Seems so obvious, it's sort of a duh,
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:33.920]   why are we talking about this?
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.580]   But just to make sure that people understand
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:37.320]   what you're really talking about is,
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:40.080]   let's say the memory, and I have a very distinct memory
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.120]   for my childhood phone number.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.880]   Phone number doesn't exist anymore.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:46.560]   And I won't give it out because then some other person
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.400]   might get you with repeated calls.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.040]   But in any case, I remember it,
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:51.360]   it's totally useless information,
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.120]   but it lives in my neocortex or my hippocampus
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:56.960]   or somewhere as a series of connections between neurons
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:59.080]   at the locations as you call synapses.
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:02.640]   Would my grandchildren know that phone number?
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.160]   There's no reason for them. - Absolutely no.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.000]   - No, right?
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.040]   Would my children know that,
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:08.240]   unless there was some adaptive reason
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.880]   or some other reason for them to know
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.620]   and this passage of acquired traits.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.160]   And what you're saying is, in order for that to happen,
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:20.520]   there has to be a transformation of the neural circuit,
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.560]   literally the wiring of neuron A, B, C, D
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:25.520]   that relates and carries the information of that number,
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.280]   into the kind of nucleotide sequences
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:30.920]   that are contained in DNA or patterns of methylation
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.040]   or RNA more likely.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.060]   So it's the transformation of one set of points
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:37.640]   in physical space to a translation of points
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:40.120]   in genetic space, is that right?
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:42.400]   - Right, and then we have many problems.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:45.400]   First of all, we don't know a mechanism to translate
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:47.160]   between the two different languages,
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.640]   the language of the brain and the language of inheritance.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.600]   We are not familiar with a mechanism like that.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:56.000]   Second, the next generation, if it's not a worm,
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.780]   if it's a mammal, would have a different brain.
[01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:03.780]   Even if it was genetically identical to the parrot,
[01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:05.840]   the wiring of the brain
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:09.940]   and the particular neuronal circuits will be different.
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.540]   This is true for twins.
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:13.900]   It will always be true because it depends,
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.360]   because it's partially random
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.700]   and it depends on the environment,
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:18.840]   even if you have the same genetic instructions.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:22.280]   So let's say you somehow had a mechanism,
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.600]   miracle mechanism, to take the 3D information
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:28.460]   and translate it to the language of inheritance.
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:29.800]   You would then in the next generation
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.760]   have to translate it again to the brain,
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.240]   although it is different.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:35.760]   This sounds very unlikely.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.920]   I'm playing a trick on you now, okay?
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:44.580]   - I believe it, I'm easy to trick, so that's good.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:46.800]   - But if this is how it happened,
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:48.340]   or if this was required,
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.560]   it could never happen in my opinion.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.020]   Which means, and I still think,
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:53.180]   that there are certain memories
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:56.480]   that cannot transfer transgenerationalities complex,
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.600]   and things that you learn about the environment
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:54:59.600]   that are arbitrary.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:05.180]   None of our listeners' kids will remember this conversation.
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:06.780]   No way, this is impossible.
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:08.620]   - Unless they're listening with them.
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:09.820]   There are some families or parents
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:11.480]   that tell me they're listening.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:14.520]   - But it cannot transmit because it's random,
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:16.960]   and these are connections that are arbitrary.
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:21.200]   So this seems to be a limitation of what can transfer.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.680]   On the other hand, so perhaps more general things
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.220]   could pass, these type of things, I doubt they could pass.
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:32.480]   However, you can nevertheless imagine
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:34.940]   that some things that are very specific,
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:37.160]   some memories that are very, very specific,
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:39.440]   could nevertheless transmit from the brain
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.320]   after learning to the next generation.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.960]   I'll give you an example.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.900]   You can teach worms, even though they have just 302 neurons,
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:48.020]   you can teach them simple things about the world.
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:50.480]   For example, you can take an odor that the worms like.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:53.880]   The worms have thousands of odorant receptors,
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.700]   and they can recognize many, many, many molecules.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:00.300]   They can smell them so they can find food or avoid enemies.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:03.680]   You can take an odor that the worms like,
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:06.920]   and pair it to something bad, like starvation.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:09.480]   And then the worms will learn to dislike this odor.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.840]   We don't know that this learning involves necessarily
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.360]   changing in the strength of synapses.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:19.920]   It's a possibility, but it doesn't have to be the case.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.400]   It could be that just the receptor for this particular odor
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.920]   is being removed, and this is how they live.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:29.680]   Now they won't have the receptor, they won't smell,
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:30.880]   they won't like the odor.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:31.980]   This is a possibility.
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:36.080]   This type of thing, you can perhaps,
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.600]   not that anyone has showed it convincingly,
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:40.000]   transmit to the next generation,
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.600]   because all it would take is an RNA
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.680]   that will control this particular receptor, okay?
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:48.320]   So this is a possibility.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:51.320]   People have shown things like that, not in C. elegans,
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:53.820]   but people have shown things like this in mammals.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:56.840]   They said that you learn certain thing,
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:59.680]   and then just in the next generation,
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:02.840]   that a particular receptor would be methylated
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:05.620]   or would change, and this would transmit the response.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:10.100]   And on the one hand, it could be true.
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.680]   On the other hand, you need to understand,
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.580]   they'll need to prove,
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:16.460]   and this wasn't done convincingly enough yet,
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:18.540]   how exactly does the information transfer
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:20.380]   from the brain to the germ cells,
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:21.540]   and then in the next generation,
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:23.260]   from the germ cells back to the brain
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:26.620]   to where the receptor need to operate.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:27.900]   And this is a challenge.
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:30.380]   This is the current state of the field
[01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:32.700]   that this is something that needs to be proven.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.380]   What we didn't see, elegans,
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:38.860]   is we showed that the brain can communicate
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.340]   with the next generations using small RNAs,
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:44.720]   and that this can change behavior.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:48.160]   And it doesn't require any translating between any language.
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.500]   It is very simple.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.300]   What we've shown is that if you take a worm
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:54.680]   and you change the production of small RNAs
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:58.480]   just in its brain, in the next generations,
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:57:59.940]   their behavior will be different,
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.240]   even though you don't mess with their brains.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.880]   This is a paper that we published in 2019 in Cell.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:09.960]   We showed that you just manipulate the production
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:13.280]   of endogenous natural RNAs in the worm's brain
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:16.200]   that are always made, but you change their amount,
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.560]   and this changes the capacity of the worms
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.680]   in the next generation to find food,
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:23.640]   to find, not only in one generation,
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.920]   but three generations down the road.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.600]   And the way that it works is that
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.120]   perturbing the production of these small RNAs in the brain
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:37.000]   affects in the end the expression of a gene in the germline.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.840]   One gene is called SAGE2, don't know how it works,
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.840]   but we can do all kinds of controls
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:44.380]   where we manipulate the activity of the gene
[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:46.960]   and see that this also affects behavior.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:50.700]   And this gene works in the germ cells.
[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:53.120]   The information needs to go from the brain to the germ cells.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.960]   It doesn't need to go back from the germ cells
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.040]   to the brain to affect behavior.
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:59.200]   And this depends, we know that this is
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:01.440]   a true epigenetic effect because it goes on
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.800]   for multiple generations,
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:05.440]   and also because it requires the machinery
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:08.440]   that transfers RNAs between generations.
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.720]   If you don't have the protein that physically carries
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:12.620]   the RNA between generations, it doesn't happen.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:14.460]   - So it has to be RNA.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:15.560]   - It has to be RNA.
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:18.720]   And we can actually, we can also find the RNAs
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:20.400]   in the next generation that change.
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.960]   We sequence the actual RNAs that change
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:24.360]   in the next generation.
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.960]   - You mentioned that you don't know what SAGE,
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:29.800]   this gene SAGE does, but is it reasonable to assume
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:32.240]   that it does something in the context of the nervous system
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.480]   or that's unclear as well?
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.120]   - It is possible, it is possible,
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:40.120]   but we have reasons to believe or experiments to show,
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.920]   although there could be alternative explanations,
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:45.000]   that it functions for the germ line.
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.100]   Now you may ask, how can you affect behavior
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.140]   just by changing the germ cells, right?
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:51.960]   - Well, it would have to change the germ cells
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:55.400]   in very specific ways because as people probably recall,
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:58.280]   the germ line, the germ cells are where
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:00.680]   the inheritable information is contained,
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.560]   but you can imagine it, for instance,
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:07.560]   adjusting the gain or sensitivity rather
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:12.560]   on some sort of sensory foraging system, right?
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:16.000]   - Right, and the interesting thing is
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.960]   it again can be quite unspecific.
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:22.560]   So it sounds weird that you change germ cells
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.440]   and it changes behavior, sperm and egg,
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440]   but if you think about it, it's trivial.
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:30.180]   If you castrate a dog, it behaves differently, right?
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:31.920]   - Sadly, yeah, I did that to my dog
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:34.080]   and I ended up putting him on testosterone therapy later
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:37.720]   and it brought him back, just as an aside.
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.140]   - Yes, this is because the germ cells affect the soma,
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.320]   including the brain, in many ways
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.880]   by secreting certain chemicals.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:49.540]   And also because the other cells develop
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:52.120]   from the germ cells, so some information
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.480]   could be transmitted over development
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.920]   or the course of development could be altered
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.100]   because of changes that occur in the germ cells.
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:03.360]   For example, in mammals, one of the explanations
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.880]   for how inheritable information transmits
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:10.120]   is that it just affects something very own in development.
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.700]   I told you that the secret to worm's inheritance
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:15.500]   is that they have the capacity to amplify
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:16.980]   these small RNAs all the time.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:20.720]   This is what keeps it going, prevents the dilution.
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.280]   In mammals, we don't know of such an amplification mechanism
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:26.840]   so you ask, how can a little bit of RNA or something
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:29.920]   without amplifying affect the entire organism?
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:32.900]   And it could be that you just perturb something
[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:36.160]   in the very beginning, when you just have a few cells
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.720]   or even in the placenta that develops in pregnancy
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:42.240]   and this later throws everything off
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.440]   and because of that, you have many problems
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:46.320]   in metabolism and so on.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.200]   And this is called, it's an idea
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.640]   of the developmental origin of health and disease.
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.520]   Many of the functions occur early on in development.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:56.360]   - So you raised a number
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.680]   of incredibly fascinating aspects to this.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:01.000]   I do have a question about one particular aspect
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.200]   and feel free to pass on this for a future episode
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.080]   if it's going to take us too far off track.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.860]   But something you said, it really captured my attention,
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:11.020]   although I was listening to all of it,
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:12.680]   which is that the germ cells,
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:15.560]   so in the case of males, it's going to be sperm
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:18.240]   and in the case of females, it can be eggs.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.740]   Something perhaps not coincidental about those cells
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:25.240]   and the environment that they live in is that yes,
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:26.920]   they contain the genetic information
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:28.200]   that passed to offspring, right?
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.480]   Of course you explained how that works,
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:35.480]   but also those cells live in a region
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:39.000]   that is rich with hormones that can be secreted
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.300]   and in fact are secreted
[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:42.780]   and through so-called endocrine signaling,
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:44.980]   communicate with other cells,
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:47.120]   not just at the level of receptors on their surface,
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.040]   but also can enter the genomes of those cells
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.480]   and modify those cells.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:52.960]   In other words, it seems to me that the microenvironment
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.960]   of the germ cells, the testes and the ovaries
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:58.260]   are rich with information,
[02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:00.220]   not just for the passage to next generations,
[02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:02.240]   but also for all the, as you said,
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.880]   all the somatic cells of the body,
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:05.640]   they're telling the somatic cells of the body
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.480]   what to do and what to become.
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.340]   And the best example I can think about this
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:09.560]   would be puberty, right?
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:13.880]   I mean, I would argue that one of the greatest rates
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:16.720]   of aging and transitions we go through in life
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:17.560]   is from puberty.
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:19.440]   I mean, a child becomes a very different person
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.280]   after puberty.
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:21.400]   They look at the world differently.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.160]   They think about it differently.
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:24.840]   It's not just about the growth of the hair and the jaw
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:27.100]   and the atoms, apple and breasts and so on.
[02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:30.640]   It's a transformation of the somatic cells
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:32.400]   from the same microenvironment
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.400]   that the DNA containing cells reside.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.520]   - Right, so once you think about it like this,
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:41.520]   it becomes obvious that just by affecting the germ cells,
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:43.360]   you can affect the rest of the body.
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:44.920]   And in C. elegans, there are experiments
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:45.980]   that show it very clearly.
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:49.000]   So for example, if you just take worms
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.980]   and prevent sperm production,
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.100]   it changes the capacity to smell.
[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:57.180]   These are experiments done by others,
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:04:00.480]   which is obviously a brain function.
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:01.640]   - And in a castrated dog,
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.600]   you're not just eliminating the possibility
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:07.200]   of transfer of DNA information to subsequent generations.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:09.560]   You're also limiting communication of, yeah.
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:11.520]   Oh, without question, my bulldog, Costello,
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.640]   changed after castration and was a wonderful dog,
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:16.420]   but at some point developed some health issues.
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:18.800]   The introduction of a small amount of testosterone
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.040]   every other day changed him fundamentally,
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:23.940]   in that case for the better,
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:25.580]   back to a version of himself
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:26.800]   that I had only observed earlier,
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:28.660]   but also a different version of the same dog.
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:30.220]   And no, he wasn't humping everything,
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:32.120]   maybe the occasional knee,
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.360]   particular people whose names I won't mention.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:37.680]   But it was absolutely clear that the hormone
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.660]   was not just taking a system and amplifying it.
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.840]   It was actually modifying the system.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.920]   So anyway, I just wanted to highlight that.
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:47.340]   And then now, thank you for indulging me.
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:49.120]   Let's, if you will,
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:52.400]   let's continue down this path that we were going on,
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:53.220]   because I want to make sure
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:54.960]   that we absolutely get to this issue
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:56.760]   of transmission of information
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:59.040]   about sex choice of offspring.
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.560]   - So the worms are hermaphrodites,
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:04.520]   which means that they make both sperm and eggs.
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:07.000]   But there are also males, which are much more rare,
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.600]   and they can choose to mate with the males or not.
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:14.720]   And when they mate with the male, it's a huge decision,
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:17.840]   because it's very costly, energetically,
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:22.060]   and they also risk predation and all kinds of troubles.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:24.400]   The males hurt them and reduce their lifespan
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:25.540]   when they mate with them.
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:27.700]   - People are gonna draw all sorts of analogies here,
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:29.560]   but it's inevitable, but hey, here we go.
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:33.680]   - Yes, and most importantly for evolution,
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:36.520]   when you mate with another animal,
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:39.200]   you dilute your genome in half,
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:41.280]   'cause the worms can just self-fertilize
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.760]   and transmit the exact same genome to the next generation,
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:45.800]   but when they mate, they dilute it in half.
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:48.560]   So this is a big price to pay.
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:51.560]   On the other hand, when you mate, you diversify your genome.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:54.280]   So maybe some combination of gene will be good.
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.160]   - And we know that in humans, I mean,
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:57.920]   it's kind of interesting that the brain circuits
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:02.000]   that are associated with aversion and with approach
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.040]   are fairly hardwired for a number of things,
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:07.440]   like puddle of vomit, almost everybody kind of cringes,
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.400]   a plate of cookies, if you like cookies, you move towards it.
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:13.160]   But there's one particular word in the English
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:14.280]   and presenting the Israeli language
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:17.920]   that ought to evoke disgust, and that's incest,
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:20.280]   because incest is actually not just disgusting
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:22.920]   as a practice, but it's dangerous genetically, right,
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:25.600]   because inbreeding creates a deleterious mutation.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.200]   - Right, so there are studies of how people
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.120]   in Israeli kibbutz, for example,
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:31.560]   where they all grow together, the children live together,
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:34.600]   it used to be like that, don't date each other,
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:36.080]   'cause this is their classic thing.
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:37.560]   I talked to some of them, the kibbutz told me
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:39.760]   that's not true, but yes, there are studies like this
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:41.280]   that say, but it makes sense.
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.080]   - And in some countries, Scandinavian countries,
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.920]   or in Lapland and Iceland where populations are small,
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.320]   they keep exquisite records of lineage
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:50.040]   in order to avoid inbreeding.
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.040]   - Right, right, so you're absolutely right.
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.880]   But the worms, it's the safe choice for them
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:58.520]   is to self mate, and if they mate with a male,
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:01.040]   they take a risk, but they diversify, okay?
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:07.120]   What we found is that if you take the hermaphrodites,
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:10.240]   we can call it the female for just one second,
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:12.680]   and you stress it with high temperatures,
[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:18.220]   then the next generations of worms, for three generations,
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:21.280]   mate much more with males, and they do it
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:23.760]   because the female starts secreting a pheromone
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.520]   that attracts the males.
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:28.600]   - Ah, that's a very cryptic mechanism.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:31.360]   It's not that she somehow changes and then goes seeking males
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.760]   it's that it draws males in.
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:34.440]   - It draws males, and we know how it works.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.480]   We think we know how it works.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:38.720]   What happens is that the stress, the high temperatures,
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:42.360]   compromise the production of sperm in the hermaphrodites.
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:44.720]   So the hermaphrodite don't, they make sperm enough
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:47.280]   to make generations, but the sperm,
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:50.160]   because of defective small RNA inherited,
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:52.400]   'cause RNAs are not inherited, okay?
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:56.240]   The sperm is not made optimally, so they make less sperm.
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:58.920]   And when they don't make a lot of sperm,
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:01.580]   they feel that they don't self-fertilize correctly,
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:04.340]   so they call the males by secreting the pheromones
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:06.840]   so that it would provide its own sperm
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.560]   and they can continue to make babies, okay?
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:11.080]   And we know this also from experiments,
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:13.480]   you just take hermaphrodites and you kill its sperm,
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.640]   starts secreting the pheromone, and the males come.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:18.600]   - It's a need-based system. - Exactly, exactly.
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:19.440]   - Incredible.
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.480]   And I hope people can appreciate as they're hearing this
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:24.480]   that none of this, we assume,
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:26.520]   I don't know how to speak worm,
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:29.460]   none of this, we assume, is a conscious decision
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:32.200]   in these animals, much like human mating behavior,
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:34.140]   which to us always seems so conscious,
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:35.920]   but is being governed by both conscious
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.980]   and subconscious decision-making.
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:40.960]   None of this is an active decision
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:44.240]   to secrete the hormone to draw in more males.
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:46.920]   It's simply a biasing of probabilities, right?
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:49.640]   The hormone is now secreted in greater quantities
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:52.800]   or greater frequency, the males therefore approach more,
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.160]   so it's just increasing probability of interactions.
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.000]   Is that right?
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.760]   - What happens, naturally, normally,
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.080]   if you don't stress the ancestors,
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.360]   is that the worm starts secreting the pheromone
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:03.880]   only when they are old.
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:05.720]   It's also, you know, people will-
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:08.840]   - When they're running out of their own fertility.
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:10.880]   - Exactly, because they only make the sperm
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:14.560]   at a particular time, and then they run out of stem,
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.800]   they can self-fertilize, so they have to call the males
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:18.520]   if they want to continue to mate.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:21.720]   - Well, this is sort of the plastic surgery approach.
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.120]   Okay, I'll take the heat for that one.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.240]   But, you know, but it's true, I think as certain people age
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:27.320]   to a certain point and they feel
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:30.400]   that their fertility is waning, if they want offspring,
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:32.460]   they need to take any number of different approaches.
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:34.360]   They could get a, here we're talking about a female,
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:37.200]   but we could also do the reverse, right?
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:38.520]   Sperm donor, right?
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:40.200]   But if they want to attract a lifelong mate
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:44.120]   or co-parent with somebody, oftentimes they will do things
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:46.120]   to adjust their attractiveness
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:47.080]   in any number of different ways,
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:49.960]   psychological attractiveness or physical attractiveness.
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.000]   I'm not afraid to bring this up
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.260]   because I think that the parallels are very important
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:56.240]   because I do think that every species
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:58.180]   and individuals within a species, of course,
[02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.240]   decides whether or not they want to reproduce or not,
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.400]   but has an inherent understanding, conscious or subconscious,
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:06.740]   about where they reside in the arc of their lifespan.
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:09.480]   I do believe that, not just based on experience.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:12.760]   Some people are very attuned to the passage of time
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:15.000]   being very fast, others very slow.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.040]   I think that knowing how long your parents
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.340]   and their parents lived makes a big difference.
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:21.660]   I have friends whose fathers in particular
[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:24.680]   died fairly young, and all these guys basically got married
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:26.200]   and had kids really young.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:28.540]   - Right, so here, luckily for me,
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:31.020]   I don't have to get into psychology of the worms.
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:33.660]   The explanation is just like an instinct.
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:34.820]   When they run out of sperm,
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:37.240]   they start secreting the pheromones and attract the males.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:41.200]   There are studies also in humans about older fathers,
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.120]   that children of older fathers have more,
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:47.700]   has a higher chance of becoming autistic.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:49.760]   - 40 and up, basically.
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.540]   - However, in this case, it's not clear
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.880]   that this is not, that this is something epigenetics
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:56.040]   could be just because of DNA damage,
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:58.520]   because it accumulates.
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:10:59.920]   - And actually nowadays there,
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:01.560]   we have an episode on fertility coming up,
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:02.780]   both male and female fertility.
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:06.960]   And there are actually DNA fragmentation kits for,
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:09.280]   at home DNA fragmentation kits are sperm analysis.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:11.400]   You send the sperm back in, you don't get the DNA.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.680]   People pipetting semen at home would be an odd picture.
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.760]   Let's not go there.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.340]   But there are clinics that do this for a nominal charge.
[02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:24.160]   But it's, I did want to ask about autism
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:25.680]   and human disease in particular.
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:27.340]   Another thing that you hear sometimes,
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.560]   and here I want to acknowledge autism is on a spectrum.
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:31.520]   Some people get upset if you call it a disorder.
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.060]   There are some adaptive autistic traits and et cetera.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:37.700]   But one thing that often comes up is this idea
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:42.280]   that two people who are more of the kind of engineering,
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:44.900]   hard science, if you will, of phenotype,
[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:46.280]   mate and have children,
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:50.480]   higher probability of the offspring being on the spectrum.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:51.660]   Some people would argue, ah,
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:53.120]   but that's already selecting for people
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:55.060]   that might've already been partially on the spectrum.
[02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:56.680]   So maybe it's a gene copy issue.
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:59.380]   I'm not asking you to comment on autism in particular,
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:01.560]   but when you hear things like that,
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:03.920]   that the children of older fathers,
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.000]   born from older fathers,
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.500]   tend the higher probability of autism,
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:11.540]   what does that, at the level of intuition,
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:14.020]   does that strike you as an epigenetic phenomenon,
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:16.800]   as a nurture mishmash,
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:20.080]   or the possibility that it's RNA passage or anything?
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.400]   Does anything sort of trigger the whiskers,
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:24.880]   your spidey sense?
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.800]   - So in that case,
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:28.480]   I would go with the most parsimonious explanation,
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:33.360]   which is just less fidelity of DNA,
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:36.680]   less DNA maintenance and some damage that passes on.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:39.420]   It doesn't have to be an epigenetic thing.
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:42.240]   - But the sperm are generated at once every 60 days.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.080]   So the damage must be at the level of the germ cells
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:46.960]   not having the proper machinery?
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:47.800]   - Right.
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:48.640]   - Mitochondria or something like that?
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:50.780]   - Or the DNA repair machinery.
[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:53.560]   The DNA repair machinery could be defective
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:57.020]   or could work less well in older people,
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:00.100]   leading to the constant production of germ cells
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:00.940]   with more mutation.
[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:01.900]   This is a possibility.
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:04.680]   - Do we know exactly what the DNA repair machinery is?
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.520]   - Yes.
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.680]   There are many types of DNA repair.
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:11.880]   There's one that use other copies of the DNA
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:15.240]   to correct.
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:17.880]   There are ones that just recognize all kinds of lesions
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:20.880]   on the DNA and remove it.
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:23.720]   It's a very elaborate and complicated system.
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:25.600]   - And is it a system that is now tractable
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:28.520]   that can be modified through pharmacology
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.880]   or through anything like that?
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:33.480]   - So I don't know about drugs that improve it.
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:35.800]   Maybe they exist and I'm not aware,
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:37.680]   but it's very well understood
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:40.440]   and many people have studied these directions.
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.380]   - Yeah, one thing that came across
[02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:45.560]   in the exploration of the fertility work
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:49.980]   is that what I'm about to describe is not legal in the US.
[02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:52.080]   It is illegal, but is legal in the UK
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:55.560]   and in other countries is this notion of three parent IVF,
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:58.060]   where it does seem that some of the eggs
[02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:01.000]   that persist in older females don't,
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.860]   even if fertilized, don't produce healthy embryos,
[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:07.540]   they have chromosomal abnormalities or replications
[02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:10.940]   and deletions that are problematic for the development
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:15.940]   of the embryo, such as trisomy 21, AKA Down syndrome,
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:18.460]   in part or in large part because of deficits
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:19.780]   in the mitochondrial genome.
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:21.820]   So what they now do is they take the,
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.940]   because the mitochondrial genome resides mainly
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:27.500]   in the cytoplasm, they'll take an egg from the mother,
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:28.620]   the sperm from the father,
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:32.020]   but they'll take the nucleus from the mother
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:36.500]   and put that into a cytoplasm of a younger woman
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:38.260]   whose mitochondrial DNA is healthy,
[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:41.960]   then use the sperm to fertilize that egg,
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:43.620]   and that's why it's called three parent IVF,
[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:45.220]   then implant that into the mother.
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:46.980]   And this has been done several times
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:49.220]   for in cases of mitochondrial damage
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:52.300]   or mutations in the mother.
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:54.180]   It works, the question is whether or not
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:56.160]   those offspring will grow up to be healthy.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:59.060]   So this, of course, is not just a pure divergence.
[02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:00.940]   It raises a bigger question that I have for you,
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:05.480]   which is in terms of the work in either C. elegans
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:06.860]   or in other model organisms,
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:09.040]   but in particular in C. elegans,
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:10.820]   where do you see this going next?
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:12.580]   And if you would indulge us,
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:13.920]   I would love for you to tell us a little bit
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:16.680]   about the admittedly unpublished work that you're doing
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:20.020]   on temperature exposure and environments.
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:22.020]   I mean, how malleable is this system?
[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:25.820]   Because to me, it just seems incredibly malleable,
[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:28.500]   and yet a lot of it's still cloaked off to us.
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:29.780]   There's still a ton to learn.
[02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:34.300]   - So assuming that we will discover similar things
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:36.900]   in humans, which we don't know that this is the case,
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:38.600]   but let's say we find it.
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:39.960]   I think there are many things you can do
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.120]   before you change it.
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:47.120]   For example, you could also change aberrant inheritance
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:52.200]   by having the parent exercise, for example.
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.140]   And some things like this have been done.
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:57.080]   For example, there are experiments in rodents
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:01.600]   where they show that overfeeding the rodents
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:03.340]   creates problems for the next generations,
[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:05.300]   for the children.
[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:09.700]   However, if you let the rodent exercise,
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:11.740]   then it corrects the aberrant inheritance.
[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:13.180]   So this is one possibility.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:16.940]   And you can also manipulate it at the source.
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:18.900]   You can change if it's RNAs.
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:20.380]   Let's say you could, in the future,
[02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:22.300]   perhaps if we understand how it works,
[02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:24.960]   actually change the composition of the heritable RNAs.
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.700]   - By eating RNAs just like the worms?
[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:27.700]   A RNA sandwich?
[02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:29.820]   - No, so the RNA sandwich will be difficult
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:32.220]   because it's not, I don't know,
[02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:35.500]   but if you do IVF, if you're doing vitro fertilization,
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:38.740]   you could perhaps change the composition of the RNAs
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:40.860]   in the stuff that you introduce.
[02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:44.340]   But way before that, what you could do,
[02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:46.820]   perhaps even in the not so far future,
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:49.860]   is use this for diagnostics.
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:53.260]   DNA-based diagnostics for every couple
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.500]   that wants to have a kid.
[02:16:54.500 --> 02:16:58.340]   In Israel, this is done for most couples.
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:01.980]   You can look at the DNA and look for genetic disease.
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:04.580]   But no one is looking at the RNA at the moment.
[02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:06.220]   If we understand how it works better,
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:09.380]   we'll have another level, a whole new world to look at.
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:11.200]   And perhaps there will be some RNAs
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.340]   that correlate with disease that will say,
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:18.580]   okay, the beauty is that this, unlike DNA, it's plastic.
[02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:19.980]   So with DNA, this is your DNA,
[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:22.340]   perhaps we can choose another embryo.
[02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:24.940]   But here you could say, perhaps,
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:26.640]   or again, in the future, this is science fiction,
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:29.100]   doesn't happen now, but if we understand this and it's true,
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:32.460]   we can say, maybe you should run on the treadmill
[02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:34.760]   a little bit, this will change the profile of your RNAs,
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:37.360]   and then we will use it for IVF.
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.000]   This seems more, because just it correlates
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.380]   with healthy profiles of RNAs.
[02:17:42.380 --> 02:17:44.220]   This is a level that no one looks at now
[02:17:44.220 --> 02:17:46.700]   and holds great potential.
[02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:48.740]   Again, with a disclaimer that we don't know
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:50.380]   how it works in humans at all.
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:51.220]   - Yeah.
[02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:52.060]   - Yes.
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:54.540]   But of course, this is why it's so interesting.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:57.980]   - Yeah, it's super interesting, incredibly promising.
[02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:59.940]   So along the lines of things that one can do
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:04.780]   in the short term, and your experiments on C. elegans,
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.460]   I'd love for you to share with us what you're observing
[02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:10.620]   about cold exposure and how that impacts
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:12.960]   subsequent generations of C. elegans.
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:16.060]   And if you would indulge us with the story
[02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:19.340]   of this discovery, like some of the earlier stories
[02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:22.220]   you told us, it is a surprising and fascinating one.
[02:18:22.220 --> 02:18:23.460]   - I'll gladly tell you about it.
[02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:25.820]   This is not a story about transgenerational inherent.
[02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:28.220]   It's a story about memory within one generation.
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:29.060]   - Ah, excuse me, okay.
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:30.740]   - Within one generation, okay?
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:33.300]   And as you said, the story of how it happens
[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:36.500]   is totally by accident, it's a funny story.
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:39.660]   And I'm bringing this up because I know Donna Landshaft
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:43.220]   who is a huge fan of your postdocs will really be happy.
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:45.020]   - This is her work.
[02:18:45.020 --> 02:18:47.180]   - This is her work and this is unpublished work.
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:50.180]   We didn't even finish it, so we're working on it.
[02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:52.420]   - Okay, well, when it's published, we will feature the paper
[02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:53.980]   'cause I love this story.
[02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:55.420]   - Oh, thanks a lot, thanks a lot.
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:58.900]   Great, so what happened is that when you,
[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:00.660]   we talked about transgenerational memories
[02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:02.700]   and I said that in worms,
[02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:04.780]   there are very long transgenerational memories.
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:08.300]   If a generation time for C. elegans is three days,
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:11.380]   some memories last for many generations,
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:13.980]   so way beyond the lifespan of the worm.
[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:16.980]   The lifespan of the worm is three weeks, okay?
[02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:18.700]   You have a new generation every three days,
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:20.540]   but every worm lives for three weeks.
[02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:22.980]   But there's a lot of research that shows
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:26.220]   that unlike heritable memory, which can be very long,
[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:29.380]   the memories that the worms acquire during the lifetime
[02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:30.940]   is very short-lived.
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:34.000]   So if you teach something, after two hours, it forgets.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.060]   So for example, you can teach the worm,
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:40.620]   you can take an order that it likes
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:42.380]   and pair it with starvation
[02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:44.500]   and then it would dislike the order.
[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:47.220]   And then there's a simple test, you just put it in a plate,
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:49.200]   you put the order in one side
[02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:50.500]   and the control order in the other side
[02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:52.300]   and you see whether it prefers this order or not
[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:54.280]   and it stops preferring it, okay?
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:57.620]   There is 30 years or more of research,
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:19:59.380]   40 years of research on this,
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:02.540]   showing that the worms forget after two hours.
[02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:04.380]   The reason I went to study C. elegans
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:06.220]   is that I wanted to understand memory
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:07.980]   because such a simple nervous system,
[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:09.020]   you say maybe I have the potential
[02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.580]   to actually understand how it works.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.900]   But this is slightly disappointing
[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:13.060]   because they forget after two hours.
[02:20:13.060 --> 02:20:14.460]   So what is it exactly, okay?
[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:18.340]   My idea was, and I tried to convince students
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:21.460]   to do it for 10 years, is to take the worms,
[02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:24.220]   teach them this association to dislike the order
[02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:25.340]   that they innately like,
[02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:29.620]   and then just put the worms in minus 80 and freeze them,
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:31.140]   freeze them completely,
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:33.180]   thaw them and see whether they still remember
[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:34.220]   after their thought.
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:35.980]   - The Han Solo experiment.
[02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:37.180]   - And I didn't want to do it
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:39.900]   because of cryopreservation or something like this.
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:42.620]   I wanted to do it because, as you know better than me,
[02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:44.420]   many theories about memory
[02:20:44.420 --> 02:20:46.180]   say that you need electrical activity
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:47.380]   to maintain the memory,
[02:20:47.380 --> 02:20:48.900]   need to reverberate it in the brain.
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:52.580]   During dreams or replay of the thing or whatever.
[02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:54.980]   - And if the memories will nevertheless be kept,
[02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:58.940]   even though the worms were frozen in minus 80,
[02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:03.660]   it would mean that it was kept in the absence of electricity
[02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:06.340]   because there was no electricity in minus 80 degrees.
[02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:07.620]   This was the idea.
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:09.900]   I asked many students, no one wanted to do it
[02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:12.820]   because it's not so easy and also a little crazy.
[02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:15.260]   - Well, and when the PI, the principal investigator
[02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:16.540]   or lab has a pet experiment,
[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:17.380]   no one wants to do that experiment.
[02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:19.620]   - That is true, that is the university tool.
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:23.180]   So, and then I agreed to do it, Dana Landshaft.
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:25.820]   I was very happy only later to find out
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:27.260]   that she ignored me completely
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:29.420]   and did a different experiment.
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:32.660]   The experiment that Dana did instead
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:35.620]   is to just take the worms, teach them the association
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.300]   and place them on ice.
[02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.980]   She wanted to see how the kinetics of memory
[02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:43.140]   and forgetting change in low temperature
[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:48.140]   because maybe whatever memory is,
[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:51.740]   the breakdown of the memory is affected by the temperature.
[02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:54.500]   A very simple idea.
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:55.660]   - Different experiment.
[02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:58.540]   - A different experiment, but a cool experiment.
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:21:59.580]   - Very cool.
[02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:03.060]   - And what she found is that when you place the worms on ice
[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:05.220]   after you teach them, they just don't forget.
[02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:08.940]   If they're even 10 times longer than control worms.
[02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:10.660]   At that point, after 24 hours,
[02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:12.740]   if no one wants to forget after two hours,
[02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:14.500]   after 24 hours, the worms will become sick.
[02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:16.940]   So normally we do shorter experiments, okay?
[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:19.380]   But for two hours, the worms don't forget.
[02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:21.380]   This is cool, but it was only the beginning
[02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:26.980]   because the boring explanation is just what I just said,
[02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:29.020]   that everything slows down in low temperatures.
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:31.300]   So the breakdown of memory, again, we don't know what it is,
[02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:35.060]   but whatever it is, happens slower in low temperatures.
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:36.060]   But this is not the case.
[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:38.300]   It's not merely the physical, it's the response,
[02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:40.900]   it's the changing of the internal state of the worms
[02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:42.380]   which affects the memory kinetics.
[02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:43.660]   How do we know this?
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:46.020]   There's a beautiful work over the last one years
[02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:49.780]   on cold tolerance in C. elegans nematodes.
[02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:52.820]   If you take the worms and you place them on ice,
[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:55.820]   like she did, but longer, for 48 hours, they all die.
[02:22:55.820 --> 02:22:58.940]   However, if you take the worms,
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:03.100]   acclimate them to lower temperatures for a few hours,
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:04.420]   five hours is the minimum,
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:07.020]   and then place them on ice, they all survive.
[02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:09.260]   They become cold tolerant and people who study this show
[02:23:09.260 --> 02:23:12.100]   that this involves changes in lipid metabolism
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:12.940]   and many things.
[02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:16.620]   So Dana took the worms, acclimated them
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:20.740]   to slightly lower temperatures, made them cold resistant,
[02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:22.740]   and then taught them their association
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:26.900]   and placed them on ice, and now they forgot immediately,
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:29.300]   which means that when they change their internal state
[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.100]   to become cold tolerant,
[02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:32.980]   they no longer extend memories on ice,
[02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:34.300]   which means it's not only the temperature
[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:36.100]   because the temperature was in any way low.
[02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:37.580]   Now they know the memory.
[02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:39.940]   We took this as a starting point to understand
[02:23:39.940 --> 02:23:43.020]   which genes change when the worms are becoming
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:44.700]   cold tolerant on and off ice.
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:47.540]   And we found genes that when you mutate them,
[02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:50.220]   the worms just remember longer always,
[02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:51.420]   even when they're off ice,
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:53.100]   because these are the genes that normally change
[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:55.580]   when they are surprised on the ice.
[02:23:55.580 --> 02:23:59.860]   And these genes are expressed just in one pair of neurons,
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:02.180]   just two out of the 302.
[02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:04.140]   - Notice he said 302, not 300.
[02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:08.060]   - And we can manipulate the activities of these genes
[02:24:08.060 --> 02:24:10.740]   in these neurons to extend memory.
[02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:16.380]   And then the punchline of everything that happened
[02:24:16.380 --> 02:24:19.380]   is that we found out that this neuron,
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:22.500]   where these genes function, this one pair of neuron,
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:24.380]   is the only neuron in C. elegans
[02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:26.700]   which is sensitive to lithium.
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:31.180]   Lithium is a drug that is being given
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:35.580]   to bipolar disorder patients for decades,
[02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:37.260]   although it's not entirely clear how it works.
[02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:39.060]   It's very, very interesting.
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:39.900]   It's also interesting.
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:42.100]   There's an episode, of course, in your podcast about this.
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:43.860]   You know more about this than me a lot,
[02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:45.860]   but it's also interesting because it's just an atom
[02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:47.020]   created in the big bang,
[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:50.340]   yet it works on our brains in such a fundamental way.
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:52.700]   And we wanted to see whether it works also on the worm
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:54.500]   because this neuron was tied
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:57.100]   to this memory extension phenotype that we found.
[02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:59.780]   So Dana grew the worms on lithium,
[02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:01.180]   removed them from lithium,
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:04.660]   got them the association and found out
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:09.460]   that they remember a lot longer than control worms.
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:12.700]   Not only that, if you first make the worms cold tolerant,
[02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:15.460]   and then lithium doesn't work on them.
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:19.980]   So lithium switches this forgetfulness mechanism on and off.
[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:20.820]   - Amazing.
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:23.620]   - And it's all connected to cold tolerance.
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:28.300]   - Amazing and amazing for a number of reasons.
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:30.900]   And so at risk of being long-winded in my response,
[02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:33.120]   I just wanted to highlight something
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:35.360]   that I think will be of relevance to most people,
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:37.480]   which is when at some point
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.400]   we did a few episodes on memory
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:42.020]   and I highlighted a review
[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:43.560]   that was written by the great James McGaugh,
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:45.440]   one of the great mammalian memory researchers
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:47.580]   who's worked a lot on humans and mice.
[02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:50.920]   And I was shocked, pun intended,
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:53.980]   and amused to learn that in medieval times,
[02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:56.760]   if people wanted children to remember lessons,
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:58.680]   they could be religious lessons or school doctrine
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:00.320]   or whatever it was, mathematics,
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:03.040]   they would take children, teach them,
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:05.000]   and then throw them into cold water
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.000]   to introduce a memory instilling event.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.720]   And we now know that the memory instilling event
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:13.360]   is the release of adrenaline in the body,
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:14.400]   which makes perfect sense
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.180]   if you think about traumatic events,
[02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:18.340]   but it also, this whole general mechanism
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:20.940]   also applies to the learning of other types of information.
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:24.500]   And so if I understand correctly about the role of lithium
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:25.800]   and the role of cold in the experiments
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:27.320]   that you just described,
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:30.080]   there's some general state switch,
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:31.960]   some internal state switch that says,
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:35.620]   what happened in the minutes or hours preceding this
[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:36.460]   was important.
[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:38.600]   It acts as sort of like a highlighter pen
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:41.040]   in the book of experiences.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:44.960]   And I'm absolutely curious to know
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:47.640]   whether or not this is an RNA dependent mechanism
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:48.480]   in some way.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:50.180]   So is this literally like the highlighter
[02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:51.960]   in the IKEA instruction book?
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:52.800]   - This we don't know.
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:53.880]   This we don't know.
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:57.120]   And as I said, this is not even a finished work.
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:58.400]   It's not peer reviewed.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:00.840]   It's just the state that I told you about,
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:05.440]   but it's very exciting for me to go into this new field.
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.520]   And once it's out, I'd be happy to talk more about it
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.480]   and think about the implications and the connection
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:13.440]   to other things and more about the mechanisms.
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:15.680]   - Yeah, well, thank you for sharing with us
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:18.200]   despite the fact that it's not finished.
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:20.280]   People now know that it's also not finished
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:21.880]   and I love a good cliffhanger.
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:25.960]   So we await the full conclusion and interpretation
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:27.640]   of these results.
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:30.000]   Today, you've taken us on an amazing journey
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.000]   through the genome, RNA, short interfering RNAs,
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.520]   a ton of history of prior experiments,
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:38.760]   some of which ended tragically,
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.080]   many of which unfortunately did not.
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.280]   And they were true triumphs.
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:45.240]   And in particular, the work in your laboratory,
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.800]   which is just incredible.
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:48.760]   And also this introduction of model organisms.
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:52.400]   So, and I only mentioned a short handful of the things
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:54.560]   that you've taught us about today.
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:57.680]   So first I want to extend thanks for the incredible teaching.
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:00.160]   I also want to say thank you
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:03.640]   for something equally important,
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:06.120]   which is that absolutely came through,
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.240]   but is what initially brought me to explore you
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:11.600]   and your work more, although I had certainly heard of you,
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:16.040]   which is that your spirit and kind of approach to biology
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:19.880]   is an extremely unique and intoxicating one.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.800]   It's even, I venture to call it seductive.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:24.240]   It's, you know, there's a,
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:26.800]   I do believe that whether or not it's music or poetry
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:29.040]   or science or mathematics,
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:32.520]   that the spirit behind something
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:35.200]   dictates the amount of intelligence and precision
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:37.520]   with which that thing is carried out.
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:40.160]   And it absolutely comes through.
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:42.920]   So if I'm making you feel on the spot about this,
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:43.760]   I've succeeded.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:45.000]   - Thank you, thank you very much.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.680]   - But I know that the listeners can feel it.
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:49.360]   It's a felt thing.
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:50.200]   So thank you.
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:53.080]   There are many scientists out there,
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:56.520]   fewer with this phenotype and even fewer that,
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:57.760]   you know, I think that can communicate
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:00.040]   with such a articulate precision.
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:01.840]   So thank you so much.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:02.680]   - Thank you.
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:03.760]   - It's been a real pleasure.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:05.320]   - Pleasure was all mine.
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:06.160]   Thanks a lot.
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:07.120]   - Great, well, we'll do it again.
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:08.640]   And we'll learn about all the incredible things
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:11.400]   you're doing trying to transform science as it were
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:12.600]   at the level of publishing,
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:13.840]   at the level of social media,
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:15.720]   because there's a whole other discussion there.
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:16.720]   Meanwhile, we will of course,
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:18.360]   point people in the direction of you
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:20.200]   and to learn more about your work.
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:22.440]   And I look forward to hearing the conclusion
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:24.160]   of Dana's studies.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:25.000]   - Thanks a lot.
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:26.800]   It's been a real pleasure.
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:27.940]   - Thank you for joining me today
[02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:30.320]   for my discussion with Dr. Oded Rahavi
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.280]   about genetics, inheritance,
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:36.080]   the epigenome and transgenerational passage of traits.
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:38.260]   If you're learning from and are enjoying the podcast,
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:39.900]   please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
[02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:42.320]   That's a terrific zero cost way to support us.

[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:45.760]   on Spotify and Apple.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:47.240]   And on both Spotify and Apple,
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:49.520]   you can leave us up to a five-star review.
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:51.360]   If you have questions for us or comments
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:53.820]   or suggestions about topics you'd like us to cover,
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:55.100]   or guess you'd like me to include
[02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:56.520]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:58.860]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:00.720]   I do read all the comments.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:02.980]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:04.780]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:07.140]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:08.540]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:11.360]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:12.920]   we discuss supplements.
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:14.960]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:17.060]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:30:17.060 --> 02:30:18.780]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:21.300]   improving focus and for hormone support.
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:23.320]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to partner
[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:24.920]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:26.120]   We've done that for several reasons.
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:27.360]   First of all, Momentous Supplements
[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:29.020]   are the very highest quality.
[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:32.240]   Also, they tend to focus on single ingredient formulations,
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:33.840]   which makes it very straightforward
[02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:35.600]   to build the most cost-effective
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:38.300]   and biologically effective supplement regimen for you.
[02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:39.600]   We've also partnered with Momentous
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:42.140]   because we realized that many listeners of this podcast
[02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:43.940]   reside outside of the United States,
[02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:46.620]   and fortunately, Momentous ships internationally.
[02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:48.620]   If you'd like to learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.160]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:52.660]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:30:52.660 --> 02:30:55.660]   so that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:58.040]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:30:58.040 --> 02:30:59.140]   please feel free to do so.
[02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:01.420]   We are @hubermanlab on Instagram,
[02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:03.500]   Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:05.660]   And at all those places, I cover information,
[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.460]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:08.820]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:10.800]   but much of which is distinct from content
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:11.940]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:14.900]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:17.020]   The Huberman Lab Podcast also has
[02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:18.900]   a so-called neural network newsletter.
[02:31:18.900 --> 02:31:21.620]   This is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:31:21.620 --> 02:31:24.500]   that consists of podcast summaries and so-called toolkits.
[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:27.000]   And those toolkits range from things like a toolkit
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.500]   for sleep, for focus, for controlling dopamine,
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:32.460]   deliberate cold exposure, for increasing focus,
[02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:33.620]   and much, much more.
[02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:35.020]   If you want to sign up for that newsletter,
[02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:36.940]   you can go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:39.020]   go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter.
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:40.500]   You simply provide your email,
[02:31:40.500 --> 02:31:43.380]   and I assure you, we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.740]   And again, it's a completely zero-cost newsletter.
[02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:47.680]   Find it at HubermanLab.com.
[02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:50.260]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:51.940]   with Dr. Oded Rahavi.
[02:31:51.940 --> 02:31:54.300]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:56.100]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:58.680]   [upbeat music]
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:01.260]   (upbeat music)
