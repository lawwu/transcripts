[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.760]   - We are in our 10th year of the podcast now,
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.640]   coming up on 1800 episodes in the archive.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.480]   It's amazing.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.480]   And over the course of that decade,
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.840]   we've covered a lot of different topics.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.360]   And that includes the topic of birth control,
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.240]   or better put conception control.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.880]   And it's arisen three times in the podcast
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.880]   and three episodes, APJs 230, 552, and 1347.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   The most recent being three years ago.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.280]   But today we have a follow up question
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.040]   built off something you said on the podcast
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.480]   seven years ago, Pastor John.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.560]   Here it is from an anonymous woman,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.680]   a Christian, a wife and a mother.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.800]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.280]   Here's the context.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.080]   My husband and I have two wonderful boys.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.200]   I believe our family is complete.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.440]   He does too.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.360]   We have each independently decided
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.880]   that two children is enough.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.800]   I've asked my husband to consider a vasectomy.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.920]   He's interested and feels that he is done
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.960]   having children himself.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.880]   So the potential for children in a remarriage,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.560]   if death were to end our present marriage,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.920]   seems to not necessarily factor in here,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.400]   a very important argument you made
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.320]   in point number three of APJ 552.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080]   But ultimately my husband is undecided
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.200]   because he's not sure if God permits such an action.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.360]   In your view of the Bible,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.160]   is it okay for a monogamous husband and father of two
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.080]   who is done having children with me
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.240]   or any future wife to get a vasectomy?
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.320]   The older I get, the more skeptical I become
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.520]   of the freedom I think I have
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.720]   from being formed by my own culture.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.320]   Or to put it, let me put it another way.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.280]   That may not have been clear.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.800]   Let me put it in another way.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.560]   The older I get, the more suspicious I become
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   that I am more a child of my historical
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   and cultural circumstances than I once thought I was.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.880]   Now, one of the reasons I say this
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.520]   is to help people like this couple not take offense
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.600]   when I wave a yellow flag, not a red flag,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.560]   but a yellow flag, a big yellow flag,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.160]   warning us all, warning us all,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.400]   that when it comes to children and sex and family
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.320]   and personal freedom and comforts,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.320]   we are almost certainly deeply infected
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.200]   by a contemporary culture that for decades,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.040]   through television, movies, videos, advertising,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.800]   books, articles, podcasts,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.000]   has shaped our mindset about marriage and children
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and sex and freedom of the unencumbered self.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   None of us comes to the Bible with a blank slate.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.000]   In these matters, we are profoundly shaped
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   by the cultural air we breathe.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.040]   And that culture, and it's been this way for a long time,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.240]   that culture does not rejoice at the blessing of children.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.000]   It does not gladly embrace the enormous cost
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.120]   and effort of raising children in the nurture
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.640]   and admonition of the Lord.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.160]   It does not see marriage as forming a beautiful,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.680]   meaningful, lifelong, faith-building,
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.860]   character-forming matrix for growing the next generation.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.440]   It doesn't put any value on the pain
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.780]   that inevitably comes with deep covenant commitments
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.040]   to spouses and children,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.400]   but instead justifies every possible means
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.320]   of minimizing our own personal frustration and pleasure
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.400]   and maximizing personal freedom,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.960]   whether through postponing marriage or not having children
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.520]   or avoiding any kind of commitment
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.960]   or divorcing in order to get out of an uncomfortable marriage
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.440]   or neglect of children,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.400]   sticking them in some kind of institution
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.180]   while we go about our careers.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.360]   Our culture has virtually stripped the pleasures of sex
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.560]   from the place God appointed for them,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.680]   namely woven into the covenant commitments
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.240]   of lifelong marriage.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.880]   These and dozens of other ways we are all infected
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.020]   by the spirit of our times.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.020]   All of that to say, I speak with the kind of trembling
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.840]   that I may be more a child of my times than I wish.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   I try to be under the scriptures.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.720]   I want to be shaped by the scripture.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.640]   I want to be counter-cultural in a biblical way.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.680]   I want to be radical for Jesus,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.400]   but I know how inevitable it is
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.540]   that I speak from a particular cultural time, place,
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.160]   not to mention my own sinfulness and intellectual limits.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.440]   So with that confession,
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.000]   let me just rehearse briefly
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.660]   what I have said more extensively elsewhere.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.540]   I believe marriage is normative for Christians.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.080]   Normative, it's normative to be married
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.960]   because Genesis 2.18 says,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.760]   "It's not good for man to be alone."
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.840]   And because we are so wonderfully designed,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.120]   I think physically and psychologically by God
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.560]   to form covenant commitments consummated in sexual union
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.180]   with the glorious wonder of making and raising babies.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.180]   Nevertheless, though I believe that's normative,
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.240]   I can see in the life of Jesus
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.400]   and in the life of the apostle Paul and their teachings
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.500]   that marriage is not an absolute requirement of Christians,
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.580]   but that for kingdom purposes,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.440]   for God-centered, Christ-exalting,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.600]   mission-advancing, church-building,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.640]   soul-saving, sanctifying purposes,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.580]   one might choose a life of singleness.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.800]   Now by analogy,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.520]   I believe having children in marriage is normative.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.760]   Children are a great blessing.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.720]   They are one of the purposes and miracles of sexual union.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.760]   To turn away from procreation in marriage
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.640]   for the sake of some worldly gain,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.180]   rather than being motivated by God-centered,
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.880]   Christ-exalting kingdom advancement is a sin.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.400]   Nevertheless, on the analogy of marriage,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   just as for kingdom reasons, singleness may be chosen,
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.120]   it is possible for Christ's sake and for holy purposes
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.080]   that limiting the number of children would be chosen also.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.400]   The principle in both cases,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.980]   getting married and having children,
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.400]   is one of self-denying, Christ-exalting,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.160]   mission-advancing motivation.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.080]   What's your motivation?
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.560]   Rather than simply following the course of the age
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   in order to maximize worldly freedoms and worldly comforts.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.800]   Now, that puts a huge burden on all of us
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.320]   to honestly know our own hearts, doesn't it?
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.260]   Search me, oh God, and know my thoughts,
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.960]   and see if there be any wicked way in me
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.880]   governing these choices.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.960]   This must be our cry,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.400]   because we are all so prone to come up with a theology
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.080]   and an ethics that justify our desires.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.180]   So, I think you can see in these observations
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:17.160]   that I don't regard all birth control,
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.340]   or better, conception control, as sinful.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:27.800]   Using abortifacients that kill a conceived child
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   would be sin, but choosing not to conceive
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.040]   may not be a sin, which means, it seems to me,
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   that the methods and the timing of such choices
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.960]   will become a matter of biblically
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.080]   and medically informed wisdom.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.940]   So, what would my advice be that might contribute
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.600]   to the wisdom of this couple,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.820]   besides what I've tried to say?
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.680]   Let me pick one sentence from what they wrote,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.520]   or she wrote, I think the wife is writing for them together.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.000]   She says, quote, "I've asked my husband
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.660]   "to consider a vasectomy.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:21.760]   "He's interested and feels that he is done having children,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.900]   "so the potential for children in a remarriage,
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.340]   "if death were to end our present marriage,
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:32.040]   "seems not necessarily to factor in here," end of quote.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.240]   Three questions about that sentence.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.400]   First, the word feels.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.040]   He feels that he is done having children.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.900]   Feelings are notoriously temporary,
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.440]   and even if she had said he thinks that he is done,
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.240]   I would say the same thing.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.240]   We just don't know in such circumstances
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.740]   what may happen in our lives
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.740]   that would make an irreversible sterilization tragic.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.020]   Second question, the word seems.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.200]   She says, "The potential for children in a remarriage,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.980]   "if death were to end our present marriage,
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.740]   "seems not to necessarily factor in here."
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.560]   Seems is a pretty weak word.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.340]   Death is a real possibility in a marriage,
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.560]   and in that case, remarriage would both be likely
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.720]   and, I think, good.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.400]   How does he know what his heart would say
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.880]   in that new marriage?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   How does he know?
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.160]   It seems that it may not be a factor.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.280]   Well, that's pretty flimsy.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.140]   Third, nothing is said about the wife
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.920]   in that possible new marriage.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.180]   Seems like you are only taking into account
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.520]   your own preferences about whether you would want children
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.000]   in that new marriage.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.140]   What about hers?
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.940]   And be careful about assuming that you're too old
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.180]   to become a parent.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.700]   Noelle and I adopted when I was 50.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.700]   What if a 50-year-old man marries a 35-year-old single woman
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.700]   who deeply longs, has always dreamed of giving birth
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.500]   to her own child?
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.300]   So my fallible contribution to your effort
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.040]   to act biblically, and I admire you for it,
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.780]   and to act wisely is to simply say,
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.740]   one, search your hearts so that your decision
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.060]   to have no more children is a Christ honoring decision,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.880]   a mission advancing decision.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.060]   Second, be very slow to implement that decision
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.420]   with a kind of sterilization that would cut off
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.060]   godly future possibilities, which you cannot presently see.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.960]   And maybe just one other word of counsel.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.780]   Sit down together and open your Bible
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.780]   and read the first 12 verses of Psalm 25.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.900]   I say that because I don't know any other passage
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.900]   of scripture that is better for putting into words
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.380]   our cry for guidance and wisdom from God.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.140]   - Thank you for that caution, Pastor John,
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.300]   and thank you for listening to this episode.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.660]   This episode is a follow-up question
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.620]   built off a previous episode, a 2015 one of ours,
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.660]   titled, "Is Permanent Birth Control a Sin?"
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.260]   That was APJ 552.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.700]   I would commend that episode to you,
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.580]   along with episodes 230 and 1347.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.860]   You can find all three, APJs 230, 552, and 1347
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.860]   at our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.540]   and we will see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.580]   Have a great weekend.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:15.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
