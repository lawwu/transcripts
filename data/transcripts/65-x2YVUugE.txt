[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Well, you're talking about three very different actors there.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.240]   Wait, David, David, behind you is your security cameras are on. Do you want to turn those off?
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.440]   Yeah, I don't know. Hold on a second.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.920]   You sit there and watch those all day? Security apparatus.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.560]   What is this guy, the Batman?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160]   He sits in that couch all day and watches.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.320]   Did you see that behind him? It was so dystopian. Oh my gosh.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.760]   You must have caught some crazy shit on those security cameras. What do you do with that
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.560]   footage?
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:56.960]   Okay, everybody, welcome to episode 150 of the all in podcast. Yes, we've made it to 150 episodes
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.400]   somehow, talking about technology, business, and of course, politics. And this week, we will
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.280]   continue our discussion, tragically about the situation Israel and the war with Hamas,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.760]   and a lot of the downstream effects of what's going on here and try to make sense of the world
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.680]   as we do. We gave a disclaimer last week, we're not experts. And I suspect many of you are not
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.400]   experts on this, but we're going to try to talk about the heart topic here and do it in good faith.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   And then we will move on to topics that don't have to do with the war in Gaza. That could by the time
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.240]   you read this again, another disclaimer, by the time you listen to this podcast, a ground invasion
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.200]   may or may not have started. We take these on Thursdays, and you listen to generally speaking
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.080]   on Saturdays and Sundays. With me again this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sachs, and of course,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   David Friedberg. And gentlemen, I'm just going around the horn here quick before I tee up the
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.880]   first topic. How's everybody feeling about the events in the 10 days since 10.7 and the terrorist
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.200]   attack that occurred in Israel? I skipped last week. I was too emotional to do the show, just
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:30.480]   so folks know. It was difficult to see what I saw on the internet and the reporting. I think I was
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:41.200]   really moved. Because I thought a lot about the like, how lucky we are. And I thought about my
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:51.600]   children and seeing what I saw and being a parent. It's really different. I remember 9/11,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   it was really shocking. I was really upset from 9/11 as well. But when I saw the events last week,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.520]   it immediately projected onto my kids and the care I try and take for my kids and thinking about
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.680]   the experience of other people in this situation. I was also, I'll be honest, really moved
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.600]   and saddened because of the bombing of children in Gaza. And I was really saddened
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:30.080]   that there were innocent children suffering there as well. And the whole thing just felt so horrific
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.720]   to me. I don't think about the justification or the morality of one side over another. I was just
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.080]   more moved. Because I felt really sad about the experience of a lot of families and a lot of
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.680]   children caught in the middle, caught in this in this environment. So I was I was pretty hurt last
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.120]   week, I was in a really bad state, and I couldn't do the show. I think, you know, time has allowed
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.720]   me to kind of become a bit rational about things and try and understand where things are headed.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.080]   And it's a really complicated, confusing situation. And it's really sad. I worry a lot
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.320]   about where things are headed, not just in the Middle East, but also domestically,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.720]   coming out of this conflict. So that's where I'm at.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.200]   Yeah. And thank you for sharing. I wasn't sure if you would share your absence last week. And
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.280]   I think it's fair. I too have been thinking about my own children. And it's at 9/11. And it's,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.920]   it's very dark. And so it's hard to talk about. But we're making progress here, I think. And today
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.960]   we'll talk about a lot of the issues, Chamath or Saxe, any opening thoughts before we get started,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.320]   delving into what's actually happening. And then more importantly, I think, where this is heading,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.600]   and what the possible outcome or resolution could be if there is a resolution here.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.160]   I think things are getting better, actually, I think, okay, from where,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.240]   if you had to graph your expectations of how bad things could get, I think what most people would
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.440]   probably say is somewhere last week, there was a scepter of some potential World War Three-like
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:22.640]   contagion. And I think in general, it hasn't stopped some of the bloodshed, but the extent
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.120]   to which we expected this thing to escalate, it actually hasn't happened. And so if you take a
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.480]   step back, and you kind of calmly and coldly look at the facts, I think that there are a lot of
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.240]   people on all sides trying to maintain their composure in a moment where there's a lot of
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.760]   brush fires. So I actually think that this has been
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:59.440]   much, much better than it could have been. And so I'm generally optimistic that we're
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.040]   going to find our way out of this. So, Saxe, any thoughts?
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.480]   Well, to be honest, I can't be as optimistic as Chamath. It's true that World War Three
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.600]   hasn't started yet. But I think the situation is incredibly volatile still. Just the last
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:21.200]   couple of days, the headline story was an explosion or bombing of this hospital in Gaza.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.640]   Blame immediately fell on Israel. The claim in the New York Times was that
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.520]   they had dropped a bomb on it from a plane. Social media was aflame with that. I think in the last
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   day or so, the perspective seems to be changing. There's video now showing that it wasn't the
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   hospital, but rather the parking lot next to the hospital that took the brunt of the damage.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.920]   I think that it's far from clear that Israel did it. A lot of people are blaming Islamic Jihad.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.760]   In any event, it's very unclear. So I'm going to continue to do what I've done,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.400]   which is suspend judgment until there can be some sort of proper investigation of what happened,
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.640]   and we find out exactly who's really responsible. But it does seem that over the last day or so,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.440]   there's been now a backing off of the idea that Israel was definitely responsible for this.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:21.680]   Nonetheless, you saw immediately in the wake of that story coming out that there were protests
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:30.960]   and riots all over the Middle East. The Arab Street was absolutely ignited. And I think that
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.600]   the Arab Street's not going to be convinced that Israel wasn't responsible for this. I just think
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   that they're convinced. And I think partisans on both sides are convinced about who did it,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.520]   and they're going to be immune to whatever evidence comes out. So I think that's kind
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.720]   of the situation we're at right now. I would consider the riots that we just saw in regards
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.440]   to the hospital and the eruption on social media to be a prelude or dress rehearsal of what we can
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.080]   expect to happen almost every day if Israel proceeds with the ground invasion of Gaza. Now,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.560]   they haven't done that yet. And that's why the situation seems tenuous, but stable. But we're
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.760]   still waiting to find out if Israel's going to go into Gaza. And if they do, I think all bets are
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.920]   off in terms of where this is going. This was my biggest concern last week. I think the thing I was
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:34.720]   most anxious about was that the imagery that would come out of Gaza with the action from Israel
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:44.960]   would be the fodder for escalation worldwide, that there's this perception already with half a
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.840]   billion people, maybe 2 billion people, maybe more, that there's an oppressor and there's an oppressed
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.240]   and the oppressed is suffering under the oppressor, and that there would be the creation of fodder to
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.120]   support that narrative. And I think that the hospital bombing, the kind of point I made to
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.440]   someone who reached out to me two days ago or yesterday about it, was I don't know if it matters
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   that we get the corrections from all these people that may have said something that turns out to not
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.760]   be true. Because it was almost like that media became confirmation bias for people that already
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.520]   felt that this is what was going on. And this is simply evidence of what is going on. And it
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:36.000]   justifies the next step. It justifies the beliefs, it justifies the morality. And I don't think that
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.560]   if it wasn't this, it's something it's going to be something else, there is a tinderbox ready to be
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.920]   lit. And that tinderbox is just looking for a match. And whether it's this match or the next
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.360]   match, there's going to be a match. And the tinderbox will be lit. I think that a large number
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.760]   of people feel like they're on the right side, if everyone thinks they're on the right side of
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.800]   something, everyone feels like they have the right moral stance that there is a regime on the other
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.480]   side that has the wrong moral stance, I am good, you are evil. And therefore, anything I see,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:14.240]   is my confirmation bias for my belief. And it'll it gives me permission to take the next step.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:22.000]   And in that framework, it will only escalate. And we are only going to a dark place. And I think
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.200]   like the real question for me to Chamath's optimism is, what are the muting factors? What
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:34.000]   are the factors where one side feels like they're getting something that forces them to say, I'm not
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.320]   going to take the next step, I'm not going to justify the next step. And it's a it's a really
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.280]   hard question to answer at this stage. Let's, let's take that other side and just explore it
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.840]   for a second. So the question that I've been asking myself is, because I agree with you,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.880]   it doesn't matter who was responsible for this bombing, because it's already been defined.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.360]   And yeah, but in a moral sense, it does just, you know, in a moral sense, it does. But I'm saying
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.920]   practically in the theatre of war and the theatres near the war, it doesn't matter, because it's
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:12.480]   about how is it framed. And to your point, people have already made up their minds. The pro Israel
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.600]   side have made up their mind and the pro Palestinian side has made up their mind. But the
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:26.160]   question that I asked myself is, okay, is that how much of an incremental escalation is it from
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:33.680]   what their status quo is? You know, one of the interesting things I learned from the Jared
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.960]   Kushner interview with Lex Friedman, it's like, a lot of this tension, you can trace back to
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.560]   the Al Aqsa mosque, and all of the misinformation around that, right, he spends a section of that
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.400]   podcast talking about how that's been framed and reframe the myths and disinformation to basically
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.960]   get people fervently up in arms. And it turns out that it isn't under the supervision of the
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.400]   Israelis. And in fact, you know, you can go get a visa to visit Al Aqsa mosque, and it's under the
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:13.280]   custodianship of the King of Jordan, as an example. So that is the fact. But those facts aren't
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:19.600]   necessarily shared on the ground. And that is where a lot of this original tension comes from.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.520]   So then I asked myself, Okay, well, if that's been lingering for decades,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:30.960]   how much more incrementally bad does it get for this specific thing? And I think you see it in
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.520]   people's actions, which is, they try to use it to escalate. And my honest measurement of that
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.880]   escalation is that outside of the actual theatre of war, most of these escalations died down pretty
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.920]   quickly. Now, if all of these embassies were overrun, and all of a sudden, you saw a Beirut
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.560]   like situation, right, the US embassy in Beirut in the early 80s, I would agree with you that this
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.480]   is getting really bad really quickly. But that's not what we saw. And I think what that speaks to
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.840]   more is how much hatred is actually in the heart of people versus not. And so I think that this
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:17.040]   was a moment for people to channel their anxiety and some of their aggression and some of their
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.600]   hatred towards America or Israel. But what it didn't was escalate. You didn't see these embassies
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.360]   get burned to the ground, you didn't see people getting dragged out. And so I'm not trying to
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.880]   justify that behaviour. I'm just trying to look at it in an absolute sense and answer the question,
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:42.800]   is it escalating? Or is it not escalating? And my assessment right now is that it is not escalating.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.400]   I saw on Sunday, something that I thought I would never see, which is Iran put out a press release
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.240]   through the United Nations to Israel. You haven't seen that that's de escalatory. That's not an
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.040]   escalatory action from a country whose mission statement includes the destruction and demise of
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:06.560]   a country. So I think when push comes to shove, there are a lot of people in positions of power
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:14.800]   who understand the stakes here and are trying their best on both sides. And I hate this word,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.280]   so I can't even believe I'm about to use it to find some proportionality and try to de escalate.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:27.760]   That's how I measure and judge what I see. Over the last week, a lot of people use labels to
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:35.200]   characterize the actions, the tonality, the behaviour of the other side, because every
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.680]   everyone believes that they're on the right side. And the point of view that there is hate and anger
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.280]   on the other side comes from a place not out of the blue hate and anger doesn't just emerge
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.000]   from nothing. It typically comes from a place of deep hurt. I think the biggest question for me is
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   how do you resolve the deep hurt that is being felt and has been felt by either side over a
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.320]   very long period of time? It's the hardest thing to answer because what do you give millions of
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:14.960]   people that have lived feeling hurt for so long, feeling challenged for so long, that makes them
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.200]   feel resolved in that sense. And I get that you're speaking about the Palestinian people.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   I'm speaking about the Israeli people too. Okay, and I'm speaking about the fact that like,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.960]   these actions don't, they don't come out of the blue. They don't come out of a place of
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   like greed. Let's go to an example in our own lives. Let's just say that we have a friend or
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:43.680]   you know, we had a girlfriend at some point, where there is a deep betrayal. Okay, and then there's
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:53.120]   just an unrelenting anger. To your point before you can talk about the hurt, you have to deescalate
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.960]   the anger. So there has to be an active process of deescalation before you can actually resolve
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.840]   this stuff. I thought Israel was quite clear last week, we are going into Gaza on Sunday.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:11.680]   But then they didn't. That seemed deescalatory. Again, I'll just say it again. Iran puts out a
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:18.800]   press release to Israel through the UN. That seemed deescalatory. There was a moment where
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:26.080]   Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Biden were supposed to meet, they ended up not meeting in
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:34.160]   Amman. But that seemed deescalatory. Biden, Tony Blinken, Tony refused to leave the IDF until he
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.320]   got some assurances about humanitarian aid into Gaza. That seems deescalatory. Biden spending time
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.200]   and then reiterating those assurances from Netanyahu. Again, all of this stuff seems like
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:52.400]   both sides are in the middle of all of this chaos, not trying to light the tinderbox. And it doesn't
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.760]   mean that they're on a path to resolution. But I just think that they understand the stakes.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:04.960]   Saks, when we look at the hospital situation specifically, and the fog of war, you had the
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:14.080]   New York Times getting attacked for maybe taking Hamas's word for it, then flipping and then now
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:20.160]   there is conspiracy theory, the United States is, you know, carrying water for Israel and
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.320]   then the fog of war, oh, my goodness, we maybe the hospital wasn't even hit it was in the
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.920]   it was in the parking lot. And so it didn't even get hit. So when we look at all of that,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.480]   and then Shamad says, Hey, wait, things haven't escalated. I actually, I happen to be here in
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.040]   Dubai right now on a business trip. And I'll explain some of the feedback I've gotten from
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:50.960]   people who are Palestinian, ethnically, or Jordanian and of Palestinian descent, I should
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.600]   say, and we'll get into that in a second. The ground war hasn't happened. And this seems to be
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.360]   one of the as Chamath is pointing out, it's fascinating that it hasn't because it was
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   supposed to have happened already. Do you have any thoughts on why it hasn't happened?
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.560]   One of the conspiracy theories and I hate to go down these roads because in the fog of war,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.920]   I think people try to fill a vacuum. And then of course, as you were pointing out,
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.720]   Chamath and Freiburg, people then use it as evidence for their side, the people here in
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.080]   Dubai, a number of people have pointed out this ground war is not going to happen, that it's
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:31.040]   saber rattling, but Israel is going to black back down and get the hostages back. And this has been
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.280]   told to me by many people. I know, I don't know if that's wishful thinking, or some kind of
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.680]   conspiracy theory. But But what do you take from the ground war not happening? And then if you want
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.160]   to go back and touch on the fog of war issue here with things flipping back and forth, and what is
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.520]   actual reality, and just broadly speaking, escalating or de escalating?
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.000]   Look, I think that there's a few possible reasons why Israel hasn't gone in yet. Number one is they
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.240]   may perceive it to be a very difficult military operation. They're almost certainly walking into
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.960]   a trap, there's going to be ambushes everywhere, snipers, IEDs. Hamas has an elaborate tunnel
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.880]   network, they can disappear down that tunnel network when the fighting gets too hot, they can
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:17.760]   booby trap the access points. They've got anti-tank weapons, they can take out armored vehicles.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:23.680]   It's going to be a very difficult fight for the Israelis. And so they may be taking a pause here
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.360]   just to assess that situation, and maybe get organized for it, or maybe think better of it.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.440]   So they may be either stopping to organize or getting cold feet. I think second, they have to
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:41.280]   think through the consequences of going in there. Hezbollah has basically threatened to open up a
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:49.200]   northern front and invade Israel if Israel goes into Gaza. You also saw, as we saw with the reaction
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.480]   to the hospital bombing, that they have to be concerned about the Arab street erupting.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.160]   And again, if they go into Gaza, this could ignite the whole Arab world. It seems to me
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.720]   that if you're Israel, you don't want to become the focal point for all of this anger in the Arab
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.840]   or larger Muslim world. There are important differences in that world. There's differences
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:19.120]   between Sunnis and Shiite. There's differences between Arabs and Persians and Turks. And the
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.600]   last thing you want is to paper over all those differences by having everybody's
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.400]   anger targeted at you. So I think there's very big consequences that could follow. Geopolitically,
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.200]   I think, again, the war would almost certainly not just be a single front war against Gaza,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.120]   it could turn into a multi-front war. So that's, I think, the second reason. I think the third
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.280]   reason is you have to believe that there's furious diplomacy going on behind the scenes.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:49.440]   And I think this is what Chamath is referring to. What we don't know, obviously, are the content of
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.280]   those conversations. We don't know what the Biden administration has told the Netanyahu government.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   We don't know if they've said to them, "Listen, we are not going to get involved in this."
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.720]   Publicly, they've said that we stand with Israel, but you just have to wonder
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.960]   what they're privately telling the Israelis. All of that being said, I think that Israel has
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:17.040]   declared that it's at war with Hamas. There are these stories that are coming out daily of these
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.920]   atrocities that were perpetrated by Hamas. I saw once by paramedics who discovered the bodies
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:28.080]   and described the way they were tortured. The population of Israel demands retribution.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.600]   And so Netanyahu is under intense domestic political pressure to deliver on that.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.440]   So I think that Chamath is right that things haven't escalated yet, but I wouldn't say they've
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.920]   de-escalated. Blinken did demand and Biden did announce those relieving of some of the humanitarian
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.360]   issues in Gaza. But to my knowledge, they have not been implemented yet.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.040]   They turned the water back on, I believe.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   Okay, so I think this thing is still a powder keg and it could erupt.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.840]   And again, it all comes back to this key question of does Israel go into Gaza or not? If they don't,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:08.000]   then I think that creates room for some sort of international diplomatic effort to get the
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.600]   hostages back and maybe de-escalate the situation. And I guess we'll find out over the next week or
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.480]   so. And that you didn't even mention that there could be some deep diplomacy here going on in
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.520]   terms of releasing the hostages and maybe somehow they believe if they go in too early,
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   the chances of getting those hostages out alive could be seriously diminished. Yeah.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.520]   You know, it's strange to me that I just don't hear that much about the hostages. It seems like
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.600]   the Israeli population, just in terms of what they're publicly saying,
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   seems to have almost written off the hostages. There was some video of the
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.240]   families of hostages being upset that they don't feel like the government response is adequately
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.720]   taking the interests of their families into account, that they just seem hell bent on
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.600]   this invasion of Gaza. But, you know, we don't know what's happening behind the scenes. And
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.480]   again, that would be the way to de-escalate this is you get an international effort
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:09.360]   to release the hostages in exchange for maybe it can't be stated, but a quid pro quo where
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.280]   Israel does not go into Gaza on the ground, and maybe the bombing stops.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.320]   Yeah. Okay. So, maybe we can pivot discussion here to...
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.640]   I will say, just let me make one other point here. Delving into the internal politics of another
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.840]   country is not something that we typically like to do or that Americans are particularly good at.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:34.000]   But when a situation like this happens, that could drag us into a war. We do have to kind
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.640]   of understand the internal dynamics of these countries. Israel is a country that for the
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.120]   last several years has been very internally divided. There's been something like five
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:53.200]   elections in the last four years. Netanyahu got reelected in December of 2022 by creating a new
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:00.400]   coalition with far-right elements of the Israeli political system. And Chamath, you mentioned the
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:07.200]   Al-Aqsa Mosque, and I know Jared's take on this was that he thought that this was blown out of
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.960]   proportion. But I'll give you a different perspective on this. I've just been researching
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:19.600]   this. If you read Al Jazeera, what they point to is the emergence of a far-right figure named
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:26.240]   Itamar Ben-Gavir, who has become a member of Netanyahu's government as a result of this
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:34.320]   coalition that was forged in December. And Ben-Gavir has been... Previously, he was a fringe,
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.880]   sort of anti-Palestinian, far-right provocateur. When he was 19 years old, he basically had
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:46.000]   somehow stolen or taken the hood ornament from Yitzhak Rabin, the then prime minister's car,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.480]   and was waving it around saying that, "If we can get to your car, we can get to you."
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:58.400]   Three weeks later, Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a far-right religious extremist in Israel
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.120]   because they felt that he had committed treason by signing the Oslo Accords. Now, Ben-Gavir wasn't
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.800]   implicated himself, but it gives you a sense of kind of where he's coming from. And Ben-Gavir
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:16.720]   has led, over the past year, several incursions into the Al-Aqsa Mosque area. And the reason he
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:24.000]   said he's done this is to show that the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, the Haram al-Sharif,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.520]   which is the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina, he says that that is under the
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.280]   sovereignty of Israel, that that belongs to Israel. There is also a faction of the Israeli far-right
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.000]   that wants to build the third temple on the Temple Mount. You have to understand that that cannot
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.440]   happen while the Al-Aqsa Mosque is still there. So, you have these, I don't mind saying, crazies.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:55.520]   I mean, to destroy or even to imply that you would ever destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque is such an
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.600]   explosive issue. It would turn the entire Muslim world against Israel, and basically, I think it
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.840]   would be the end of Israel. But you have these figures who've now been incorporated into Netanyahu's
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:12.160]   cabinet. And they are, I think, far to the right of Netanyahu, but they are preferring Netanyahu.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.600]   They seem to be baying for some sort of religious war. So, you know, the domestic policies of another
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.480]   country is not something that we're totally familiar with, but you have to understand that
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:29.440]   Israel does have these elements. And man, I hope that the Biden administration is telling Netanyahu
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.760]   that, yeah, we stand with Israel, but not if you're going to follow the advice of these far
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.200]   right religious extremists. Jared: This is, I think, a very important point to pause on here
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:49.600]   and maybe unpack, which is, as I said, I'm here in Dubai and had this trip planned. And I'm actually
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.200]   – Rod: Tell us what you're hearing. What are you hearing? What do people say?
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:27:00.160]   Jared: Yes, fascinating. And this is going to get a little touchy. And so, I just want to be clear,
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:06.000]   I'm going to tell people what the conversations are here. It's not necessarily me endorsing any of
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.880]   these positions. And again, I'm no expert, of course. And on Saturday night, I went to a bat
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.480]   mitzvah, my friends, daughters had their bat mitzvah. And on Tuesday night, I had dinner –
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.680]   Rod: Sorry, where? In Israel?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.920]   Jared: No, in the Bay Area. And then I flew here, and this juxtaposition where I had dinner last
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:33.760]   night with five Jordanians who are of Palestinian descent. And they universally are appalled by
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:42.160]   Hamas and what happened, right? So, just say that right out front. And then they are perplexed
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:49.440]   why there is no discussion in the West in America of the conditions that could have led to this and
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:55.120]   the treatment of the Palestinian people who they believe are living in apartheid. And that word is
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:01.040]   used over and over again. And that they have, you know, now a generation of people who have no hope,
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.000]   and a generation of people who have nothing to lose, and that they have nothing to live for.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.200]   And this is the piece of the discussion that has gotten a lot of people in the West, I think,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.600]   in trouble talking about it. We had a conference producer who was tweeting, hey, listen, you know,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:26.240]   very early on, like on 10/7, Israel has to abide by, you know, international law, etc. And this
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:34.560]   came up over and over again, from Muslims here in Dubai, that the West is not, in the free world,
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:40.480]   is not holding Israel accountable to human rights standards, basic standard tenets of war.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.000]   And I was coming into the trip a little bit more positive. And now, there's such a deep hurt
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.640]   on both sides of this that I got to see, you know, from both of these events and people suffering,
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:59.440]   that my normally positive outlook has been a little bit shaken, if I'm being honest,
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:07.120]   this feels very intractable to me. And, yeah, to even go near the topic of
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.440]   what has Israel contributed to this situation, and the treatment of the Palestinian people.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:19.840]   That's what the people in the region want to hear us talk about or just hear the world talk about
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.360]   any reaction to some of the protests that happened in Europe and the people that took to the streets,
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.760]   what was their perspective on that? I think their perspective is a very small percentage
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   of Americans care about the Palestinian people. And, you know, if you look at the surveys that
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.760]   have gone on, and I have some of the survey data that's been done, and I'm not sure Americans
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:48.400]   views on this are the most important views for us to be focused on, but a very small percentage
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:54.480]   of people are aligned with the Palestinian people, as opposed to the state of Israel.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.440]   So well, I mean, the biggest challenge and finding a path
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:04.320]   towards, I don't want to just be so generic and say the word peace.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.520]   No, I think that's the word. Yeah.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   But towards some form of understanding and settlement with each other is that
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:16.320]   there's a framing right now that you have to pick a side. You're not allowed to be pro Israel,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:23.200]   and also be sympathetic and empathetic to the plight of the children in Gaza. You're not allowed
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:30.080]   to say, I'm looking out for the Palestinians, but I believe Israel should have a state. You're not
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:36.720]   allowed to point out the fact that there are multiple Muslim majority countries, and there's
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:44.800]   only one Jewish state, while also saying that what the Israelis have done may also not be right.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.920]   You're not allowed to take a nuanced point of view, and you're not allowed to address
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:57.440]   the variance in behavior over time with each of these different sides, and how there is a massive,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:03.680]   complicated mess here, that it has to be pick your side, you're pro Israeli, we need to wipe out
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.800]   x, y, or z, or you're anti Israeli, and as a result, you're anti Semite.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   And the fact that we conflate all of these things together and force people to jump on a side is
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.960]   what is also escalating that we can't actually have conversations around these topics that it
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.480]   all ends up being pick a side. And then let's figure out how many people and what resources
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.280]   are on one side and what people and what resources are on the other. And I think that this notion
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:35.360]   that we have almost a cancel culture behavior, that's now leached into this discourse,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:42.240]   that if you try and talk about the plight of Palestinians, you cannot also be pro Israel
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:48.400]   is what's keeping us from making progress in finding a path to resolution. And I think that's
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:54.800]   the biggest issue right now. And we leverage the you're not a loyalist. You're not moral.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:04.480]   You're not a good person. You're evil. If you don't stand on our side, and both sides are act
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:11.440]   that way. And it's that's the hardest thing to change. It's I think the only way to find a path
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.960]   is to change that first. And I think starting with empathy is the only way but man, that's
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.680]   impossible right now. Fucking impossible. Yeah, it's hard. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just I'm just
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.960]   super like, wow, I'm super emotional about this, because I just don't like that, like,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:32.480]   you know, so there are, broadly speaking, two factions that we're seeing out in the streets,
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.680]   either denouncing Israel or supporting the Palestinians. I think there is a group of
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.120]   people who genuinely hate Jews or hate Israel and do not believe in Israel's right to exist,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and are preaching things like decolonization, which is a recipe for for genocide. Then there
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.680]   are people and probably a larger group who I think are concerned with the plight of the Palestinian
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:02.400]   people who recognize the conditions they have is deplorable, and that the tactics that Israel uses
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.480]   to enforce its security, whether it's the occupation of the West Bank or the blockade of
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:15.280]   Gaza, are unsustainable and create unfair conditions for the Palestinians. So in other words,
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.760]   they're not saying that Israel doesn't have a right to exist, they are principally concerned
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.120]   with helping the Palestinians and achieving a Palestinian state. It seems to me of paramount
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:33.920]   importance that Israel separate these two groups by understanding the concern and I would apply
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.800]   this to American leadership as well, by understanding the concerns of the latter,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.040]   and hopefully getting us on a path to resolving them.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.520]   Totally.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.080]   So as to isolate the haters.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.960]   Totally.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.440]   Because otherwise, this whole thing is headed towards a gigantic disaster where,
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.560]   and I think it's a disaster for Israel, most of all, is that Israel could be destroyed.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.880]   But I think the whole world is being asked to pick a side too. And that's where this escalates into
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.600]   a much bigger, broader conflict. It's that...
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.560]   Yeah, and in the position...
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.840]   Every country, and even within the US, we're being asked to pick a side and now we're seeing
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.280]   civil unrest in the US.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   The frustration as well amongst people who are Muslim or who are Palestinian descent or Jordanian,
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   or just in the region generally, is that Hamas set this process back decades. And there's like a
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.240]   great frustration that maybe some progress was being made, and that we could come to some normalcy
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:36.720]   in a two state solution, and that Hamas did this exactly because so much progress has been made
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.280]   recently.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.520]   I think that is the best theory about why this happened now is that there was a process of
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.720]   normalization happening between Israel and a number of these Arab states. And we talked about
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.960]   it last week, that Jared Kushner set this in motion. There were three or four deals that
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.720]   were signed between Israel and the Gulf Arab states, bringing about normal relations and
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:03.520]   Saudi Arabia was on the table as being the next one. There was a effort underway to negotiate
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:10.480]   a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia that is now completely on ice.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.600]   And at risk of the other agreements maybe being ripped up, because if Israel goes in and has a
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.320]   massive ground invasion, and there's more suffering and death, that that will maybe
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.760]   blow all those accords up.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.480]   I think that what Hamas may have been concerned about to the extent you want to impute strategic
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.160]   logic to their decisions, even those decisions are atrocities, but if they have a strategic
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:40.080]   purpose in mind, it's to derail that process of normalization. Because if the entire Arab
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.640]   world basically normalized relations with Israel before the Palestinian question is resolved,
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:51.440]   it takes a major carrot off the table in their negotiations or whatever they want to achieve.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.120]   So I think that to thwart that process was a big part of the goal here. But I do think that
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:05.920]   what this has shown is that getting to a larger Middle East peace without resolving the
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.480]   Palestinian question is likely to be a failed strategy. I just don't know.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.360]   It's impossible.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.560]   It's impossible. And so
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.200]   It's impossible.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:19.520]   Again, this does not justify anything Hamas did. But I think that what these events have now
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:27.280]   created is a dynamic where the Palestinian question is now front and center and everything
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.800]   else is basically paused until this gets resolved. Now, I just want to say something about the two
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.360]   state process. Again, I was doing some research. There really hasn't been any work on the two state
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.840]   solution for roughly a decade. Obama was the last president who tried. He explicitly said
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:51.600]   that Israel should try to make peace based on the 1967 lines, but with land swaps to accommodate for
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.560]   the changes that have happened on the map since then. Netanyahu was very irate at that formulation,
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.920]   by the way. He never had a good relationship with Obama because of that. And then John Kerry,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.800]   who is Secretary of State under Obama, made a major effort to try and bring about a two state
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:13.600]   solution. And frankly, it went nowhere. And a big part of the reason why is that Netanyahu said
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:20.720]   that, "Listen, the only situation that's acceptable to Israel from a security standpoint
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.880]   is that we must control all security west of the Jordan River." So in other words,
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.600]   we must control security in the West Bank. And his argument was that, "Look,
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.320]   adjacent land is very important. If you create a Palestinian state there where they have total
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.440]   sovereignty over their own security, they could be digging tunnels under the wall." He basically
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:44.560]   said it could turn into 20 Gazas. And he's got his point of view. And when people challenged him
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.360]   on this, he said, "Listen, you don't live here. We live here. We understand the security situation."
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.200]   That's what he said to John Kerry. So the whole process fell apart. And since then, the idea has
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.400]   been for Israel to move forward, again, on this larger normalization project with the rest of the
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.000]   Middle East, putting the Palestinian question to one side. The idea has basically been, "Listen,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.680]   if you won't make peace with us," and this goes back to Arafat at Camp David,
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   turning down the deal that was on the table that Clinton brokered with Ehud Barak,
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.760]   "If you won't make a deal with us, we'll just go around you. You're too rejectionist. You're
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.320]   too difficult. You're too hard to make a deal with. So we're just gonna put that to one side."
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:31.680]   And that really has been the process for the last decade, I would say. Since John Kerry's
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:37.600]   initiative fell apart, the process has been starting with Kushner under Trump, and then,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.960]   I think, Biden tried to extend it by brokering the Saudi Arabia deal. The idea was, "Let's put
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.080]   the Palestinian question to one side. We'll work on these other deals." I think now that that
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:54.160]   process has fallen apart. So the two-state solution, that process died back in 2014.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.120]   This idea of going around has basically fallen apart now. And so I think this is why people
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.720]   are pretty pessimistic about where things go from here is, what is the process? And meanwhile,
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.320]   you have this hard shift inside Israeli domestic politics to the right. You've got these religious
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:16.160]   factions who believe that the entirety of the West Bank, what they call Judea and Samaria,
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.520]   is their God-given right. And if you go back to the Netanyahu's government forming in December
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:29.200]   of 2022, their first plank was to say that Judea and Samaria belong to us, we have sovereignty
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.360]   over them, we're not giving them up. So what room is there for compromise? And since then,
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.840]   they've been expanding the settlements in the West Bank.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.080]   Let me ask you a question, just to shift the question for a second. The thing that
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:50.640]   surprised me the most over this past week were the extent of the protests, some violent,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.160]   in the United States and in Western Europe. And I'm curious to hear from you guys,
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:02.560]   was that overwhelmingly about pro-Palestine and making sure that there wasn't a human rights
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:12.240]   atrocity in Gaza? Or was that a emergence of like, a simmering anti-Semitism that we hadn't seen?
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.960]   Well, both. That's kind of my point is there's type one and type two. Type one is the true
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:23.040]   hatred, it's the denial of the Israeli right to exist. However, there's a type two, which is
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:28.240]   legitimate concern over the condition of the Palestinians and the desire to resolve that by
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.920]   creating a Palestinian state. And until you separate those two things, you're not gonna
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:38.000]   make progress. Your type two can breed a type one is the real scary reality.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.680]   The simmering anti-Semitism.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:46.320]   That you can have a legitimate concern about the people of Palestine, because you always are going
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:52.480]   to be concerned about the oppressed, being oppressed by the oppressor. And that then
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:58.240]   translates into an anti-Semitism, because you say that it's the Jewish people that are perpetrating
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:04.480]   this upon those people, therefore, the Jewish people need to go. And I've heard friends of
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:10.880]   mine in the last week, who have said awful things like all Muslims need to go. Well known,
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:17.040]   well respected public people have said this to me in private, I can see where the hatred can come
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.240]   from a place of hurt. I can see that when people feel sympathetic towards the Palestinian plight,
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:29.120]   they can then turn into anti-Semitism. And so I do think that there are two distinct groups today.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:34.240]   But my concern is that just like what happened in the past, that that can then breed into
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:43.360]   a more generalized, more fiery, and more scary situation, where it really is anti something
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:49.120]   genocidal on both sides, by the way, I think what we're describing here is a classic vicious cycle,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:56.240]   where you start with there's conditions of occupation that breeds resistance, that breeds
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:03.760]   extremism. Extremism breeds fear on the part of Israelis because they get attacked. And then that
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:09.600]   breeds harsher security conditions, the next level of occupation or blockade, and then the cycle
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:15.840]   continues. Yeah. And so the question is how you break that cycle, because the Israelis right now,
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.160]   and I'm sure Netanyahu would make this point, if we open things up, if we gave you a Palestinian
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:28.000]   state, what's to stop 30,000 Hamas fighters, if we opened up the walls around Gaza, what's to stop
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.680]   30,000 Hamas fighters from massacring us in our homes? And if you do a ground invasion,
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:39.600]   are you inspiring more radicalization? Of course, of course, because for every,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.160]   and so for every person you kill, they've got brothers, they've got sisters, they've got
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.400]   parents, they've got kids, they've got aunts and uncles, and they become the next generation
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.680]   of extremists. How does the cycle break, I think is the frustrating part here. And just
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.960]   looking at the reaction in the US, we saw a lot of discussion over
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:10.320]   young students writing arguments that Israel had brought this on themselves and were solely
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:19.200]   responsible for the Hamas attack. And this has led to massive outrage amongst donors to Ivy League
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:27.360]   schools like Penn and Harvard. And obviously, those have very large endowments. And this is now
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:35.440]   leading to many of them pulling out of commitments they've made. The Wexner Foundation,
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:40.640]   founded by Victoria Secrets billionaire said it's breaking off ties with Harvard.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:47.280]   Idan Ufer quit the executive board of Harvard's Kennedy School. Citadel's Ken Griffin,
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.520]   who's donated more than a half a billion dollars to Harvard placed a call week last week to the
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.720]   head of Harvard and asked the university to come out in support of Israel. And then more than a
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.440]   dozen anonymous donors told the New York Times they felt they had a right and an obligation to
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:07.360]   weigh in here. And before this all happened at Penn donors had started pulling out because of a
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:12.560]   Palestinian rights festival that happened two weeks before the events of 10 seven.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.280]   From September 22 to 24. The U Pen hosted the Palestine rights literature festival,
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.480]   the festival was billed as a gathering to explore the richness and diversity of Palestinian culture.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.160]   But according to multiple sources, it mostly focused on Jews, Israel and Zionism.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   One speaker called for ethnic cleansing of Jews. Another said violence was a necessity. Any
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.720]   thoughts Chamath we were talking last week about these work madrasas. And then I guess this is the
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.640]   second order and third order effects coming into play. If you said it more generically,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:49.120]   this would be a perfect opportunity for these leading universities to actually provide nuance
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:58.800]   and teach people the history of both sides and to show the perspective of both sides.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.960]   That would take leadership. Yeah, I would take courageous leadership on the part of the people
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.920]   who run the university.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   Let's just be honest. I think these elite universities are essentially asset management
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:16.800]   businesses that have an education, the fake leaf of education wrapped around them. So they're more
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:23.280]   like BlackRock than they are like a school. And so they behave like any for profit asset manager
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.360]   would, which is that I think that as they didn't try to intervene in one way or the other over the
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:37.120]   last 15 or 20 years in actually making sure that they were graduating the best kids. So instead,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:44.160]   what happened is they get hijacked by professors and people who wanted one very specific strain of
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:49.440]   thinking. And I don't think it matters which strain it is. But it betrays what the point of
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.520]   the leading university is supposed to be. And then as a result, the people that graduate from these
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.920]   places are close minded. And what that does is that that screws America. Because you have all
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.400]   of these other places graduating kids with a different mindset who then go and build the
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:11.440]   things that matter. And America just keeps falling back. And we're just slower and we're
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.400]   not intellectually capable of thinking in a way that allows us to see more than just what's right
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:22.160]   in front of us. So I don't know what you want me to say. It's just like, I'm just it's a follow up
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:28.960]   to what we talked about last week. And so I thought it was pertinent. sacks, looking at
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:34.800]   the free speech issue, there was some pushback online. Again, not my position. I'm just putting
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:41.920]   it out here for you to comment on sacks, which is blacklisting young college students who had
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:48.800]   an opinion about Palestine is wrong, and you're trying to cancel people, which response to holding
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:54.560]   people accountable or canceling the students for their positions on the Israeli Palestinian
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.060]   conflict?
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:03.280]   Well, what's happening now is that these campuses that took outrageous positions on this whole
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.840]   issue are now trying to wrap themselves in the cloak of academic freedom as if that's a value
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.840]   they've been respecting. Free speech is not a value they've been respecting free speech is a
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:18.880]   value they've been imposing. And this was revealed by a survey that was just done the fire survey
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:28.080]   that surveyed students on 248 campuses on a range of free speech issues. So it asked them about how
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:34.560]   comfortable do you feel expressing your views on controversial topics? What is the tolerance
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.000]   on campus for liberal speakers or conservative speakers? How acceptable is it to engage in
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.440]   disruptive conduct against the speaker on campus such as shouting them down to prevent them from
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.800]   speaking? What sort of administrative support do different views get on campus? And how open
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:57.040]   is the campus to hearing about different issues? And what they found was that the most elite
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:04.400]   schools ranked the worst, the only elite private school to score above average on free speech was
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:10.480]   University of Chicago, which got a score of about 65 out of 100, which made them ranked number 13.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:19.440]   Overall, the rest of the top schools, the Ivies were abysmal. Brown ranked number 69, Duke ranked
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:29.040]   124, Princeton ranked 187, Stanford ranked 207. This is again, out of a total number of 248.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:38.160]   And Penn, which is where the donors are up in arm, ranked second to last, number 247. They scored
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:44.080]   11 points on the survey. And then Harvard finished 248 out of 248 schools ranked,
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:52.880]   also known as dead last. And get this, the rating in the survey was 0.0. They scored a Blutarski.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:49:01.360]   0.0. Remember Blutarski in Animal House? He scored 0.0. Harvard scored 0.0.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:11.280]   0.0. Yes. So, so look, I think it would be, it would be one thing if these schools said to the
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:16.640]   alumni, we agree with you that some of these speakers were over the top, but this is what
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:22.080]   academic freedom is all about. But they have no standing to say anything like that because they
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:28.400]   have been suppressing views on campus, allowing speakers to be shouted down. They have been
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:34.240]   stifling the presentation of alternative views. So this is clearly these types of speakers,
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   these types of views that I think absolutely crossed the line from, again, what we talked
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:44.880]   about, which is type two support for legitimate support for a Palestinian state into hatred of
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:50.480]   Israel and Jews and denying the right to exist. It absolutely crossed over. In many of these cases,
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.640]   there's an outrageous talk given by, I think, a Cornell professor who was outright praising
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.080]   this massacre. Oh, God, that was disturbing. So look, it is simply not the case. He was excited
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:08.960]   about it. Yes, he was excited about it. Thrilled by it. So look, I think that these alumni have a
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:15.600]   point in saying that you, these elite campuses, have been clearly putting your thumb on the scale
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.520]   in favor of certain views. You've been suppressing certain views. So this must be a view that you
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.840]   either share or endorse or permit, given that the rest of your speech regime is so
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.440]   restrictive and oppressive. So even though I would in a different circumstance support academic
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.720]   freedom, I don't think these colleges have a leg to stand on. All right, we're going to talk about
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:44.560]   some other topics today, because that's what we do on the all in podcast. And so tangentially related
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:51.760]   to the speech issues in the EU officials held a meeting to discuss enforcement of the DSA,
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.640]   or Digital Services Act. For some background here, the EU's Digital Services Act updated the
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:04.080]   EU's electronic commerce directive of 2000, which was inspired by section 230 here in the US common
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:10.880]   carrier laws, where the common carriers be those AOL, Yahoo, Google, Facebook are not responsible
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:16.880]   for what individuals post on their platforms. And so that protection has been critically important,
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:23.440]   not making social media sites or WordPress into editors or having them have to censor
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:29.200]   content on their platform. So the DSA officially went into effect in August of this year,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:35.440]   the main goal was to quote unquote, foster safer online environments, the DSA aims to
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:42.560]   do that via tighter rules around disinformation, illegal content, and transparent advertising,
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.840]   those last two, not controversial, that first one, disinformation is obviously the one that's going
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:53.680]   to be pretty challenging. The DSA has been called a new constitution of the internet in an effort to
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:52:03.280]   shape the future of the online world. Some things the DSA covers enforces VLOPS, a new term very
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.000]   large online platforms disclose how their algorithms work. They must give users the right
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.800]   to opt out of recommendation systems and profiling, they must share key data with researchers and
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.440]   authorities, they must cooperate with crisis response requirements, and they must perform
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:23.440]   external and internal audits, they want to force transparency on how content moderation decisions
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.800]   are made. That seems logical. They want to force transparency on the ways advertising is targeted,
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:36.480]   that also seems reasonable. And then they want ways to flag illegal content, obviously obligations
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:42.320]   around protecting minors. I don't think anybody will debate those, but it forces them to cooperate
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.840]   with specialized trusted flaggers to identify and remove this illegal content. I don't know who those
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.560]   people would be. Freeberg, you had some thoughts.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:58.960]   My thoughts are that the era of the open internet as a decentralized technology platform for the
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:07.200]   benefit of individuals and not to be overseen and run by governments is over. The Digital Services
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:16.480]   Act, I think, is one of the most overreaching threats to any sort of open, transparent,
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:24.320]   democratic opportunity on the internet. The idea of the open internet, the idea of creating a
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:30.480]   network of computers that could share information and make services available to individuals around
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:39.680]   the world, freely, uncensored, and an easy to access way was the reason that the internet has
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:47.120]   transformed society, improved productivity, and provided extraordinary benefits. The Digital
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:54.560]   Services Act is an example of a government seeing that a decentralized technology, the internet
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:00.000]   itself is meant to be a decentralized technology. There's no central servers, they are all part of a
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.280]   network of computers that anyone on the network can access anything else on the network. Blockchain,
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:11.360]   obviously, is the more modern kind of exciting, you know, decentralized technology concept that
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.680]   is meant to avoid the scrutiny, the oversight and the control by central governments or central
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:24.400]   authorities of any sort. And the language in the Digital Services Act, I think, got squeezed through
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.160]   in a way that most of the people that I'm guessing passed this Digital Services Act,
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:32.560]   don't fully comprehend the implications of some of the decisions that they're making.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:38.640]   It can be easily framed as this is good for people. You cannot sell illegal content online,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.840]   you cannot sell illegal goods and services. We're trying to safeguard young people. But
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:50.240]   the protection of minors means that you can no longer do personalized web experiences for anyone
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.960]   under 18, which means you need to know the age of everyone. And now your web experience, if you're a
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:00.080]   kid is not going to be personalized. The overreach gets even worse when they say we can now go in
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:09.840]   and run evaluations of the algorithms and allow open access to your data to third party researchers
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.680]   to get into your systems and look at how you guys are running the services that you're offering on
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.440]   the internet. So not only are you no longer allowed to have an open internet where people
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.840]   can provide whatever services they want to provide. But if you're on the internet, you now
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:27.200]   have to make your service and the inside part of your service available for scrutiny by governments.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.680]   And so you have and researchers who are these researchers sounds like a Stasi type the way
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:38.240]   it's written, it gives this commission as the primary regulator effectively a lot of leeway
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:44.480]   in deciding who what, where and how they can go into companies go into individual servers,
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:50.000]   individual computers, I could run an individual company on my computer at home. And it gives this
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   government the legal right in the EU to go into my computer and pull information out of my computer
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.640]   and scrutinize it and make decisions about what I'm doing, and whether or not I'm compliant
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   with whatever the commission's enforcement standards are of that day. I mean, this is
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:10.240]   about as 1984 as you can get. And it's a real serious threat. I don't think people are recognizing
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.960]   the second and third order effects of what this is going to do over time, to internet services to the
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:20.320]   quality of experience we get on the internet. And to the role that government is now going to play
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.840]   in policing, scrutinizing, and providing restricted access to content and services for each individual
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.600]   that wants to use the internet. But it's important to say if you're a European, it'll just make
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:35.040]   Europe even more of a place you go to vacation and never to live. Yeah. Right. I mean, it's not
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.800]   this. We're not talking about America, right? We're talking about Europe. This is all the changes
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.200]   that are going to happen inside of Google, which is going to affect more than just the EU users,
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:48.720]   because of the requests and the demands of the EU. And so you know, the the services that you are
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.480]   going to get around the world are going to be affected by the CEO compliance regime. And it's
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.440]   going to be dynamic. It's a commission, basically a bunch of individuals that get to decide who what,
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:04.880]   where and how. That's gonna, that's going to create a really scary, scary situation, where a
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.800]   bunch of people who are going to have their own motivations, their own political leanings, their
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:17.200]   own objectives, they're going to be able to leverage their particular role in applying
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:25.600]   We saw Canada do something similar. And Facebook's reaction was, and Facebook's reaction was,
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:30.160]   we're not going to syndicate links. So I don't know, I would go back to another argument you
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:35.360]   make a lot, which is which I agree with, which is the free market will act rationally here. And if
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.080]   Google deprecates a bunch of features and or completely pulls out of Europe,
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:45.440]   that'll be the death knell for these kinds of decisions, because then other governments and
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:50.400]   other people will see the cost of trying to get this kind of control. I think the bigger issue
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:57.360]   in a moment like this is Europe has such a checkered past on these things, which is that they
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:06.400]   somehow try to find this moral high ground. And there is just this overreach. And this quasi
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.880]   central planning that just never works. And so if this is another example of it,
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.360]   I would encourage all for profit companies to make the practical decision.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.880]   Can you imagine Google's decision making here, they've got 1000s of employees in Europe,
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.960]   they make billions of dollars in revenue in the market, it's such a difficult situation to be in,
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.800]   not if what you're saying is true, not if what you're saying is this is the threat of the
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.040]   internet. I think it'll be very easy for Larry and Sergey to say cut it move on.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:38.480]   No, I Europe is too big a market for Google or any other major tech company to exit. There's just no
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.320]   way what they're going to do is comply. There won't be a market. Well, hold on a second. What
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:48.800]   this new DSA rule does is apply penalties to social networks for not censoring what they call
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:53.680]   legal speech, which is whatever speech they say it is. So freebirds, right, there's gonna be some
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.920]   sort of committee and Brussels that basically sends out takedown requests now to all these
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.680]   social networks. Yes, the DSA Commission. Yeah, it's pretty safe mission. So yeah,
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:07.920]   Europe, again, is just too big an area not to serve. And then what could happen is that because
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.640]   it's easier for companies just to have one approach where they can, there is a risk that
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.840]   these same policies get applied in the US. That is what happened with privacy. Remember, Europe went
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:23.680]   first with GDPR. And then regulations came to America. Now, the First Amendment may stand in
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:30.080]   the way here. But there is some risk that tech companies of their own accord decide that it's
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.960]   cheaper and easier to comply with the European regime everywhere than trying to parse their
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.400]   service in different markets. I'm just saying that's a risk. But look, let me frame it in a
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:45.200]   different way in an economic argument. Okay, so Europe is about 25 cents of every dollar of
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:51.520]   revenue that Google generates. Okay. So if you think about that, that's call it 60 odd billion
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:58.320]   dollars a year, plus or minus, okay. So the question is, at what point is the cost of trying
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:06.000]   to get 60 billion so great that you say it's not worth the 60 billion. And my point is that there,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.320]   there is an economic, rational argument here for it, if it costs, for example,
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:18.960]   10 or $20 billion to implement this stuff, that's probably the efficient frontier where when you
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.920]   factor in multiple compression, and you factor in behavior change in Europe, which may actually
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.960]   degrade the 60 billion to 50 or 40, where you just throw your hands up and say, it's just not
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.520]   economically worth it. You've seen these actors make this trade off in Canada, it's not totally
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.480]   unreasonable that they run a model to figure out the cost. Maybe they just take the perspective
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.400]   that whenever this DSA Commission sends us a takedown request, we're just going to do it
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.880]   instantly. Why wouldn't that just become the norm? In fact, I'm pretty sure that's what they'll do.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.720]   The management and most of these companies really at all of them except for Elon,
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.640]   they don't really care. They have the same biases. Yeah, they're, they don't care about
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.040]   they're not founders, they don't care about that free speech. Moreover, they have a lot of the
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.920]   same political biases that these are not supporting. All I'm saying is I think that economic
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.360]   rational actors will do the right thing. I think the most likely outcome is that tech companies
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.880]   will be craven and they'll fold those do whatever these EU commissioners want,
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.400]   which then could be an opportunity for, you know, distributed blockchain. You know,
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:26.560]   sort of like that. Yeah, it's hard to scale them, but the devil's in the details.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.200]   Yeah. Or and you guys feel this every day, like Jason, you know, you're right now in the UAE.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.760]   You can communicate in certain ways through WhatsApp, you can't communicate in other ways
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.400]   through iMessage. There are just rules of usability on products. And they exist all
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.640]   around the world. If you go to India, there's certain apps that are blocked and certain apps
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.960]   that are not. And so maybe that's just what happens where there is just a gradient of user
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.520]   experiences around the world for people and we all deal with it. Yeah. And we don't know exactly
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.720]   how heavy handed they're going to be here. This is by definition, heavy handed. I don't agree with
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:05.360]   it. But hold on. We don't know what this is the problem with how they've done this. This is all
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.680]   being done in a star chamber. We don't have any insight into what kind of content they want to
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:16.000]   take down. If it's obviously abusive content, fine. But if it's, you know, COVID information,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.440]   or misinformation, obviously, there's going to be a problem that we saw here in the United States.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.320]   Just so people know, I can't respond to that. Yeah. And once I get away too much credit,
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.960]   Jay cow, I'm not giving them any credit. I do not want to see this happen. I'm not giving them any
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.120]   credit. I'm just saying we'll see how heavy handed they'll be. You're assuming they're going to be
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.440]   super heavy handed. We'll see. And we'll see what their what their own citizens respond.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.720]   I think the fact that a roomful of commissioners in the you can send takedown requests to social
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:51.120]   media companies is by definition, have the handed. Let me back up what the Twitter file showed. Okay,
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.960]   is that we had 80 FBI agents being the conduit for takedown requests to Twitter and presumably
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.120]   other social networks. Well, no, no, but that was all on the deal on the deal. Exactly. Yes,
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.800]   that was not. And yes, moreover, when they did that in their takedown requests, they would always
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:13.920]   point to well, this tweet violates your terms of service. Okay, what the EU is doing is different.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.920]   They're actually defining the terms of service. They're saying that your terms of service need
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.880]   to do x, y, and z. They're doing it explicitly. This is not on the deal. They're not doing it.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:28.000]   They're not saying what policy needs to be what we say it is. And when we tell you to take
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.240]   something down, you're going to do it. They haven't defined what that is. That's I think
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.320]   the issue is, where is the actual definition of what's going to happen here. And that's why it's
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.760]   hard for us to have a discussion about this is because we don't know what they're talking about
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:45.120]   with this content. That's just a problem. Whatever they say in the future is disinformation needs to
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.600]   be taken down. That's the framework. The fine is going to be up to 6% of global revenue for
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.240]   companies that do not comply. So the EU has also figured out that speeding tickets don't work. And
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:06.640]   they're looking to give pretty heavy penalties. So we'll see. This is a moving target here. We
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.080]   don't have complete information. But yeah, it's not a moving target. We do have complete information.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.920]   This is a censorship regime, Jason, we just don't know what their term for illegal or problematic
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:24.000]   content this year. I don't want I don't want to be pitted as your adversary here. I am not in
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.880]   favor of this. So we're clear. But and I don't think there should be a star chamber where people
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.200]   get to pick what goes up and what goes down there. I think the private companies can do a good enough
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.880]   job there. And there should be freedom of speech. And yeah, you're gonna see some things you don't
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.800]   like, grow up, turn change the time. If you don't like it, basically, as they say, sets a horizontal
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:50.400]   rule, covering all services and all types of illegal content. And disinformation, illegal
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.200]   content could be fine, right? freeberg, like, illegal content, putting up doxing, somebody,
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.360]   child pornography, illegal content, I think we would all be okay with it's the disinformation
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.960]   part, right? I'm not trying to be okay or not. Okay. I'm just saying that, like, you're basically
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.880]   saying that whatever the rules are that they come up with that may be different than somewhere else
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:12.160]   on the internet, they get to then regulate other businesses on the internet. I think the internet
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.800]   should be open. Well, and there are a lot I don't want to have a commission approve what I write in
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.520]   my blog post. I don't want the commission telling me that what I put on Twitter, or put on my
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.960]   website is up to them to decide whether or not it's okay to put up because they think it's illegal,
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:32.880]   because it has what they deem to be misinformation. Right? There are already laws that exist.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.920]   So disinformation, illegal content, two different things, but those laws provide some authority to
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.160]   a commissioner. I mean, that's the problem, right? It's it's right. Look, the problem is in the
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.520]   vagueness of this, the law says that social media companies have to take down illegal content, but
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.800]   it doesn't say what illegal content is, it delegates the power to define it to this group of
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.880]   Eurocrats led by theory Bretton, and they're meeting this week to hammer it out. So yeah,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:04.160]   look, in practice, it's gonna be whatever they say it is. That is explicit censorship.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:12.400]   Okay, let's move on to our final topic. Second largest hype cycle of 2023, perhaps GLP ones.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:17.200]   Chamath you brought this up in our group chat. So maybe you could tee it up.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.600]   Well, I was just interested in understanding
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:27.920]   everything that's been happening around GLP is mostly because it just seems like people
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:33.040]   think it's a panacea. We have a lot of our friends, Jason, you were the one that said this.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:39.760]   In our poker group, like four of the 12 or 13 regulars are on it. Is that right?
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.960]   I think it was four of like, yeah, four of 12 people were on it. Yeah, it was a third. Yeah.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.920]   And then and then I got this really interesting chart, Nick, you may want to put this up. It
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:07:01.040]   basically showed how the GLP one market was tracking very similar to the AI market in terms
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:08.640]   of a hype, which is if you separated companies as a basket of people who were positively affected
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:15.440]   by GLP ones like Lily and Nova Nordisk. And you had a basket of companies that were disrupted by
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:24.160]   GLP ones, those would be like, Dexcom or Davida or folks like that. It eerily mimics the same hype
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.440]   cycle around AI, which is there's those businesses that seem to be feeding the hype train around AI
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:34.400]   and then all of these companies that theoretically will be disrupted. And it just brought up to me
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:40.800]   that there's this incredible market movement here where I think people think that these GLP ones are
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.600]   a solution to everything. And I thought it was just an important thing to discuss because
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.280]   scientifically, the mechanism of action is still a little questionable and murky. On top of that,
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.440]   I think we don't know physiologically what the real long term ramifications of taking these things
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.520]   are. There's still a lot of mixed evidence around the total amount of weight loss you can lose the
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.160]   percentage of muscle versus fat that you lose. And so yeah, I just thought it was important for us to
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.000]   talk about it and see what this would be a
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.840]   basket spread trade. Here are the companies that win here are the companies that loses and look at
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:19.360]   that gap between the two and it's exactly mimics people who would benefit from AI and people will
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:28.320]   lose from AI. Yeah, the GLP one hype. The summary is the GLP one hype cycle is as overextended as
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:34.160]   the AI hype cycle. So we should probably separate the wheat from the chaff and start by understanding
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.040]   what GLP ones are. Because I'm sure there's a lot of people in our listening community who are on
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.720]   this stuff, they should really probably understand that's where you think we should go next. We should
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:52.080]   then throw it to the sultan of science himself, David freeberg explained to us what we prepare
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:09:00.080]   our Uranus jokes, GLP ones. These drugs have been around for a while, they're small peptides,
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:07.920]   little proteins that bind to this GLP receptor in your gut, that causes insulin to be released from
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:15.120]   your pancreas and triggers a couple of other hormones that reduce your hunger and appetite.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.120]   So basically gets you to eat less and your brain and your brain and it's effectively a way to make
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.760]   you feel not hungry. And you're not you're you can then run a calorie deficit. And when you run a
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:32.480]   calorie deficit, your body starts starving and starts burning other parts of your body besides
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.440]   the glucose that can get out of the stomach where you would otherwise have food and ends up in your
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.280]   blood. And it starts generating energy from your stored body fat and your stored and your muscle
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:49.680]   mass. So these have been around for a while. Novo Nordisk is the developer of two of the
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:56.640]   main drugs. And here's a chart of Novo Nordisk stock price, you can see that in the last
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:03.040]   five years, their stock has five x, they've basically gone from, you know, call it a
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:10.080]   $60 billion company to a $350 billion company in five years, largely on the back of the promise
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.280]   of this drug. So these drugs have been around for a while. And there's actually one that's
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.400]   been on the market for a long time, but it only causes 5% body mass loss. So 5% weight loss. So
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.080]   people are like, Oh, it's not that great, it didn't really get widely adopted. Then this new class,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.960]   they add a little side chain, add another little molecule to the peptide. And as a result, it
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.880]   didn't get degraded as fast. And it was far more bioactive in the body and caused a much
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.120]   greater benefit. And so suddenly, people on these drugs started to see massive weight loss,
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.440]   massive improvement, diabetes, and metabolic health all moves together. So as you burn body
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.880]   fat, as you have less glucose in your blood, your your metabolic condition improves. The problem is
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:50.160]   when you're starving normally, if you were to just stop eating, you would typically see that your
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.640]   body starts burning first of all the glucose and then it burns off the glycogen in your muscles,
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.000]   which is the next energy store. Once that's gone, your body starts burning fat. And as it's burning
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.640]   more fat, it also says, Hey, I need to get these other molecules, which I'm not getting just from
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.360]   the fat, I need muscle, and your body actually starts burning muscle. And that's how your brain
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.840]   gets energy that it needs when you're starving is actually primarily from the degradation of
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:21.200]   muscle tissue. So normally, if you're just starving yourself, you'll see a ratio of weight loss,
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:26.800]   where it's about 20% coming from lean muscle mass. In some of the studies that have been done on
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:33.120]   these GLP one agonists, we're seeing up to 40% of the weight loss coming from lean muscle mass
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.480]   being burnt off. So Jason, I don't know if you've done a DEXA scan, because I think you've you've
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.600]   said publicly that you've tried it, right? I mean, yeah, you should check you should check
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.880]   out what your lean muscle mass is versus your fat composition and your body. I don't know if you
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.320]   have it from before. But I have him. And this has been one of the concerns, obviously, if you're not
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.480]   working out, and you're not, you know, doing what you need to to eat protein and build muscle,
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.960]   you're going to be burning through a lot of that muscle mass. And so that's problem number one,
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.280]   that's arisen that people are concerned about. The other one that's that's really, I don't know
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.760]   if it's concerning or not. But when people go off these drugs, they gain the weight back in a very
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.600]   quick way. And there's two reasons for this one is, if you haven't actually changed your behavior,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.880]   you haven't changed your exercise patterns. And you suddenly have the appetite suppressing drug
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.840]   taken out of your system, you start eating more food again. And when you've been in a state of
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.920]   starvation, your meta, your metabolism, your baseline metabolism goes down. So instead of
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.160]   burning on average 2000 calories a day, your body's only burning at 1200 calories a day.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.000]   So suddenly, if you go back to eating 2000 calories a day, because you're not you're,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.280]   you know, you no longer have the appetite suppressor, you're gonna have a cow,
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.480]   you're gonna reinflate. And so so your metabolism goes down, the appetite suppressant goes away,
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.120]   and you gain all the weight back if you haven't changed your behavior otherwise. And so I don't
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.960]   know if you guys saw this clip I sent out of Arnold Schwarzenegger talking with Howard Stern.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   But he was talking about how like, I can't do a Howard accent, J. Cal, you could probably do it
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.320]   really well. But you know, one thing you what do you think of the Ozempic? But you know,
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:12.160]   how the Ozempic is, you know, Americans used to be very interested in working hard. And I don't
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:17.040]   know why that's so bad. But you get up at 5am and you work hard, and you do it and you make yourself
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.600]   strong. Right? That's what it's about. You don't need to do a little baby girl Ozempic in your
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:27.840]   sight. Oh, look, I'm gonna eat less food. Thank you. Wait, did you listen to the clip? Is that
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.360]   is that what he said? That's exactly what he said. That's exactly what he said. You don't exactly
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:42.560]   really man. I don't make it this way. What do you mean? Hard work. And that's why I say in my book,
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:49.040]   you know, work, work your ass off. And because it's there's no shortcut. What built this country?
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   Too much. Is it people that were whipping out? This is how I want to be comfortable. No,
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:03.120]   this will balls, you women and men that went out there at five in the morning and got up and they
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   struggled and they fought and they worked their butts off. That's what made this country great.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:15.200]   He said that in response to I think Howard Stern's questions about Ozempic. Yeah, like,
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.480]   but don't take a shot. Like, like, we're basically creating a new multi billion dollar
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.760]   pharmaceutical drug system that people are going to have to stay on in order to stay healthy.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.720]   Do we know what the long term effects of taking some of gluotide are and can be and will be?
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:35.280]   Do we know these drugs have been around for quite a long time? So you know, the
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.200]   there are various side effects, but in terms of like, are we debilitating our health over the long
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:47.360]   run? You know, it seems to be a reasonably safe drug. And it seems to be a drug that that folks
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.720]   are kind of recognizing as being well worth the cost and whatever the risks may be.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:59.200]   Well, what are the implications that if you lose 40%? Well, it's about 16% of your weight loss,
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.320]   you typically lose, right? I mean, yeah, they'll say up to 20%. If you lose weight, you'll usually
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.680]   see up to 20% of lean muscle mass of the of the weight you lost coming from lean muscle mass loss.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:16.240]   And, you know, 80% or 85%, as you say, come off coming from from body fat loss. But with the
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.400]   ozempic drugs, they're seeing as high as 40% coming from lean muscle mass, which is obviously
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.280]   concerning. I just made an adjustment. I everybody knows I lost like 40 pounds or so or talk to me for
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:30.960]   more than five minutes, you know, I have because I'll tell you and the first 20 was just fasting
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.640]   and doing keto. And then when this drug came out, I tried it, I tried to send pick and then I did
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.080]   what Govi and I'm going to give you but I didn't gain it back. I gained back about four or five
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.960]   pounds. And I also increased protein in the morning. And I do a lot of walking. Okay, so
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:50.000]   so let me give you this math and tell me if it maps to what you have felt or not. So if 250 pounds,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.040]   let's just say you lose 16% of your body weight, that's 40 pounds. Okay, so you get to 190. I was
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:04.080]   right to 210. And of that, you lose 16 pounds of muscle. Is that what you saw? Or did you see
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.280]   something less than that? No much less muscle because I use weights and I do a lot of walking
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.120]   and I eat a ton of protein, right? So you're doing the exercise, you're doing the exercise,
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.920]   I'm not doing hardcore exercise. It's a no, I do exercise, you have to do exercise. And the
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.680]   challenge J kal is that the vast majority of people that go on the drugs, by the way, I'm
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.000]   not saying the drugs shouldn't be adopted. I think that there's extraordinary benefit health benefit
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.680]   to the majority of people that are on these drugs. But the downside is that if you're not exercising,
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.040]   you are going to lose muscle mass. And then obviously, there is the fact that you're now
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.480]   hooked on this thing, if you're not going to figure out ways to change behavior,
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   I cycled off of that two or three times and had very minor weight gain back three, four or five
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:50.240]   pounds, but I deliberately changed my relationship with food portion size. And I work out now. And
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.400]   what I found was as I lost weight, my interest and the joy I got out of working out dramatically
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:03.680]   increased. So running, walking, skiing, everything got easier, and I just got more into it. So I like
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:11.040]   working out again, now that I'm 40, hot pound 42 pounds off my peak weight. So I think it's an
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.640]   amazing wonder drive. I'm having a great experience on this, like a take on this,
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.200]   like you think that these things are overhyped right now. And we're just in the middle of a
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.720]   hype cycle, or what's your key takeaway? My key takeaway is that for many people,
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:27.120]   from a health perspective, I think that it could be a really great solution.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.480]   I think that these triple agonists that are coming out are going to be probably even more
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:39.040]   effective than these double agonists that we have right now. Yeah. I don't understand the triple
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:44.560]   when Jaro's the triple agonist. Yeah. People who don't jarrow told me it is
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:51.840]   unbelievable how not hungry you are. Yeah, it's super fast to super fast. I just want to see,
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.440]   you know, like, for example, when you know, when you get older in your 60s and 70s,
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.480]   one of the biggest risks you take on and in your 80s is actually like, you know, musculoskeletal
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.080]   and falls and things like that. And one of the best preventative measures for that is muscle
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.760]   mass. And so you get into this weird catch 22 of your place one issue with another. So longitudinally,
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.160]   if you use it for a long time, I'm concerned about that. I do think that these GLP ones,
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:22.640]   if when we look back on it will probably be like statins. And in as much as when statins first came
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:29.680]   on the market, it was a wonder drug, right. And, you know, we were all teetering towards,
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.520]   you know, heart disease and heart attacks and all of this stuff. And then once people got on
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.960]   these statins, I think there was a very meaningful impact to the percentage of people that that
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.360]   suffered heart disease and cardiac issues, but heart disease still continues to grow.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.600]   And you would say to yourself, well, how is this possible? Because statins are effectively free,
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.200]   they're generic, they're widely available. And today, right now, because of the lack of supply,
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:58.000]   the emergency FDA order around the semi glutoids allows you to make generics right now,
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.800]   right. So the cost of those are not really 1000 bucks a month, but can be as cheap as a few 100.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:08.320]   So you're getting this widespread adoption and usage. I think the open question for me is,
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:14.400]   if human history is a guide, we're going to replace this issue with a different kind of issue.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:20.880]   Because unfortunately, you know, maybe people take it and then they physiologically adapt,
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.560]   and then they just continue to eat the same or more, because they think, wow, this is a get out
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:30.640]   of jail free card for me. And maybe they overpower that satiety that that's sent that glp one is
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:37.200]   supposed to give you I don't know. I find it from a sort of public societal health perspective,
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:43.440]   really interesting. From an economic market perspective. I think that these things are
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.560]   priced to perfection. It's kind of like Nvidia, which is like, right? If people are assuming
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.280]   everything people are assuming everything is going to work. It's a tough point in the cycle
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:58.800]   to be a buyer, I think as an economic actor. But as you're making a trade, that seems like a hard
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:05.520]   trade to make. And just to give even some more color to it. Novo Nordisk announced that it was
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.560]   halting. So Zimba kidney disease trial early. Well, Nick show that because it was so conclusive.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:17.440]   Yeah, I mean, if you look at that, it's marked a $3.6 billion sell off in shares of dialysis
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.000]   providers. I mean, remember, over 40% of Americans are clinically obese. It's a
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.560]   sorry, almost 60%. Now it's an extraordinary health epidemic in the United States. And you know,
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:31.120]   if this drug can have this sort of an effect, it can reduce costs across the healthcare system. So
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.640]   you know, there is still a I mean, Chumash point out that is the right number.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:40.880]   This affects cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease,
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.880]   there's an average 16% weight loss reduction actually get people from obesity to
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.600]   on obesity, or are they still are they still obese?
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:56.640]   The obesity trial seem to remember you have to get FDA approval for a particular
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.600]   so this is this is what Jason was mentioning. So this is this is a basket that Morgan Stanley
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:07.600]   created, which was essentially starting at the beginning of the year when the hype was really
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.720]   starting to get out of control. Morgan Stanley created a basket of the GLP one winners and a
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.520]   basket of the G GLP one potentially disrupted healthcare stocks. So you could trade them off
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.400]   against each other. And this just shows how it's performed, which is just a blockbuster trade in
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:28.320]   the last 10 months. So if you if you went long the GLP one winners and short these potential
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.720]   potentially disrupted, it's I mean, I've never seen a spread trade pay off like this in such a
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:39.120]   short time at 80% a year, unless unbelievable nature of would you take the other side of this
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.520]   trade right now? Or like, how do you I would, I would I would take the reason. And the reason is
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:50.640]   because of two, two, two practical factors. One is that when when a when a market gets this
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   exaggerated, what you're pricing in is essentially like a panacea solution that and those tend to not
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:01.280]   really be realistic. And again, I would point to statins as a good example of that. And so there's
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:07.280]   a part of it, which is just like, these trades are so overextended, that you can probably pretty be
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.680]   pretty safe on the other side. And then the second part is that I don't think we really understand
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:19.280]   yet. The other half of the coin, which is, you know, for every one of us that's generally positively
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:25.120]   inclined around GLP ones, who isn't getting enough attention right now, are the doctors who've
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.080]   spending a lot of time researching, researching this stuff, who may actually have a perspective
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:36.000]   on the other side, you know, probably the most prominent one like Bob Lustig. So you have to
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.120]   give that a little bit of time for it to play out, because nobody wants to hear the bear case on GLP
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:48.080]   ones as a drug that people take. So I would just say that it's it's probably again, when you see it,
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:53.280]   an economic trade like this, it's it's, it's probably okay to be on the other side of it.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:59.040]   And then just from a public health perspective, you know, take a wait and see. But for a lot of
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.800]   people who are clinically obese, it doesn't seem like the math is such that if you're at a BMI of
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.480]   30, reducing your weight 16% I think gets you to like a 26 it doesn't get you under I think it's
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.360]   meaningful. I think it's meaningful. No, no, I'm not saying it's not meaningful. I'm saying it
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:19.680]   does it. You're still obese. Yeah, I think the the key thing and I don't want to give medical advice,
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.760]   but I think you need to do this holistically. So you got to keep your diet and you got to keep
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.360]   working out in mind when you do it. And that should be fairly obvious. And those are always
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.920]   good things to do is to make sure you take it your whole life and not work out or how do you
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:36.000]   view? No, I'm five pounds from my lowest weight as an adult and my the weight I used to be when
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.600]   I ran marathons. And so my plan is to come off of it. Like by the end of this year, and then
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:47.840]   and I had taken like six months off twice doing this. So I did it like a little intentional
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:53.280]   his friends in spurts friends. Yeah, just to get where I wanted to be. And this last five,
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:00.400]   last five pounds. What is your Do you have a sense of if your behavior changes?
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:09.840]   When you're on and you're off? Like, do you? Yeah, I do feel more hungry. But then I remember how
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:16.240]   bad I felt when I was overweight. And I just weigh myself every day. And if I see myself
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:21.280]   get above a certain number, I consider that like a red alert. And I just, you know, either start
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.080]   fasting, working out or just eating super healthy. So it's just the discipline of weighing myself
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.280]   every day that I've gotten into. And just understanding, hey, you know, if I make two or
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.440]   three bad decisions, you're not going to make two or three bad decisions when you're on these drugs,
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.840]   in my experience, because you feel so bloated and so painful when you overeat, that you don't want
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.320]   to do it. It's really it's really like it hurts. You feel distended. And you know, there are
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.440]   reports and it did happen to me twice over two or three years of doing this, that if you take it and
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.640]   you eat too much, you you could get sick and actually vomit. So it some people just don't
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.320]   have the stomach for it. I think a lot of people just tap out it makes their stomachs feel too
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.840]   distended or gnarly. And that and that's why the dosage actually really matters. They have
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:10.240]   dosages that are like a very wide range, maybe 10 x. And so the dosage getting that right working
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.880]   with your doctor is key. But yeah, I'm just I'm excited to get off it because I want to really
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.040]   start sincerely weightlifting. So I'm getting a personal trainer to do like weightlifting twice a
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:25.040]   week and get really into that next. Because you can't do hardcore intense working out with us
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:31.520]   because you're, you know, just lower calorie. But I think it's a miracle drug. And I'm excited about
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.520]   the one question I have for you on the spread trade. Before we end, Chamath, does the nature
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:41.040]   of making those indexes and giving people the ability to put the trade on exacerbate the trade
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.120]   because then I saw everybody was tweeting about this, you know, over the last week, does the
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   nature of an index being made impact the the the box, you know, Morgan Stanley is particularly good
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.760]   at these basket creations, and they tend to make it for their biggest hedge fund clients and their
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.200]   richest families. So it tends to be pretty isolated. They, they they give an edge to a
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:09.760]   few folks that so these things are not broadly published. And so I doubt it in the end,
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.600]   but so they come up with this idea, how many in how many names are in each index,
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.080]   it all just depends like and they're very smart about, you know, being able to create these on
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.880]   the fly based on what themes they're seeing. And then, like I said, they share them with their
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:26.240]   best hedge fund clients and their and their and their biggest families. They don't they don't
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.240]   trade, you know, they don't share them with us. I got it, Jason, when I told you like,
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.640]   at the end of all of that at the end of that graph, everybody put the trade on and got the win.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:41.200]   But so they didn't actually share it with me in January. I wish they did.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:46.240]   All right, listen, we got to wrap up great show boys. And we're praying for peace and
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.840]   the return of the hostages for the Sultan of science, the dictator and the rain man. Yeah,
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.200]   David Sachs, I am the world's greatest moderator. See you at episode 151. Enjoy the 150
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.480]   fan meetups this weekend. Anybody who's going to love your voice.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.480]   Let your winners ride.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.360]   Rain Man David Sachs.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:14.160]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:24.480]   Besties are gone.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.480]   That's my dog taking a notice your driveway.
