[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   [music]
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.960]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.320]   This episode was jointly hosted by the Indiana Bogleheads
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.040]   and the Starting Out Life Stage Chapter and recorded May 3, 2021.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.840]   It features Paul Merriman and Chris Pettersen
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.320]   from the Merriman Financial Education Foundation.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.640]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.480]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.680]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.000]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.480]   First of all, what is a Boglehead?
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.520]   Boglehead is a term intended to honor Vanguard founder
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.280]   and investor advocate John Bogle.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.240]   Bogleheads are investing enthusiasts who participate in the Bogleheads Forum.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.160]   The Forum's members discuss financial news and theory
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.840]   while also helping less experienced investors develop their portfolios.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.280]   Bogleheads also follow 10 rules of investing.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.560]   Which are develop a workable plan, invest early and often,
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.200]   never bear too much risk or too little risk,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   diversify, never try to time the market,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.120]   use index funds when possible,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.200]   keep costs low, minimize taxes,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.840]   invest with simplicity, and stay the course.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.520]   There are more than 100,000 registered members
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.920]   and the site receives an average of nearly 2,000 posts each day.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120]   Some members also participate in national and local chapter get-togethers.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.600]   The Bogleheads community encompasses the Forum,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.720]   the Wiki,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.680]   free investment books which include
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.520]   the Bogleheads Guide to Investing,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.680]   the Bogleheads Guide to Retirement Planning,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.080]   and the Bogleheads Guide to a Free Funding Employer.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   Affiliated sites include a presence on Facebook Employer,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.120]   the John C. Bogle Foundation for Financial Literacy,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.800]   a series of podcasts, and a blog.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.920]   And just a little bit of information about the new idea that Bill Cox started
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240]   about the Starting Life Strategies Chapter,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.120]   or other Life Strategies Chapters.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.800]   The new Life Stage Chapters are geared toward personal finance issues
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.600]   and topics particularly relevant to a specific stage in our investing life
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.560]   and are designed to complement the already existing geographical-based Bogleheads Chapters.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.080]   The Starting Out Life Stage mission is to provide education and discuss on investing
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.200]   and personal finance topics geared towards novice investors of any age
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.480]   and young investors just getting started out with their finances and careers.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.440]   Topics will include basics of investing in personal finance,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.240]   Bogleheads investing in Jack Bogle,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.280]   asset allocation, assessing your risk tolerance, risk and return,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.920]   cost matter, the impact of cost over time, creating and managing your portfolio,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.960]   selecting funds, and staying the course, budgeting and managing your money,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.800]   and insurance, long-term investing versus market timing and stock picking,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.000]   and common new investor issues we will cover.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.880]   Why do I have to save money for retirement when I'm only in my 20s?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.320]   What? Me? Worry? I'm 100% stocks and can handle any downturn.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.400]   What do I do with this 401k list of funds so I can get on with my life?
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.800]   I'm following my passion, but the salary is low and there's no 401k or health insurance.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.520]   If I knew what I know now, advise from senior Bogleheads.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.320]   Investing is a lifestyle. It's more than just putting money in accounts.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.600]   It's how you live your life.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.280]   And now on to our special speaker, Paul Merriman.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.520]   Paul Merriman is a nationally recognized authority on mutual funds,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.000]   index investing, asset allocation, and both buy and hold and active management strategies.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.080]   Now retired from Merriman, the Seattle-based investment advisory firm he founded in 1983
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.600]   is dedicated in educating investors, young and old,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.160]   through weekly articles at marketwatch.com, as well as via free e-books, podcasts,
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.560]   articles, and more at his website, paulmerriman.com.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.760]   In 2013, he created the Merriman Financial Education Foundation,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.120]   dedicating to providing comprehensive financial education to investors.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   The foundation provides information and tools for investors to make informed decisions
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.840]   on their own best interest and successfully implement the retirement savings program.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.600]   A major project of the foundation is funding the curriculum, development, and teaching of
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.000]   the four-credit course personal investing for non-finance majors at Paul's alma mater,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.240]   Western Washington University, which began in the fall of 2013.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.920]   In his retirement, Paul remains fervently committed to educating and empowering investors.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   In 2012, he wrote and published the How to Invest series,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.720]   distilling his decades of expertise into concise investment books,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.200]   targeting to specific audiences.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.360]   And some of those books would include First Time Investor,
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.280]   Grow and Protect Your Money, 101 Investment Decisions Guaranteed to Change Your Financial
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.080]   Future, and Get Smart or Get Screwed, How to Select the Best and Get the Most from Your
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.120]   Financial Advisor.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.680]   Paul also has an informative investing podcast called Sound Investing, which is available on
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.880]   any of your many options as far as streaming apps, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.480]   Google Podcasts, et cetera.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   And now on to Paul Merriman.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.240]   Thank you, John, very much.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.760]   And thanks to all of you for coming out this evening.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.400]   It is special to me.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.760]   I am a great fan of the Boglehead's work.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.360]   The reality is that over the years, I've taken some hits there.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:22.560]   And I've also, I think, made a number of friends who have taken advantage of some of the work
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.400]   that we have done.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.000]   And the reason I've taken hits is because I'm one of those outliers.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.400]   I love buy and hold.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.560]   I love index funds.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.520]   I also have half of my own retirement portfolio professionally managed with market timing.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.400]   So I'm kind of an odd duck in this industry.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:54.240]   But the one thing I'm committed to is helping every do-it-yourself investor do it better.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.840]   One of my favorite websites is called the White Coat Investor.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.200]   I suspect many of you subscribe and read Jim Dahl's work.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:14.000]   But he has an article there entitled "150 Portfolios Better Than Yours."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.320]   And what it is, it's now grown to over 200, but he hasn't changed the title.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   And they are 200 different portfolios that would legitimately probably work fine in a
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.320]   normal kind of market over a normal 40-year period or whatever period you've got left
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.840]   to do your investing.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:45.920]   There is no shortage of fine portfolios developed to meet the needs of the individual.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.640]   My goal is just a little different.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.040]   I am trying to fine tune every step we take along the way.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.200]   And this presentation tonight is going to include some of those steps.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.480]   Hang on just one sec.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:11.120]   Just a sec.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.680]   There we go.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.120]   So here's what I believe.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.440]   I believe what Warren Buffett says when he says you only have to do a very few things
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.040]   right in your life as long as you don't do too many things wrong.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.680]   And he was talking not just about investing.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.000]   He was talking about success.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.080]   And I do believe that, that in most challenges we have in life, there are some simple steps
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.600]   that we can take to solve the problems.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.640]   I have been on a diet since the fifth grade.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.440]   I have lost over 4,000 pounds.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:58.240]   I absolutely know how simple dieting is, how easy it is to lose weight.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:07.280]   The challenge is, for many of us, is that when it comes to food, sex, and money, these
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.080]   are not intellectual pursuits.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.640]   These are emotional pursuits.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.880]   So the problems are not just to figure out the right things to do, because the right
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:25.600]   things to do with diet could fit on two sides of a three-by-five card instead of a, what,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.080]   a $40 billion industry.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.800]   And my goal is to try to find-- and by the way, we're going to have some information
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:42.560]   coming this evening from Chris Pedersen-- but I'm trying to find simple ways for people
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.360]   to achieve the best return they can within their risk tolerance.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.600]   And what I know about what Chris is going to show you tonight, it is one of the cleverest
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.840]   strategies I have seen.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:03.120]   And if I had to look at the 200 portfolios better than yours, I would have Chris's two
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.480]   Funds for Life portfolio right up there.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:18.320]   In the book, we're talking millions, there are 12 different decisions or forks in the
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.800]   road.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.120]   And the interesting thing is, they are all very, very simple.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:32.400]   When I say they're easy to do, for some people, they're not easy because of the emotional
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.800]   implications of doing what they ask you to do.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.160]   But they certainly are simple, even if they aren't always easy.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.360]   And they're all time tested.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.640]   I will show you evidence.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.680]   We don't have proof for the future, but we have a lot of evidence from the past going
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.720]   back over 90 years tonight.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:03.760]   And I want that evidence to challenge maybe your thinking about how to construct a portfolio
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.560]   to give you the best unit of return per unit of risk.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.880]   So that's going to be fun for me.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.120]   I certainly hope it's helpful to you.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.520]   But here's the bottom line.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.880]   There is some reason why this book is being well received.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:29.040]   Because except for talking about the two funds for life that Chris developed, the other things
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.280]   that I recommend are pretty much standard recommendations in the industry.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:42.480]   So what is it that book does that seems to catch the imagination of investors?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.920]   Because we've had phenomenal reviews on our book at Amazon.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.160]   And I think this is it.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:59.840]   My point is, and I think it's huge, is for every half a percent that you can make additional
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.000]   return over a lifetime.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.240]   And I'm talking about particular for younger investors, because they have all that time
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.360]   ahead of them.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   But for every half a percent, and this includes getting to retirement and then taking money
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.880]   out.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.680]   So that's part of the reward for all that investment, taking it out.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:28.480]   How much you take out and how much the other reward is, you leave to others.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.680]   So you total up how much you take out and how much you leave to others.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:43.280]   And that is the, in essence, that is the outcome of all of your investing and spending and
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:43.760]   leaving.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:51.360]   And I contend that every half a percent more that you make compounded, of course, will
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.320]   lead to likely over a million dollars.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.560]   Let me just show you how that works.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.960]   Let's talk about a young person who's got many years ahead of them.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:10.320]   Let's say that they put away $6,000 a year for 40 years, $240,000.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.880]   Let's say that they are able to achieve an 8% compound rate of return.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.400]   Now, there's a reason why I use this number.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:27.520]   And that is when I look at Chris Pedersen's research, and you look back at the likely
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:36.080]   return of a target date fund, a fund that I think is probably one of the greatest inventions
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   in the history of investing.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.240]   8% compound rate of return is a very fine long-term return.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.280]   Not if you were in equities all your life, maybe.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.800]   But remember, a target date fund, it starts mostly with all equities, and then it starts
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.720]   adding bonds to the portfolio.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.840]   So we don't expect over a 40-year period to necessarily get an all-equity return.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.760]   But if you got 8% during the accumulation period, and then you worked, you took the
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.120]   money that you retired with, and you live for, I believe, another 30 years, and you
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.760]   make 6% on that money, and you take 4% out.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.360]   Those are the assumptions.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.040]   So what do we know?
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:30.640]   We know that if you made an 8% compound rate of return, at retirement, you'd have $1.7
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.040]   million.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.120]   That's great.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.480]   That's with the $6,000 commitment.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.040]   And many of you, obviously, are putting away a lot more than $6,000 a year, particularly
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.560]   if we're talking about a couple.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:53.440]   What I do know is that if I could figure out any way to make an extra half a percent, make
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.200]   8.5% instead of 8%, I would have not $1.7 million.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.400]   I'd have $1.9 million.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:11.200]   So that is the first kind of major step towards that extra million, million and a half dollars
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.480]   for that half a percent.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.320]   But then the important part happens.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.800]   And that is, you start taking money out.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.840]   And you're taking money out at 4% a year.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.160]   And you live until age 95.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:32.480]   And that means that at age 95, taking out the 4% a year, you'd have left for your heirs
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.000]   $2.8 million.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.240]   Now, if you were able during that distribution period to make an extra half a percent, instead
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.000]   of $2.8 million, you would end retirement with $3.7 million.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.880]   It's adding up.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.760]   But then there's what you leave to others.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.800]   That counts too.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.520]   People have often asked me, how have you done with your investments?
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.000]   And my answer is, well, I've done OK.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.840]   But the fact is, I shouldn't be judged until I die.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:15.200]   Because it is only at my death that we really know the total impact of all the investing,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.040]   saving, and distributions, et cetera, whether to myself or to family or charities.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.240]   That all needs to be put into the hopper to make the determination.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.640]   How did that investor do?
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.400]   So what do we know?
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:36.320]   We know that at the 6%, you would have withdrawals of $2.6 million.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.400]   At the 6.5%, you'd have withdrawals of $3.2 million.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:50.080]   And when you add up the amount of the withdrawals and the amount of what you leave to others,
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.960]   that difference at the end of this two parts of your life, the accumulation and the distribution,
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.760]   is the difference between about $7 million and about $5.5 million or about $1.5 million.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:12.560]   If we can find a half a percent, and you all know so easily,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.320]   bogleheads know how to pick up an extra half of 1%.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.000]   So as I go through some of these ways to do this,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.960]   you're going to say, yeah, I know that, and I know that, and I know that.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.240]   Yes, you do know that.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   But the fact is, those little things you already know
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.000]   are those things that are going to be able to add extra returns.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.440]   I'm going to add a couple things to the pile tonight of things for you to consider.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.120]   Save versus spend.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.160]   Huge decision.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.040]   I don't have to tell you that.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.920]   You know that.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.160]   But bogleheads are oftentimes folks who help others.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:18:00.640]   And the reality is that we know that you get nowhere with investing unless you do some saving.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.920]   And I think Warren Buffett has one of the best quotes on saving, and that is,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.960]   "Do not save what is left over after spending, but spend what is left over after saving."
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:19.120]   This is the beauty of a 401(k) plan that automatically starts taking money out of your
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.000]   income when you start working.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.600]   You have to opt out of that plan, and industry is finding that tends to work.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.280]   And by the way, that's how pensions work.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:39.600]   Pensions could pay you that money as you worked for that company, and they could tell you,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:45.200]   now we want you to manage this money because we want to make sure that you're taken care of
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:52.400]   and in retirement, whether you take a pension or you convert it to an IRA and take the money
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:19:00.800]   out of that, whichever way you do it, we want you to have enough money to retire the way you wish.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:08.320]   Now, beautifully, wonderfully, they didn't let people put their fingers on the money
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.840]   because we know what happens.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.280]   Most people who get their hands on the money blow it.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.320]   Most people do not do the right things with the money.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.720]   And I'm going to give you just a couple of numbers.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.800]   I don't want to interfere with what Chris is going to tell you about tonight,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.120]   but I do want to tell you there is evidence that most people blow it.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.760]   But the trustees of a pension, see, they didn't let people do that.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.320]   Now things have changed.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.760]   We have the equivalent of a pension, theoretically, if you choose to, if you don't opt out,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.920]   and you have to build it yourself.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.680]   And that's why it's so important that people do the right thing.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.120]   And the earlier they do it, the earlier they do it, the better they are.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.760]   I talked earlier about the idea that I want to focus not on just people who are starting in
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.720]   their 20s.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.600]   I want to start from the day a child is born.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   I want to do things as a parent and a grandparent.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.840]   And I've done this both as a parent and a grandparent, done things to get them started.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.400]   I'm not talking about spoiling them, but to get them started at a young age.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.680]   So, for example, put away a dollar a day from birth to 65.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.360]   Keep it in the S&P 500 or the total market index.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:34.720]   By the way, I think most of you know the S&P 500 and the total market index have historically
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.200]   had almost the same return.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.080]   And so either way, you're going to get about the same return with the total market index
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:48.000]   or the S&P 500 because they are both cap-weighted portfolios.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.560]   And the biggest 50 companies in both indexes are driving almost all of that return.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.560]   So 10% for 65 years turns into almost 1.8 million.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:06.480]   You wait until a child is 10, and it turns into 686,000.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:12.240]   Or if you wait until a child is 21 and put away a dollar a day until they're 65.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.040]   By the way, I'm not expecting you to put it away.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.120]   They need to learn to put it away.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.680]   But it's 238,000.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.320]   This is the phenomenal impact of starting early.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.520]   And to the extent that we are, I'll call it thoughtful parents, thoughtful grandparents.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.680]   We want to do it in a way that we don't ruin people's lives.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:42.240]   But wouldn't it be wonderful 40, 50 years, 60 years from now that a child or a grandchild
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.480]   didn't have to fight some of the fights I suspect people are going to have to fight
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.880]   50 and 60 years from now in terms of survival.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.000]   All right.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Another way to look at that, and you probably know this old story about two people.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.440]   I happen to use the names Jim and Nadine because they were two of the first clients I had as
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.880]   an investment advisor.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   And the assumption is they both put away $5,000 a year for retirement.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.560]   But one does it five years earlier.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:23.920]   That first five years, there are so many things about it that are important.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:32.640]   You know, one thing is that first five years could be 1995 to 1999 when the S&P 500
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.400]   compounded at 28.5%.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:41.600]   On the other hand, the first five years could be two of the worst years in stock market
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.160]   history, in which case a great thing has happened.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:53.440]   It has given this young person an opportunity to put money away into asset class funds,
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:23:00.240]   index funds we all hope, that are down and dirty and make a great long term investment.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.920]   Always better in your youth to invest in a bad market than a good market.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.200]   That is a hard thing to convince young people of.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:18.080]   But that original $25,000 from that extra $5,000 a year that Nadine got in starting
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:24.160]   at age 25, you follow the bouncing ball on just that money.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.560]   You keep that money in equities.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.480]   It could literally mean an extra $7 million over their lifetime.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.400]   Now we all know, this is not a surprise to anybody, that stocks make more money than
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:38.800]   bonds.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.960]   We all know that stocks are more risky than bonds, that stocks are the gas and bonds are
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.440]   the brake.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:53.360]   And we all know that you certainly do not want to put a young person's money into stocks,
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.840]   which is one of the reasons with the wonderful Miriam and I were talking before we got started
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.080]   here about my 90 minute visit with John Bogle.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:12.480]   And my big complaint, and I thought I had a winner of an argument, was why, how could
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.400]   Vanguard be putting 10% of a 21-year-old's portfolio in bonds?
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:25.280]   Because every 10% in bonds you put into a portfolio that takes away from equities costs
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.680]   you one half of 1% a year.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.800]   That's magic.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.520]   Remember, I'm looking seriously about a half of 1%.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   And the answer is wonderful that John responded.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.720]   He said, this is not about making people more money.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.520]   He understood my position.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.760]   He understood the extra half a percent.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:54.560]   But the purpose is that Vanguard is trying to get people into a strategy that they understand
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.960]   it is both gas and brakes.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.760]   And that yes, when you're young, almost all of it should be in gas.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.920]   Well, I happen to believe that all of it should be, not almost all of it, but all of it should
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.840]   be because there is an expected return premium of about 5%.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:23.040]   Well, that's based on 90-some years of performance, where the bond, the long-term government bond
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:30.640]   compounds at about 5%, and the stock market compounds, talking about the S&P 500, at about
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.440]   10.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.960]   OK, here I am.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.360]   I'm looking everywhere I can to find an extra half a percent.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.920]   And I'm thinking, the decision to put money in bonds versus the stock market for a young
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.640]   person, particularly the supposedly 23% of young people who will not put any money in
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.520]   the stock market.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:26:00.640]   It just, it makes me so sad that somebody hasn't gotten to them to explain that in fact,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.800]   stocks are much less risky in the long term.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.680]   It's the short term that we have a problem, but we're not investing for the short term.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.800]   You all know that.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.880]   But I just want you to understand that when you're talking to a young person, that difference
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.720]   between the 10% and the 5 is 10 times one half of 1%.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:32.560]   And yes, it does mean that you could legitimately add another $10 million to your portfolio
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.560]   over a lifetime because you chose stocks over bonds.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.040]   In fact, I'm working on an article right now for a couple of months from now about making
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.240]   the decision as an investor to be all equity all the time your entire life.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.400]   What are the implications of that?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.640]   And how would you do that?
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.000]   One company versus thousands of companies.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.440]   Again, I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I want to make sure if you have not seen
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.640]   the study that was done by Dr.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:15.920]   Bessembinder that tracked all public companies from 1926 to I think about 2016.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   And then they published work on the study.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:30.720]   What they found was 4% of the companies were responsible for most of the great return of
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.360]   equities.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:38.320]   The other 96% of the public companies, many of them folding and going out of business,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:47.520]   by the way, the other 96 had a compound rate of return equal to what treasury bills got.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:56.240]   That is an amazing number, which means you've got to have that 4% in your portfolio.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:02.000]   We know from this study, it's easy to pick dogs.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.200]   By the way, one of the grandest, greatest performers in that 4% is General Motors.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.600]   And here's the beauty of the index fund.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.560]   It doesn't keep General Motors forever.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.400]   At some point, it's off the table.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:28.560]   And so what you get is with the index funds, another advantage is you do get rid of the
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:28.960]   dogs.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.480]   By the way, you got a lot of ligers in there too.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:40.560]   But it is a handful of stocks that drove the market to that 10% compound rate of return.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:50.800]   Beyond that, the academics tell us the expected rate of return is the average of all stocks
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.200]   in whatever asset class you're talking about.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:00.080]   But I have never met an investor who buys individual companies that ever believed any
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.800]   stock he picked would turn out to be average.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.520]   That's just not the nature of an investor.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   But I'll tell you, the average we all get with index funds is a lot higher than the
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.360]   average that the rest of the investors get with their portfolios.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.880]   And I think you all know that.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.640]   I'm looking for a half a percent again.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.280]   I see it.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.640]   I see it like I got to bend over and pick it up off the ground.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.680]   I mean, this is so simple to simply get lower expenses.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.320]   As you know, we can now-- I mean, this is amazing.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.080]   I'm 77 years old.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.360]   I started in the industry in the mid '60s.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.640]   We had loaded funds that charged 8.5%.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.280]   We did not have index funds.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.800]   We did not have ETFs.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.640]   We did not have target date funds.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:56.960]   We had actively managed funds that charged high expenses.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.640]   In theory, investors today, if they do what is laid out on a plate in front of them,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.760]   basically for almost nothing, they should make more money than I did over the years.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:15.200]   I know that will be left to the luck of when the market decides to go on long bull rides.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   But the bottom line is, today, we can get rid of so many of the expenses.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.040]   We don't have to pay a 5% sales fee.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.440]   Remember what happens.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:40.240]   When you pay somebody $500 out of $10,000, that means that that $500 grows in their family's
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.600]   pocket rather than yours.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.960]   And it does it for generations.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:56.000]   And that $500 is, again, likely costing about a half of 1% if it's taken out of an actively
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.360]   managed portfolio.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.480]   I'm talking now about all equities.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:09.520]   So no load, low expenses, and low turnover.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.720]   We didn't have many funds that had low turnover back then.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:21.280]   Investing has never been easier or simpler, however we want to look at it.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.960]   And it has never been available, in the best interest of the investor, anything like it is
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.440]   today.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:36.160]   That's why we got to make sure that we educate people how much better it is.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.360]   When I started out, the spread between the bid and ask on a stock was high.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.280]   The commissions were regulated.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:50.960]   You could pay $175 to buy or sell 100 shares of IBM back in the mid '60s.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:57.120]   And if you bought 1,000 shares through me, I got 10 times $175.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.440]   Look at what happens today.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.440]   It is nirvana.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.120]   It's investor nirvana.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.600]   The problem is one thing that has not changed.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:14.080]   There are still thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people who are working hard
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.800]   every day to make you or to encourage you to do it wrong.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.480]   And that is what you guys, I think, are doing, is making people aware of that.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.800]   So we get to index funds.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.640]   I mean, the beauty of index funds, when I look at all the things, the mistakes that
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:38.480]   people can make, high expensive, active turnover, trying to stock pick yourself, diversification,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.800]   huge, massive diversification.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.280]   My wife and I have a portfolio.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.840]   We happen to use the DFA funds and stuff.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:57.680]   Well, we have some Vanguard funds in our bond portfolio, but the reality is that by the
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.040]   time you put together a portfolio of some big and some small and some value and some
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:12.160]   growth and U.S. and international and emerging markets and REITs, we have over 15,000 companies
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.360]   in our portfolio.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.600]   And there's no reason that somebody starting out with a thousand dollars or even a hundred
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.480]   dollars can't do that or shouldn't do that.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.560]   So index funds, I think, are magic.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:35.520]   I've got somewhere on our website is an article entitled "30 Reasons I Love Index Funds."
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:43.280]   So I've never had any argument with global heads about index funds.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:49.360]   I think the reason that I've taken a little heat over the years is that I don't recommend
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.640]   that everything go in to the S&P 500 or the total market indexes.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.960]   I think that's where the disagreement has come.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:04.400]   We know all of these advantages, more tax efficient, but here's the one I like.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:18.160]   Because you know what, every time I'm looking for somebody to help me, whether it be a plumber,
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.120]   an attorney, a physician, I'm looking for competence.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:33.280]   I'm looking for ethics, and I'm looking for things that I could identify and consider
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:43.840]   dependable, and the index fund is almost the only kind of mutual fund that is dependable.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.400]   And how do I know that?
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.920]   Well, I know that if you look at the SPIVA report, again, I'm guessing you all are familiar
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.760]   with S-P-I-V-A, put out by Standard & Poor.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:02.240]   Every six months, they update it, and they show over the last 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 years,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:08.640]   how did the benchmark do compared to all the folks trying to beat the benchmark?
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:19.360]   And it turns out over 15 years, about 10% of the actively managed funds will outperform
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.880]   the benchmark.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.480]   Now, normally that means because they've done something different.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.760]   They've taken more risk.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.920]   Chris Pedersen wrote a great article.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:38.080]   I may have the wrong title on it here, but it's at A-A-I-I, but it's the cost of being
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:38.480]   different.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.800]   There is a cost of being different.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.160]   It means you might do better.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:53.280]   You might get a premium, but you also very likely will underperform unless the way you're
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.880]   being different is historically been better than what you're doing otherwise.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.560]   And I'm here to talk about that history a little bit here tonight.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:11.120]   But I do know this, that I can end up basically in the top 10%, and I don't need to know a
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.440]   thing.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.560]   I don't need to understand any of those 500 companies.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.120]   By the way, I've got one fund that's got over 5,000 different companies.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.920]   Small cap international value.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.200]   I don't need to know anything about any of them.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:37.040]   And I know from every, all the evidence that because I basically, we own them all.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.960]   That's what the index does with each asset class.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:49.760]   Theoretically, I am likely to be up around that top 10%, maybe it's 20%, but I'm not
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.200]   going to be falling out of bed.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.400]   And the problem is, you got Bill Miller.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.000]   You may not remember Bill Miller.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.640]   Bill Miller, I've forgotten the name of his fund.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:07.600]   I'm sure that Chris or Daryl are going to remind me here, but he had 15 years.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.400]   Then he beat the S&P 500.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.000]   Magic, truly magic.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.360]   And the money just poured in.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.040]   And then you know what the end of that story probably was.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.280]   He became one of the worst managers in the industry for a decade.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.960]   I mean, literally from the top 1% to the bottom 1%, dependable.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.120]   What a lovely, wonderful thing to have for our children.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:40.720]   If they're going to put money away for their retirement, something that we can say is dependable.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:49.040]   And of course we know we can save money on taxes when you have a mutual fund that has
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.920]   less turnover.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.240]   Well, yes, it's easy to save money in an IRA.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.600]   Better to do it in a Roth IRA.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.680]   I happen to be of a group.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:06.480]   I do not worry when you're 20 what the income tax rate is going to be, whether it's going
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   to be higher or lower than it is right now, and you're going to have this money you're
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.560]   putting away into a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k compounding tax free.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:24.880]   And then when you get to the age that you have to distribute, make your annual required
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.800]   distributions, you'll be thumbing your nose at them because you don't have to because
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.680]   you got a Roth.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.520]   And then you take it out and it's all tax free.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.400]   And let me just tell you what it feels like.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.160]   In fact, it's a fascinating memory for me.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:49.440]   When I think about how we fight with each other politically about taxes, when I came
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:55.120]   into the industry, the year before I got into the industry, the marginal tax rate for people
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.360]   who were making a lot of money was 90%.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.240]   The next year when I was really in the business, it was 70%.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:09.200]   And nobody I know that was, in fact, one of the reasons I wanted to be a stockbroker is
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.800]   because I wanted to meet people who had been successful.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.240]   I found out they weren't as magic as I thought they were going to be.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.600]   And I only stayed in the business.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.400]   I thought the conflicts of interest were terrible.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.120]   But I also found out that there wasn't all that much magic.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.560]   These people were working hard and being smart.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.640]   Didn't matter what the tax rate was.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:38.000]   They just loved working and they loved conquering the challenges of running a business.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.360]   And, of course, they all had expensive CPAs to try to figure out how to get around those
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.160]   taxes.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.920]   That hasn't changed, regardless of what the tax rate might be.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.360]   But here's where I'm looking for a half a percent.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.640]   I like this one.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.680]   This one's good.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.480]   I don't know if you ever spent any time going to Morningstar and comparing index funds to
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:03.280]   the average tax rate of the average fund.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:11.360]   And when I say the tax rate, what I really mean is how much did the return, was it reduced
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:19.520]   by the tax, assuming there was, in fact, the highest, using the highest tax rate?
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:27.440]   With the average actively managed fund, it's one and a half percent right off the top.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.640]   So if they report, they made it 13.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.320]   And that's what they're talking to the public about, we made 13.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:42.480]   But in fact, they made on average about 11 and a half, because taxes had to be paid on
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.120]   those actively managed portfolios.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.200]   You look at, for example, the S&P 500, the tax impact is a half a percent.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:58.640]   So theoretically, theoretically, here's another place where you could find an extra half of
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:10.960]   one percent, here's where I hope that I can make some headway with those who wonder why
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:17.680]   I have fallen off the wagon and are using other asset classes other than the S&P 500
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:25.760]   or the total market index, which, by the way, I see nothing wrong with using the S&P 500
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.800]   and the total market index.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:37.680]   I am not being critical of it, I am simply saying that I believe I have the risk tolerance
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.720]   to take a little more risk and get a substantial premium.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.120]   You have all, I'm sure, read Larry Suedro.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:54.320]   Larry Suedro would tell you that the reason that small cap and value and others get a
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:01.040]   better rate of return, it's no free ride, it's not magic, it's just more risky.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:09.280]   But there is some theoretical magic that goes on when you put these assets together.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:15.440]   And I'm going to show it to you the way that Darrell and, by the way, Darrell Balls, I
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.280]   think is with us tonight as well, along with Chris Patterson, there are two research guys
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:29.440]   and Darrell is the one that turns out, I think we have 160 tables this year that we've provided
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.040]   to people who follow our work.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.120]   But here's a simple one.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:44.880]   I go back to 1928, to 2020, look at the compound rate of return, CRR, over 93 years for the
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:58.400]   S&P 500, 10%, large cap value, 11, small cap blend, 11.9, small cap value, 13.1.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:05.280]   And I know what people will say, yeah, well, that was then, that was that 93 years.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.520]   Things have changed.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   And there's not going to be the premium for small cap value and small cap blend and large
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.240]   cap value.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.480]   And they may be right.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.320]   That's possible.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:24.800]   Because when we look back the last 20 plus years, we see that long-term government bonds
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.400]   have had a better rate of return than the S&P 500.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.880]   Maybe they're on to something the rest of us just have not gotten.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:42.080]   But I do know this, I don't blame the people who don't like volatility and risk for not
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   wanting to put any money in the stock market.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.720]   Because one year at a time, and if you ask me today, what do I think the market's going
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.040]   to do next year or the next 12 months?
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.720]   My answer is pretty clear.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:00.640]   I think it'll be somewhere in between a gain of 54% and a loss of 43.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.000]   I'm pinning it right down.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.080]   Or I could say the thing that so many people will say, well, I think we'll probably be
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.920]   up about 10% next year.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:17.440]   Well, the reality is on a short-term basis, there's nothing easy about investing.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:24.480]   You have to close your eyes and hold your nose or simply believe that you're investing
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.000]   for the long term.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.040]   You don't care.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.480]   In fact, you see a decline in the market as an advantage, not a disadvantage.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:39.200]   And to the extent that it's a disadvantage, as it would be to me, there better be some
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.160]   break on there.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:49.840]   And I'm 50% break and 50% gas, because I can't stand the loss of 60% to 80% of my portfolio
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.800]   in equities.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:58.080]   Yes, I know recently it hasn't gone down 80%, but it did go down 60% during that decade
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.480]   of 2000 through 2009.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.400]   I just don't want to do that again.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:10.800]   So I want you just to peek over here at the four fund combo, because I'm going to show
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.520]   you some numbers I think you'll really find interesting.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:20.240]   The small four fund combo has taken 25% out of each one of these four.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:27.600]   Now notice what that means in terms of the kind of diversification we're talking about.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.200]   The S&P 500 and the total market index are cap weighted.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:40.800]   So you are getting a view of ownership of the US public corporations, such that the
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.120]   bigger the companies, the bigger their impact on what you make.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:54.960]   Many people believe in rather than cap weighting, asset class weighting.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.840]   This is a very simple asset allocation, 25% each, that's it.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:06.320]   And the compound rate of return over that period of time was 11.7.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.680]   And the standard deviation was higher.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:19.280]   Now, by the way, the standard deviation looks not only at the downside, but the upside.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.000]   So part of that higher standard deviation includes going higher on the upside.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.840]   Higher on the upside, as well as going lower on the downside.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:33.280]   But I don't judge volatility one year at a time.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.160]   I don't know about you.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.520]   That would be an interesting thing to ask yourself.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.360]   What is the real measure of volatility?
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:49.680]   I might say for a 20 year old, the real measure of volatility is 40 years, or whenever you're
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.480]   going to start adding fixed income to the portfolio.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.120]   I'm going to show you that in a few minutes.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:00.560]   But I want you to look at what I'm trying to get young people to look at.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.400]   Think 40 years.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.040]   40 years, not one year.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.480]   Look at the bad times in 40 years.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.560]   I mean, there are some bad times.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:18.880]   Here, for example, by the way, about half of those public companies from 1926
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.960]   through the end of 2016, over the life of the company, ended up not making money.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.560]   So it's not like there isn't a lot of risk out there with individual companies.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:37.680]   But when you get rid of the individual companies and you're left with these indexes,
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.040]   here's the terrible times.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.400]   The worst 40 year compound rate of return for the S&P 500 was 8.9.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.840]   The best was 12.5.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.480]   That's pretty good.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:58.720]   What's interesting, you inflation adjust these periods of the best and the worst returns,
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.920]   and they come much, much closer.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:14.320]   Notice here with large cap value, 15.6, best 40 years, 8.8, about the same as the S&P 500.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.640]   Small cap blend, a little higher on the upside, not as low on the downside.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:29.280]   Small cap value, higher on the upside, not as low on the downside.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:35.760]   So you can see why I'm thinking that for a first time investor,
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.640]   I would like them to have some small cap value.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:45.520]   There are lots of companies, some will survive and be big winners, some won't.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.640]   But that's true with the S&P 500.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:54.400]   And then we look at the four fund combo.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.520]   I mean, you're really hiding in the weeds with the four fund combo.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.840]   And I'll show you why in a second.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.640]   But 13.8, I'm looking for a half a percent.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.360]   That's all I want.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.680]   I want to change a life with a half a percent.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.360]   It looks to me in the equity portion of that portfolio,
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.280]   yes, I can have the S&P 500, lots of big companies,
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.880]   lots of big large cap value companies, and then a lot of small companies.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.480]   This is US only.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:29.280]   And that range is 15.9 to 10.8.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:37.040]   So the worst 40 year period for that strategy is 10.8 versus 8.9.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.360]   It's about 2% difference for the worst outcome.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.000]   And of course, people want me to put the word guaranteed.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.320]   Stamp that right on the screen.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.440]   Unfortunately, we all know it.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.120]   These are all risky investments.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.560]   They, every one of them, each individually have a risk of going out of business.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.240]   It's hard to believe, but who would have thought?
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:10.880]   Remember, for those of you who happen to sneak into this presentation for young people,
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.520]   remember back to the time when they said,
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:19.040]   "As goes General Motors, so goes the United States of America."
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.000]   If General Motors is doing well, get on board in the stock market.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   So that's the risk range I want to see, not one year at a time.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.360]   I love this table.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.600]   My thanks to Daryl for doing this table.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.080]   Because what this table does,
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:47.760]   it takes those 90 plus years of individual performance
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.840]   for every one of those four equity asset classes.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:58.000]   And look at here, we've got the S&P 500, 1928 up 43.6.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.520]   Small cap blend, 42.9.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:05.440]   Small cap value, 32.4.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.000]   Large cap value, 24.6.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.840]   They all had a good year.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.680]   Even the four fund strategy was up 35.9.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.200]   A great year.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:23.680]   Who'd have thunk it was right before a year that people would remember forever.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.960]   Not many people remember 1928's returns.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:32.400]   Oh, but there's one thing about that year that's kind of interesting to me.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.720]   I looked at those long-term returns and I saw that small cap value is the best.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:45.680]   And yet here's small cap value down here towards the bottom.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.240]   Even in the good times.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.760]   So obviously, one year at a time,
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:59.840]   just as it doesn't tell you anything about the long-term performance of any asset class,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:04.480]   it also doesn't tell you who should be first over the long run.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:08.160]   Because we know in hindsight who was best.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:15.200]   But we know when we look one year at a time, it doesn't look nearly as pretty.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.640]   But I'll tell you what does look pretty.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.600]   I'm talking about people who don't have a lot of risk tolerance.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.720]   What does look pretty to me is the four fund strategy.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.400]   Look at it here.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.800]   I'm going to see how many years they were number one.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:37.520]   Of course, they can't be number one ever because it's the average of the other four.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:42.080]   But I'm sure there are some years they were, no, no, wait a minute.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.160]   They can't be number four either.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:50.640]   Which means they are forced to be either number two, three, or four in terms of performance.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.320]   But most of the time, they're right there in the middle.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.520]   Right there in the middle.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:02.160]   So when we look out at a period of time, like here's a 20-year period,
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:08.960]   which is not 40, but 20, there's the four fund combo.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.120]   Never at the bottom, never at the top.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.800]   Huge diversification.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.520]   It truly has more diversification than the S&P 500.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:29.760]   Now, somebody might say, well, total market index has small cap value,
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.480]   2%, not enough to move the dial.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.680]   I mean, it's fine that they have it.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.840]   It is not changing anybody's life.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:44.480]   You are not picking up the small cap value premium with 2% in the portfolio.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.080]   Oh, and by the way, just where we think they should be,
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.600]   the bonds are right down here.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.400]   Well, here's a 20-year period where T-bills were the worst.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:02.080]   S&P was 6.1, long-term government bonds 7.6.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.720]   Percent and a half better for bonds over the S&P 500.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:13.760]   Look here, S&P under the four fund, S&P over the four fund, S&P under the four fund.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:22.240]   And here's the challenge with owning small cap value.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.400]   This is another Daryl Ball's beauty.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:30.080]   This is the telltale chart.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.240]   And to the best of our knowledge, John Bogle named it.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:45.600]   It's a relative return of the S&P 500 versus U.S. small cap value, accumulated over time.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.440]   So it starts out 1930.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.600]   And when you see that line going down right there, that means the S&P 500
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:59.680]   is either losing less or making more than small cap value.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.800]   And then it came back and then went down, then it came back.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:07.440]   It really didn't break out for 13 years.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:13.760]   Well, I can tell you back then, nobody was waiting around for small cap value to break out
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.400]   because nobody had identified the asset class small cap value back then.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.000]   We know it now.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:30.320]   But over the next three and a half years, a rocket up 28.6% over the S&P 500.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:35.760]   And then it goes dormant for 19 and a half years.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.240]   Then another rocket, then dormant, then a rocket, then dormant, then a rocket.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.680]   And this goes through to 2019.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:51.200]   And as we all know, value has been doing better lately, but it still has not taken off
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:58.160]   like a rocket to get out ahead of what the S&P 500 has been able to accomplish.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.360]   The point here is this, and it's so simple.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:11.360]   Anytime you invest in an asset class that you're getting a premium, by the way,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.440]   this would be stocks over bonds too.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:19.040]   You are going to live through long periods of underperformance.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:24.560]   You are going to, if you are in the business trying to help people make money,
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.920]   and you have a diversified portfolio that includes value, as well as growth and small,
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:36.400]   as well as large and international, as well as us, et cetera, you are going to look like a dog.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.280]   This is that cost of being different.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.640]   So from 1995 to 1999, and I was in the business then,
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.200]   I have not been an investment advisor since 2012.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.240]   I am, and, but a lowly teacher and I'm loving it.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.040]   But I remember what it was like.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:57:02.720]   It was hell because for five years, while the S&P 500 was compounding to 28 and a half percent,
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.840]   our all equity portfolio compounded at 11.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:12.880]   I think that was easy to keep people staying the course.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.160]   Boy, that is when you're doing your business.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.240]   You're doing your work as an advisor.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.520]   But then we came back gangbusters the next 10 years.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.640]   Another mistake people make is market timing.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.160]   I said early, I confessed my sins.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.080]   I mentioned that I believe in market timing,
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:40.240]   but I do not believe in individuals doing market timing.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:47.200]   I do not believe that many individuals can even turn it over to a professional to do,
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:54.320]   because market timing requires you to make short-term decisions, which are often very bad.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:10.560]   Buy and hold over 40 years, it may only be.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:18.320]   That's a big deal.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.120]   Market timing turns people emotionally inside out.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.960]   And if you have struggles with having regrets for making mistakes,
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.720]   market timing is the worst thing you can do.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.880]   It is based on making mistakes.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:41.440]   Now see in the buy and hold index fund, you're making mistakes all the time.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.600]   Companies Enron was there at one point.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.480]   Eastern Airlines was there at one point.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.320]   So it's not like you don't have mistakes going on there.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:57.760]   But this all buy in, all in, all out, those are big, obvious mistakes.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.600]   So don't do it.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:06.880]   And one of the things I truly believe is that if you make that one decision up front,
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.760]   which is one of the reasons I am so in favor of target date funds
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.800]   for people who truly do not know what they're doing.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:19.680]   Or in some cases, for those who think they know it all.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.600]   That's another group.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:26.640]   But buy and hold is far, far superior.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.000]   I'm only going to take a second.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:28.960]   I'm going to check the time.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.640]   I've got 10 more minutes or so, I think here to go.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.120]   But I want to share something with you.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.320]   I talk about the work that Daryl does.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   This is an example of a tool that we hope will help people make better decisions.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.680]   This tool is called a fine tuning table.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.480]   The fine tuning table takes one asset, one portfolio.
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.640]   And who would call the S&P 500 one portfolio for life equity wise?
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.840]   John Bogle would have.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.000]   Early in the years when we used to have him on our radio show,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   he didn't talk about total market index.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.320]   He talked about the S&P 500.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.320]   So what do we know about the S&P 500?
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.080]   Well, here it is without any expenses taken out.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:26.400]   And here it is with the expenses taken out at the rate you would pay today.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.280]   And so you can see the good times and the bad.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:36.400]   And the bad are the red numbers here with the minus before them.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.200]   And there aren't too many bad times.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.680]   And the compound rate of return was 10.4%.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.380]   Normal.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.440]   Normal historically.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.160]   About the same as going back to 1930.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.600]   If we go back to 1950 or 1940, when you go back and include the depression,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.080]   it goes down a little bit, but not much.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.120]   Still around 10.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.800]   But Ted, here's what I want you to see.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.560]   I want you to see that, okay, the compound rate of return, ah,
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.880]   it was 10.7% for this particular 51 year period.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.440]   Standard deviation, 16.3.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.080]   I don't know what's, or 16.9.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.880]   I don't know what standard deviation is in the minds of most investors.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.840]   But I do know when I tell you the worst three months was a loss of 28.7.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.560]   The worst six months, a loss of 41.8.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.520]   The worst 12 months, a loss of 43.3.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:39.200]   The worst drawdown was a loss of 51%.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.640]   Peak to bottom before it goes back up to that peak, last peak.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:51.600]   And the worst compound 60 month annualized rate of return was a negative 6.7.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.040]   That was a terrible five years to be taking money out to live on.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:01.360]   So what can we do with that?
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.400]   Well, we can look at the other side over here, year by year, the bonds, all bonds.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.400]   Now I'm kind of embarrassed to suggest this information is pertinent because
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.680]   for so many of those years, the bonds were sky high.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.560]   And then they went down to nothing.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.640]   I got in the early 1980s, I got a five-year CD from the bank of Chicago,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.400]   paid 16% a year for five years in my IRA.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.440]   It was an amazing period.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.120]   So is this a legitimate period to look at?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.720]   Look, we don't know what the next 51 years is going to do.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.800]   Do you think there'll be any wars in the next 51 years?
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.040]   Do you think that we'll have higher interest rates or lower interest rates?
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.400]   You think we could have a period of high inflation?
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.560]   Does anybody in the world have high inflation anymore?
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.120]   Well, are there people that are worried we're going to have it
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.920]   if we keep throwing money into the pot to spend?
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.960]   I'm not taking a stand.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.320]   I'm saying, I don't know.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:16.240]   But I do know this, that if I, at 77, have half of my money, 50-50,
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:24.080]   half from bonds, half from stocks, I know that that changes the return.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.400]   And when the losses were losses, instead of 14, it was 4.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.360]   Instead of 26, it was 10.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.880]   Instead of 7, it was 3.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.920]   And on down.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.160]   In fact, the big loss was in 2008.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.080]   The 50-50 was down 21%.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:53.360]   And if you're a young person, expect that 21% loss again from a 50-50.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:59.840]   We like to think that the bad stuff in the past is not going to jump up and bite us again.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.840]   Well, let me tell you what happened from 1930 to 1939.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:12.160]   You actually lost less money than the S&P 500 did from 2000 to 2009.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.920]   Plus from 2000 to 2009, you had inflation.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.760]   But from 1930 to 1939, you had some deflation.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:27.200]   So you actually made money after adjusting for inflation, deflation in the '30s.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.800]   So what we saw in 2000 through 2009 was the same, basically, as what happened earlier.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:45.200]   We have this kind of table for the S&P 500 for what we call our worldwide
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.640]   ultimate buy and hold strategy with 10 funds.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.040]   Worldwide with four funds.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.400]   All US, the four fund strategy over that period of time.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.640]   We have an all-value portfolio.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.520]   We even have an all-small worldwide small-cap value portfolio.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.320]   In every case, we look at these different combinations of stocks and bonds.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.080]   Some of you may know that Larry Suedro has a lot of money
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.280]   in a combination of small-cap value and bonds.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:22.320]   And here's a great table for young people.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.600]   Another one of Daryl's beauties.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.680]   Here's the assumption.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.440]   We take that same S&P 500 and all those other strategies that I talked about.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.560]   And we assume we put away $1,000 a year in 1970.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.280]   $83.33 a month.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:49.920]   And every year, we increase the amount of that contribution at 3% a year.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.600]   What do we find out?
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:06:02.560]   We find out that we would have had with a 100% stock portfolio $2.4 million over the 51 years.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.200]   You would have invested $137,000.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.040]   If you were 50/50, you'd have $1.4 million.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:19.280]   Now, it's not going to surprise you to find out that some of these different combinations
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.480]   of asset classes come up with more like $5 million at the end of this period of time.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.640]   But there's a huge lesson here.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:36.400]   A lot of young people look at the value of their portfolio in the early years,
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   and they don't get very excited.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.400]   Well, they shouldn't get very excited.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:48.160]   Because when you put in $1,000, and at the end of the year in 1970,
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.160]   you're left with $1,022.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.760]   And somebody has told you, if you just put the money in the S&P 500,
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.520]   you're going to be rich someday.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.200]   You're going to be a millionaire.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.360]   By the way, in 1970, being a millionaire was a big deal.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.960]   What I find fascinating when I teach classes up at Western
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:12.080]   is to college students today, $1 million is still a big deal.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.080]   They really should be thinking $5 million, not $1 million.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.000]   But that's another story.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.880]   But you would understand this, who would be happy with $1,022 in profit?
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:28.640]   Well, the $22 isn't the amazing thing.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.200]   It's the $1,000.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.800]   For the first 10 years, it's really about what you put in.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.680]   It's not about what happened to it.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.720]   Later, it's about what happens to it that makes the difference.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.720]   But the celebration is not the profits.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.560]   The celebration is the foundation that you're building.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.120]   And slow and steady does win a lot of races.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.920]   And then, because I'm here,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.560]   we are here to help people at all stages, all stages of their life.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.840]   We have distributions.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.640]   I don't know how many different tables we have,
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   but this one happens to be a million-dollar investment
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.600]   and a $40,000 distribution, 4%.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:28.000]   And every year, it is increased by actual inflation over this 51 years
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.840]   so that you can see the impact of being all equities
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.960]   and how bad it can be compared to being 50/50 or 60/40.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.640]   And you can see that all of these columns,
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:49.280]   even the one that says all bonds, makes it to the bottom of the page.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:54.160]   And at 77, I'm not worried about 51 years.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.680]   But there are a lot of people who are going to retire at age 40.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.240]   I know it.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.000]   They're part of the FIRE movement.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.360]   I talk with them or answer emails to them often.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.960]   And they're for real, and they are likely to retire at age 40.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.520]   And that money is going to work for 51 years.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.680]   These are important tables.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.960]   We also have another table that shows flexible.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.480]   So we show 3%, 4%, 5%, and 6% distributions.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.240]   We show them at the first of the year.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:36.640]   And we have some where we actually show the distribution at the end of the year.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   What would that mean?
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.720]   It would mean that you, in order to make it through the first year of retirement,
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.160]   had to save a little separate pool here on the side.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.120]   And it does make a difference.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.720]   You'll see it in the tables.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.600]   Today, a new website was born.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.200]   Well, at least for us, a new website.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.560]   This is the new front page.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.520]   You're going to have a chance in a minute to subscribe to our newsletter.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:17.280]   And when you do, we are also going to send you a PDF copy of "We're Talking Millions."
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.240]   And I do hope.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.080]   I do hope.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.040]   This is my dream.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.160]   I would give this away to as many people as I can reach.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:33.040]   On Wednesday, I talked to a high school class somewhere back east.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.680]   And I'm hoping that every one of those kids actually has a copy.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.000]   My hope is to get it because it's a PDF.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.800]   As you know, you can send that to all your nieces and nephews and friends and co-workers
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:54.240]   because it is built to try to help people make better decisions.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:01.120]   The income of the three people who are here tonight on behalf of our foundation,
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:09.680]   Daryl, Chris, and myself, our total income for all three of us is one big goosick.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.720]   This is not about our life getting better.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.040]   It is truly about the lives of others.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.480]   So there it is.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.760]   Here's the place you can sign up here.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.400]   By the way, you can go to the website and do this.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.840]   Or I think some people will be able just to click through here and do it.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:42.000]   But that is my hope is you'll join us as a subscriber.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.720]   And we do an article every two weeks.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.280]   We do a podcast every week.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:57.680]   Very, very often, the podcasts are a combination of Daryl, Chris, and myself
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.280]   just answering your questions.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.840]   Very often, they're an interview I've had with somebody else asking me questions.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.080]   But we're looking for any way that we can to educate people.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.520]   Now, I did see that somebody had raised their hand.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:22.800]   And what I wanted to do, if I might, is I'd like to be able to hold questions, if we could,
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.400]   until after Chris makes his presentation.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:32.720]   And then all three of us will be here to answer questions, if that's OK with everybody.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:41.760]   If it's a question that you can't go on, that you really don't understand what's going on here,
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.080]   and answering that question will make a difference, of course, I'm willing to do that.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.880]   But in the meantime, what I want to do is I want to stop sharing.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:13:02.880]   And I want to introduce one of the smartest people that I know in the industry.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   And by the way, when I say in the industry, he has never been a stockbroker.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.840]   He's not a target financial analyst.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.280]   He's not a CFP.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.360]   He is an engineer.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.800]   And engineers sometimes understand better-- things better than stockbrokers
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.920]   and certified financial planners.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.800]   And by the way, Darryl Balls is also an engineer.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.160]   They're both retired.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   But Chris Pedersen joined us in 2016.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.400]   And he has done a whole bunch of work that's life-changing for people.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.800]   One is he has created the best-in-class recommended ETFs.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:04.320]   And if you are interested in how he selects those, then we have articles on that.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.760]   In fact, he may talk about it briefly tonight.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:13.440]   But the bottom line is that he has picked the best small-cap value,
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.920]   the best large-cap value, the best of all of the different asset classes
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.480]   that you could then put to work with our portfolios.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   And those could be done at Vanguard, commission-free.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:33.040]   But they're not all Vanguard because sometimes Vanguard doesn't represent the best-in-class.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:39.680]   But just for people who are Vanguard all the time,
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:47.600]   we also have a Vanguard ETF portfolio to try to accommodate those folks as well.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.080]   So Chris has changed the lives, I think, of a lot of people.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.080]   But the biggest thing that he did was develop the Two Funds for Life.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:02.480]   When I met with John Bogle, he was so critical of the work that
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.960]   I have done for many years because it was too complex.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.720]   He said, "You can't do that to people."
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.560]   And the great thing is that at that very moment,
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.560]   Chris was back home working on Two Funds for Life.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.920]   And he has a book coming out in the coming months.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.800]   I have read the book.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.560]   It is, I think it's just tremendous.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:30.960]   And Chris, would you please saddle up here and take over?
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.920]   Sure, glad to.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.360]   Just one disclaimer on those best-in-class funds.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.640]   Just like we don't know future returns, we don't know which funds are going to do best.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.680]   But we do try to pick them based on some objective criteria that we think
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:55.760]   gives them higher expected returns per unit of risk or per expense dollar paid.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:01.520]   And so hopefully they serve people well if they're patient and can stick with them.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.960]   So let me enter this.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:12.480]   The brief story, Paul kind of introduced it regarding Two Funds for Life,
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.480]   is that back in 2017, we were trying to come up with a way to
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.320]   offer investors a simpler approach.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:29.680]   And I loved the 10-step Boglehead list that was given up front,
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.520]   because our strategies really do align with those.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.440]   But there were two steps in that list that really mean a lot
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.240]   to the work that I've done on Two Funds for Life.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:45.120]   Step three, which is don't take too much or too little risk.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.520]   And step nine, simplify.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:53.200]   And this strategy is really aimed at both of those steps.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:59.360]   Now, when Paul and I worked this up in 2017 and Paul talked to John Bogle,
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.040]   that really-- it did light a fire under us to complete the work.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.520]   And it was in the fall of 2017 that we first introduced Two Funds for Life.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.320]   And I always thought it was super simple.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.080]   And one article was enough.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.240]   And Paul kept saying, well, I think there's a book in there.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.200]   You should go write a book.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:23.440]   And as is often the case, when you peel the onion on something
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.760]   and you dive into it and get into a little more detail,
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.720]   you realize that, yeah, you could actually write a book on that.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.960]   And over the years, the four years since we first introduced this strategy,
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.200]   I've received all kinds of really, really thoughtful questions from investors.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.040]   And so, of course, now it's not out yet.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.560]   But you can see there's a book worth of material.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:51.360]   And I'm going to try now that I have a whole book worth of material,
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.560]   Paul comes to me and says, could you summarize it in 15, 20 minutes?
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.760]   I'm doing this Bogle head thing.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.080]   So we'll see what we can do.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.240]   Hopefully, we can hit the high points.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.640]   And I'll be sticking around for the questions and question and answers.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.920]   So maybe we can go into a little bit more depth on some things as well.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.000]   But the gist of it is that we wanted, like I said,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.600]   to focus on these two questions tied to number three
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.840]   and number nine of the Bogle head strategy.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.640]   Number three, don't take too much, don't take too little risk.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.320]   And number nine, simplify.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.400]   So if we want to do something really simple,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.080]   the easiest place to start is with a target date fund.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.600]   A lot of investors today are defaulted into a target date fund
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.680]   in their retirement planning accounts.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:43.120]   In a 401(k), an employer will often have that as the default investment.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.560]   And in fact, over half, I think, of 401(k) participants
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.800]   have some of their money in a target date fund.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.520]   It's a very simple strategy.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.760]   It can be very low cost.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.280]   If it's based on a Vanguard target retirement fund,
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.800]   it can be very inexpensive.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.840]   And under the hood, it basically is built on index funds.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.600]   And what it does is it tries to adjust risk with age.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.800]   So you would invest in a fund that's tied to the year in which you plan to retire.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.200]   If you're planning to retire in 2060,
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.040]   there'd probably be a fund called the 2060 Target Retirement Fund.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.720]   And that's the one you would invest in.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.840]   And what would happen is, you know, in the early years,
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.520]   you would be primarily invested in stocks.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.800]   Here, let me pull up a pointer.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:38.240]   So you'd primarily be invested in international stocks and U.S. stocks.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.000]   But there would be, as Paul pointed out earlier, a little bit of bonds.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.360]   And you could argue that those bonds are there to smooth the ride.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.040]   But as Paul pointed out, they are a drag on the return.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.840]   And in all of the backtesting we've done,
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:59.120]   it does have the effect of lowering volatility slightly, very, very little,
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.400]   but lowering the amount of money that you have going into retirement
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.640]   and at the end of retirement substantially.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.600]   So that's a problem.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.800]   But before we go into that and how we might fix it,
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.360]   let's just look at this thing called the glide path.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:16.560]   What happens is, as you get to about age 40,
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.160]   the asset allocation starts to shift so that as you approach retirement,
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.960]   you're at about a 50/50 allocation,
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.160]   50% in investment grade bonds,
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:33.680]   plus some treasury inflation protected securities or TIPS.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.000]   So that combination adds to about 50% in your 50% in equities.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.040]   And the equity percentage continues to ramp down
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.080]   as you go into retirement for about seven years
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.800]   until you get to about a 70/30 portfolio,
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:51.120]   where you've got 30% in equities and 70% in bonds.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.720]   So if you want this simplest possible strategy for an investor,
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.560]   putting them in a target date fund does a lot of good things.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:06.960]   It takes into account this idea that your risk budget
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.880]   or your ability to take on risk declines with age
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.480]   because you have fewer years to work.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:16.960]   You have fewer years for compounding to work for you.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.240]   You have fewer years to recover from a drawdown or a loss.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.360]   And you don't have to think about
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.720]   how you're going to manage that risk posture manually
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.280]   by changing your asset allocation every year.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.480]   And it's very low cost.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.080]   And it just happens in the background automatically for you.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.640]   So the simplest possible strategy, just a target date fund.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.360]   But as I pointed out, it has at least one imperfection,
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.280]   this bonds in the early years.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.800]   It has another imperfection,
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.440]   and that's that there's limited equity diversification.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.200]   You're entirely in a cap-weighted asset class.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:58.720]   You have no meaningful exposure to small companies or value companies.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.560]   Yes, there are small companies in there,
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.400]   and there are value companies in there.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:07.040]   But the value companies are offset by the growth companies.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.960]   And the small companies are offset by the very large companies
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:17.920]   so that you get no exposure to those potentially higher return
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.760]   and admittedly more volatile but not always correlated asset classes.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.280]   So what can you do about it?
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.440]   What if somebody wants to get a broader diversification
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.520]   across a wider range of these types of stocks
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.960]   and also take on a little bit more risk in the early years?
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.440]   Well, what we developed in this two funds for life
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.560]   was the idea of adding some small cap value to the portfolio.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.480]   And we do it with or without age scaling
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.120]   and with or without a minimum allocation.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:58.640]   So in the book, we cover three strategies I call easy, moderate, and aggressive.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.280]   And the one that's in the middle that's moderate,
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.040]   you may have been exposed to before
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.160]   as what I'll call the classic two fund for life strategy,
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.120]   where you basically take your age.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.320]   In this case, it's worded as years to retirement,
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.520]   but I'm going to start with age.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.400]   If you take your age times one and a half,
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.600]   and you put that into a target date fund,
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:24.240]   and you put the rest into small cap value,
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.520]   what happens is that at say age 20,
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.560]   one and a half times your age is 30.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.600]   So you'd put 30% in the target date fund,
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:39.440]   and you'd put the rest 70% into this second fund or small cap value.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.000]   And basically, as you ramp that down,
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.520]   as you come up to retirement at age 65,
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.080]   it's age 66 and a half.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.840]   If you do your age, if it's years to retirement,
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.440]   it works out that you're zero right at retirement at 65,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.040]   if you're retiring at 65.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:04.480]   So this moderate strategy is that you're investing some in small cap value,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.560]   declining with age until you get to retirement
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.960]   where you're 100% in the target date fund.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.160]   And I'll show you in a minute how that plays out.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.480]   The other two strategies, the simplest one,
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.680]   is that you take 90% and put it in the target date fund,
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.920]   10% into the small cap value fund,
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.040]   and then you don't rebalance.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.080]   And the reason we described this really easy approach
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.480]   is that sometimes people won't have access
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.760]   to a small cap value fund in their 401k.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.000]   And if you have to access small cap value in a second fund,
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.280]   it's advantageous not to have to rebalance
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.560]   because it's hard to move in and out of a 401k.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.480]   So we model it that way.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.840]   And then in retirement, we use a very simple approach.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.280]   And we do this also for the more aggressive one
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.960]   I'll talk about in a second.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.960]   We call this nudge withdrawals.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:04.480]   So if you're taking out a 4% withdrawal in retirement,
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.240]   you just take it out of the asset class
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.640]   that is oversized, if you will.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.880]   So if your target is that you have 10% in small cap value
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.600]   and you've got 12 at that point in time
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.440]   when it's time for your annual withdrawal,
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.240]   you would take the whole annual withdrawal
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.680]   out of the small cap value.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:30.240]   If on the other hand, the target date fund was at 95%,
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.600]   instead of 90%, you would take the total withdrawal
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.120]   out of the target date fund.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.080]   And what that means over time is that you kind of ping pong
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.840]   back and forth and take it out of one fund or the other fund.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.120]   And it's much, much simpler than doing annual rebalancing.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.040]   And it produces a very similar result.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.480]   We document that in one of the appendices of the book.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.840]   So that's one of those examples of details that's in the book.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.600]   So we have this easy approach.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.520]   We have the moderate approach.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.840]   And then we have an aggressive approach
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.200]   where perhaps as you've gone through time,
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.320]   you've become comfortable with the small cap value allocation
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.880]   and you want to continue holding it into retirement.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.880]   And in this approach, and what we do
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.200]   is we take a higher multiple,
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.000]   2 1/2 times years to retirement.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.720]   And then we add 20% to that.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.440]   So you can't go over 100%.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:33.360]   So at age 20, 2 1/2 times 20 is, or I'm sorry,
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.680]   this would be 20, you're going to 65.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.840]   So you're 45 years before retirement.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.440]   45 times 2 1/2 is over 100.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.560]   So you're 100% in your second fund in small cap value.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.760]   And by the time you get to age 40, you start to ramp down
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.920]   and you ramp that second fund down the small cap value
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.400]   until you get to 20% at your retirement age
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.640]   and then you hold it into retirement.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.160]   So these are the three examples we model throughout the book.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.960]   We've got the easy, the moderate, and the aggressive.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.320]   This one is annually rebalanced during the accumulation phase.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.480]   And then we use the nudge withdrawals
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.640]   during the distribution phase.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.560]   So if we look at why you might want to do that
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   or what the impact is, the straight up target date fund,
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.800]   as I said, it does some really great stuff for you.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.320]   What we've got here is the amount of money
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.280]   you end up with as an end balance
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.640]   and the amount you end up taking out in retirement
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.680]   as a multiple, a real multiple of the amount you contributed.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.920]   And then down below, we have the drawdowns
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.320]   you would have had to have tolerate or experienced
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.760]   to get to that result based on the history from 1970 to 2020.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.120]   So if you just had a target date fund and you put in,
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.880]   I'm gonna just say $1,000 a year for 40 years,
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.480]   increasing with inflation,
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.560]   which means a real $1,000 per year for 40 years,
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.400]   that's $40,000 real contributed.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.800]   You would expect based on the history
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.680]   to be able to take out six times or yeah,
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:26.800]   to take out 5.5 times that or $220,000 during retirement.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.320]   And to be left at the end with six times that
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.480]   or six times the $4,240,000.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.320]   And this is based on 40 years of accumulation
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.480]   and 30 years of withdrawals.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.640]   Now, if you look at the easy approach
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:49.600]   where we put 10% into small cap value
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.160]   and 90% into the target date fund,
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.440]   you basically end up with 28% more
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:00.000]   that you are getting in terms of total financial benefit.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.760]   And most of it is at the end of your life.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.080]   It's at the end balance.
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.840]   Although you do have a little bit more,
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:11.360]   you have six times instead of 5.5 times
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.400]   that you're able to take out in withdrawals.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:18.240]   And the increase in the risk is very small.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:23.040]   So you go from 42% drawdowns to 44% drawdowns.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.440]   The difference there is 2%.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.200]   If you look at it on a percentage basis
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.600]   to make it more like the comparison at the top,
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.880]   that's a 5% increase in the drawdown depth.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.120]   Now, if you look at the moderate strategy,
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.080]   you get 30% more financial benefit,
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.400]   but it's more equally divided
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.160]   between the withdrawals and the end balance.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.280]   So most people I think would prefer that
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.600]   because you get to enjoy more of the money
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.560]   while you're alive.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.240]   And this is because you took more risk early on
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.400]   and that meant you had more money accrued
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.840]   when you got to retirement.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:01.440]   Admittedly, this means you have to tolerate more risk,
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.640]   but the risk is really concentrated in the early years
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.520]   when you have the ability to take that risk.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.760]   So here, the difference is that the maximum drawdowns
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.480]   over the period of time from 1970 to 2020
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.800]   were 47% instead of 42%.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.720]   That's a difference of 5%.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.280]   Or if you calculated it on a percentage basis,
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.680]   it's 12% deeper drawdowns.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:31.760]   47% is 12%, 1.12 times 42%, I believe.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.880]   And then if you look at the aggressive strategy,
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.160]   you get over double the financial benefit.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:45.040]   You get the most money nine times
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.480]   the real contributions available to spend in retirement.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:51.600]   18 times the real contributions left to heirs
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.760]   at the end of a 30-year retirement period.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.720]   But you also have to tolerate the most risk.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.360]   And it is concentrated in those earlier years
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.160]   to a large part.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:03.600]   The maximum drawdown here was 56%.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.240]   That's a difference of 14%.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.240]   Or about 33% more than 42%
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.400]   in terms of a percentage increase of the drawdowns.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.160]   So the bottom line is by adding some small cap value,
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.680]   you can substantially increase the amount of money
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.400]   that you have in retirement and to leave to heirs.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.000]   You do increase the risk that you have to tolerate
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.440]   in accrual and also potentially in retirement.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.640]   But those increases in risk are relatively small
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.880]   compared to the increases in the financial benefit.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.200]   And you can do it all with two funds.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.360]   And you can do it with or without annual rebalancing.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.680]   And you can do it with something super simple
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.240]   in retirement that doesn't require any rebalancing.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.360]   You can do it simply with these nudge withdrawals
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.240]   between the funds.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:57.280]   There is a huge amount of detail in the book.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.400]   So we do things like show the shape
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.800]   of the drawdown risk over time.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.080]   This is the most aggressive strategy I just described.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:07.920]   And you can see that the drawdown risk
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.840]   is concentrated in the early years.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.760]   As you approach retirement,
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.600]   there's less in the drawdown risk.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.320]   We show an example of how the asset allocation
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.600]   fluctuates over time.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.320]   There's a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.040]   The thing I think is really important though
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.640]   for investors is that in our back tests,
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.480]   we show what the best, the worst,
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.120]   so down here, the real high, real median,
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.000]   and real low balances were.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.920]   So these are the spending power you would have
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:46.560]   after accounting for inflation over time.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.280]   And you can see the price you have to pay
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.080]   that you might actually have to tolerate
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:57.120]   a long period of time where you have underperformed.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.400]   And that's part of the price that you have to pay
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.000]   to live through this experience.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.760]   But it also shows you at the end
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.880]   that there is a potential bad news scenario,
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.920]   median case scenario, and best case scenario
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.280]   in terms of real dollars,
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.600]   or you can look at it in terms of nominal dollars.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:19.440]   This page incidentally is all based on $833 per month,
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.480]   which is roughly $10,000 per year contribution.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.120]   So I'm not gonna go through this in any more detail
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.800]   because that's what the book is for.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.040]   But I just wanted to give you a flavor
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.560]   for what the strategies are,
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.680]   give you an idea of what the book will contain,
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:38.080]   and hopefully not trigger so many frustrating questions
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.640]   that we dominate the question and answer
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.200]   'cause I know Paul's generated some questions already.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.960]   So hopefully that's helpful,
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.360]   and I'm looking forward to getting the book out,
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.880]   and I hope it's valuable to some of you.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:57.680]   - That's great, Chris.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.280]   John, are you gonna take over
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:11.200]   and handle the list of questions that you've gathered,
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.560]   or how would you like to do it?
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.280]   - We can start off with a couple of general questions.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.880]   I actually have some that Miriam has provided me,
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.960]   and I took responses from my little form
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:25.920]   that I had sent out,
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.280]   and asked a couple of very general questions.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.840]   So I'll start off with a couple.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.240]   You actually referenced the White Coat Investor's
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.200]   notorious 150 best portfolio post that he did,
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.800]   I don't know, five or six years ago,
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.560]   and he actually has an updated post
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.400]   with 200 of the best buy-and-hold portfolios
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.000]   or the best portfolios out there.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.880]   And included in those portfolios
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.120]   are your ultimate buy-and-hold strategy,
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.680]   the Boglehead's Three Fund Portfolio,
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:03.920]   portfolios from Bill Bernstein, Rick Ferry, et cetera.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:08.160]   What's the best recommended portfolio
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.480]   for each individual investor?
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:17.280]   - Well, it depends on what they believe in, John.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.600]   It's what they trust,
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.200]   what they'll stay the course with.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.080]   I will tell you what,
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:25.280]   I've been on discussions with Rick
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.880]   and with Larry Suedro,
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.080]   and almost everybody in the industry will say
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.800]   the best strategy is a strategy
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.000]   that you will stick with through thick and thin,
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.360]   because they all do okay.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.400]   I will say this,
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.480]   if we really wanna believe the past,
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.760]   and that's all we have to make this judgment,
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:52.240]   I would think those that add some small
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.520]   and some additional value
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.080]   are going to do better than those that haven't.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.240]   We did a study that looked at 30 years worth of data,
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.280]   and it actually covered Rick Ferry's portfolio,
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:14.000]   JL Collins, and the three funds from Boglehead's.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.600]   We eliminated the fixed income from any of them,
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.840]   and just compared the equity returns,
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.360]   and our portfolios were amongst the best.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.920]   But it's not that we did it
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:33.200]   because of our high intelligence,
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.720]   so we got a better return.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.680]   We were willing to take more risk.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.160]   And what is interesting,
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:46.320]   go back to those four fund versus the S&P
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.720]   versus small cap value, large cap value,
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.680]   small cap blend.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.920]   That four fund strategy,
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.560]   I just think it's an amazing strategy
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.040]   because it's not doing anything that's outrageous.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.880]   I'm 77.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.400]   Half of my buy and hold equities are small cap.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.880]   Half of those are value.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.360]   Half of those are international.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.520]   I'm not afraid.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.680]   But then I've got 50% of my portfolio in bonds.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.040]   It appears I am afraid.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:20.160]   But you can see it really is about what's right for you
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.400]   if somebody is willing to stay the course,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.120]   like Chris said, target date fund.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.360]   There's nothing wrong with a target date fund.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:30.480]   According to a study that was done
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.280]   by Wharton School of Business,
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.000]   they looked at 1.2 of Vanguard's retirement accounts
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.080]   over about a 10 year period.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:43.440]   The people who use the target date fund
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:49.360]   had about a 2.3% per year higher expected return.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.480]   Now think about that.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.600]   I'm looking for a half.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.040]   2.3% better than what the people
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.960]   who don't have target date funds,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:59.840]   which means they probably don't have
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.600]   enough access or exposure to equities.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.240]   They need more, but they're afraid to do it.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.400]   The target date fund allows them to do it
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.560]   with a professional running it for them.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:13.680]   So hopefully we can convince them
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.680]   to go to the target date fund.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.400]   But gosh, I think about that extra 10%
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.600]   that Chris is talking about
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.440]   to put into small cap value.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.760]   This is not like a huge risk you're taking.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.080]   And yet it does have over a lifetime,
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.400]   really quite a large impact on the total return
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.920]   that you'll have to spend and leave.
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:39.840]   - Many boatheads go to sites
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.320]   such as morningstar.com for research
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.960]   on individual ETFs and mutual funds.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:47.200]   They'll look at information
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.600]   about whether it's a passive or an active fund.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.120]   They'll look at the sharp ratios.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.920]   They'll look at what asset style
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.880]   this fund is seeking to mimic,
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:01.440]   such as small cap value, such as mid cap,
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.200]   such as large cap value, et cetera.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.920]   Many boatheads will get hung up
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.760]   on the passive versus active debate.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.240]   And this might be a really good question
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.600]   for both Chris and Paul.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.160]   Can you tell us why such a fund
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.120]   such as Avanos US small cap value,
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.040]   which is presented as an active fund
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.720]   on Morningstar's website,
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.160]   isn't actually all that different
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:29.440]   from let's say the Vanguard S&P 600
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.720]   small cap value fund,
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.880]   which is presented as a passive fund.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.800]   And what are the advantages
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.800]   of having a fund like Avanos
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.720]   versus the S&P option?
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.840]   - Go man, Chris, you got it.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.120]   - Yeah, it is a great question.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.520]   And first of all,
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:58.160]   the definition of active versus passive is fuzzy.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:04.480]   So to me, what I don't want
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.560]   in terms of a type of active
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.960]   is somebody who's trying to time the market.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.200]   'Cause I think that philosophically disagrees
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.400]   with what the academics say works,
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.960]   what bogleheads are trying to do
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.080]   and what we're trying to do.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.280]   And one way to check that
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.040]   is to look at the stability of a fund style
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.880]   or exposure to small versus value
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:32.160]   versus growth versus large.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.320]   The Avantis fund is very systematically managed
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.320]   and it's very consistent
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.560]   in terms of its exposure to those.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.760]   One way to check that is
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.600]   if you go to a site like Portfolio Visualizer
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.160]   and run a regression analysis on it,
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.680]   you can look at factor exposures.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:52.480]   If it has a very high R squared,
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.880]   that means it's very predictable.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.920]   It basically means that what you're buying
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.680]   is something that can be described
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.320]   by these factors that academics have documented
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.360]   and understand in the market.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.280]   So Avantis has that quality
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.440]   as a very high R squared, 98, 99%, something like that.
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.960]   And so I don't worry that there is somebody
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.760]   behind the curtain trying to be the Wizard of Oz
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.960]   and second guess things.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.120]   So that's step one is,
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.800]   you know, it may be classified as an active fund,
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.200]   but I think mostly what that means
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.600]   is that in the world of ETFs,
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.920]   they don't have to disclose all of their trading
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.360]   so that they might get front run
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.920]   by somebody else in the market.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.600]   They don't have to be quite as transparent externally
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.600]   about what they're gonna trade before they trade it.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.080]   But it doesn't mean there's somebody guessing.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.280]   Now, the second thing is,
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.240]   how is it different from like a Vanguard fund?
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:53.840]   And the biggest difference is that it's gonna give you
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:57.360]   a little bit deeper exposure to value or size,
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.680]   plus they filter on quality.
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.120]   And what we know from books like Larry Suedro's book
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.520]   and lots of academic research
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:08.240]   is that when you combine multiple factors,
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.920]   exposure to multiple factors,
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   you get more consistent delivery of the premiums.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.960]   And so when I'm doing my selection,
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:19.600]   I look for size and value
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.680]   'cause that's the way our portfolios are built.
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:25.760]   But anything that people can cost effectively out
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.200]   on top of that is a bonus.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.360]   And the Vanguard funds have,
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:36.080]   if I do an analysis to look at their expected return
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:38.880]   after expenses, it's a little bit lower
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.320]   than the expected return I see in Avantis after expenses.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:46.160]   And I also see a little bit more balanced exposure
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.600]   to a wider range of factors.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.760]   So that's why Avantis won.
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.000]   If somebody believes in Vanguard though,
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.520]   and that's gonna keep them invested
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.160]   and they care deeply about expenses,
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.280]   and that's their headline,
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:00.800]   and they wanna go with the Vanguard fund, go for it.
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.480]   That's awesome, that's great.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:03.760]   Stick to your guns, do it.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.680]   The difference in the end of what you get
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:10.880]   is gonna have far more to do with your discipline
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.480]   to stick with what you've chosen
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:15.680]   and the basic asset classes you've chosen
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:18.160]   than the individual fund choice
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.080]   that you make within those asset classes.
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.680]   So I have absolutely no problem
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:23.360]   with somebody who wants to be all Vanguard
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.560]   because it's cost-effective.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.280]   That sounds great.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.760]   - Yeah, the other side, by the way, is Daryl here?
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.280]   Chris, do you know if Daryl's coming?
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.960]   - I don't think he's here.
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.720]   He may have had something come up.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:36.080]   - Okay, all right.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.320]   Well, I just make one comment, John.
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:39.200]   - Okay.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:45.120]   - The S&P 500 is an actively managed index.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.960]   Let's just be aware of that.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:50.640]   They don't have the same companies in the index today
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:53.600]   that they had 30 years ago.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.640]   So they are using a form of active management.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:01.680]   In fact, there was a study some years ago,
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.160]   I don't have a note of where to find it,
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.400]   but they had tracked the companies
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.200]   that had been thrown off of the S&P 500
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.200]   and compared the return of those companies
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:21.520]   with the companies that were put on the S&P 500.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:24.160]   And it turned out the ones that had been taken off
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.560]   had a better rate of return in the future
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.960]   than the ones that were left put on.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.280]   Now, this does actually make sense
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.640]   because it's probably simply a way to go to value
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:37.440]   because the reason people are being taken off
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.840]   is probably because they're not doing as well.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.920]   And then they may be become viewed as a value stock
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.600]   and people love growth.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.640]   I mean, if you look at the biggest companies
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:51.360]   on the S&P 500, I think we would agree,
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:54.480]   ah, those are really great growth companies.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.920]   And so it's true of the Russell 2000.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.240]   It too is reconstituted from time to time.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.240]   And in the reconstitution,
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:09.360]   there is a cost to that of getting in and getting out.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.400]   And like Chris said, there's front running that goes on
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.240]   and that hurts the shareholders when that goes on.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:19.680]   And the people at Avantis come from DFA.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:24.000]   DFA does everything they can
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.480]   to maximize the return for the investor.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:32.320]   And part of that is with their S&P 500
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.840]   or large cap US fund,
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.800]   they don't move in and out at the same time
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.800]   as everybody else.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.160]   They do it when the price is right by their definition.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:47.040]   - Sounds very good.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.280]   I'll pick a couple of questions
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.000]   from the starting out life chapter
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.040]   and we'll end our meeting,
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.760]   but don't get off.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:02.160]   We'll be able to open up our video and everything
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.840]   and chat one-on-one for a little while.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:09.760]   If a young investor has a set it and forget it portfolio,
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.600]   how long can they forget their portfolio
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.640]   before they get in trouble?
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:16.400]   Do you recommend rebalancing for a young investor?
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.680]   And if so, how often?
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.720]   - Go ahead, Chris, why don't you take that one?
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:24.560]   You've got younger people than I do in your family.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.600]   - Yeah, rebalancing is a way to keep the risk
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:35.200]   in line with what you set as your target
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.960]   or what you thought you could tolerate.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:42.640]   So somebody who's not gonna be rebalancing regularly
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.520]   on the plus side,
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:47.120]   they may also not be looking very regularly.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.240]   And for a young person,
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.800]   there's something that's not broadly understood
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.560]   or documented, it is in my book.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.600]   And that's that their regular contributions,
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:58.240]   especially if it's automated on a monthly basis
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.600]   are smoothing the ride for them.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.160]   So they have a volatility reducer
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.320]   just in the dollar cost averaging that they're doing.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.720]   The 10% allocation to small cap value
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:17.520]   is modeled in my book as an un-rebalanced asset.
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:20.160]   And it does keep the risk,
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.840]   the drawdown risk almost constant.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.720]   It still declines even with the target date fund
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:27.920]   as you get closer to retirement,
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:29.600]   but it bumps it up a bit.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.120]   So if the investor is skittish
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.240]   and they're going to be trading out of the market
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.480]   when they see a substantial drawdown,
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:43.200]   then not rebalancing is dangerous for them.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.400]   And so it's a behavioral question.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.120]   If an investor though grew up in an environment
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:50.960]   where they were taught to ignore
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:52.480]   the ups and downs of the market,
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.600]   they don't look at their account very often,
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.400]   they have a really solid understanding of the idea
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.800]   that if your account's down 60%,
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.640]   that just means you're buying cheap
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:06.320]   and cheer for the next contribution that goes in,
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.120]   they might be able to tolerate it just fine.
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.440]   So I think it's a very personal question,
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.760]   but when my book comes out,
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.920]   I think you'll be able to look at some examples.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.680]   There's actually quite a few examples in there
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:20.080]   of un-rebalanced portfolios,
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:22.880]   and you can see what the impact is.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.480]   It can be pretty substantial, yeah.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:30.000]   - And we have to remember that the whole idea
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.320]   of rebalancing is basically to take from the rich
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.280]   and give to the poor.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.840]   And the poor are the asset classes
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.840]   that haven't been doing so well lately.
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:46.160]   If in fact, a small cap value
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:48.720]   is a better investment for the long term,
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:51.920]   by punishing it for its premium,
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.160]   you are taking away from what you're likely to make.
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.280]   Now, having said that,
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:03.280]   when we get into the fixed income versus equity question,
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.440]   I think rebalancing probably has some meaning
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:09.680]   because when I was an advisor,
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.560]   I always, I told my prospects and my clients,
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.160]   if you follow my direction,
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.080]   I guarantee you will lose money.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.840]   And given that I can make that guarantee,
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.120]   let's be real serious
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.120]   about how much money you're willing to lose
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:28.160]   and not go beyond that.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.360]   And if you have that kind of an agreement
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.840]   with your client,
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:38.960]   your job is to maintain that limit of exposure to risk
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:41.360]   because you have a choice.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:46.480]   I wrote a book once 101 Investment Decisions Guaranteed
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.160]   to Change Your Financial Future.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.280]   It's also free at our website.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.720]   But the reality is it's a decision
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.280]   whether you are going to rebalance or not.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.880]   It is a decision whether you think you have the ability
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.640]   to see into the future or not.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.960]   And if you can,
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.720]   then you should be a very different kind of investor
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.680]   than if you can't.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.520]   I can't.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.880]   I have absolutely no ability.
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.600]   In fact, I have so little ability to see in the future
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.800]   and so little desire to be involved
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:28.880]   in the process of investing.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.560]   I have almost no interest in my own account.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.880]   Somebody manages our money.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:39.200]   My wife and I have our money managed by somebody.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.320]   I don't wanna be part of it.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:46.160]   I do have emotional attachment to money.
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:50.000]   And so it makes me, if left to my own devices,
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.760]   I make bad decisions.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:52.560]   I know myself.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.720]   So I've got a real good advisor.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:55.680]   They take care of it.
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:56.720]   We're doing fine.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.480]   We over-saved.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.880]   So maybe we don't have to get the same return
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:03.520]   as somebody else might feel they have to get.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:07.920]   But everybody in this business, I think, knows
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:11.120]   it's about controlling emotions.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.880]   And what I do love about Chris's work
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:19.360]   is you can choose how much emotion you wanna have,
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.160]   but everything else is automatic.
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:24.960]   Particularly if what a person does
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.400]   is put their money in a target date fund, period,
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.640]   and maybe 10% in small cap value.
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:32.480]   Simple, simple, simple.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.800]   And no reason to be involved.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.760]   - One more question.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:42.400]   What is the best advice for a young investor
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.240]   just getting started in their investing life?
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:48.880]   Balancing career, budgets, family, student loans,
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.080]   and beginning investments.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:53.760]   If you have more than one piece of advice,
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.480]   what is your best advice?
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:02.320]   - Well, I'll take a shot at that first, Chris.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.240]   I know you'll have something very thoughtful.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.360]   You're good at that.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:14.160]   I honestly believe if they will simply read,
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.800]   we're talking millions,
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:25.440]   and take those 12 decisions seriously,
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.920]   and do those things,
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:32.160]   the low expenses, the right amount of equity,
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.600]   et cetera, all of those things.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:34.480]   They're all simple.
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:39.040]   The advice really is get an education.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:44.000]   Remembering that whatever you do with your money,
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.280]   there are thousands of people,
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.520]   if not hundreds of thousands of people,
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.880]   I want you to stop doing that right now
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.280]   and do what we recommend.
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:57.440]   Because we have a better way.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:00.560]   Have you looked at cryptocurrency lately?
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:02.560]   Why our people have made a ton of,
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.920]   you haven't been in crypto.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.120]   Are you kidding me?
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.760]   Come on, let's get into just part of your portfolio.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.840]   I mean, it's a wicked business.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:13.360]   I promise you, having been in it for three years,
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.880]   it is a wicked business.
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:17.360]   There are people who care a lot,
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:22.480]   but I've always looked at being in the drug business
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.920]   and being in the securities business
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:29.520]   as two ways to make a ton of money, a ton of money.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:32.160]   I'm not surprised that young people
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:34.320]   get into the business of selling drugs.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:36.800]   It's a good way to make a lot of money.
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.640]   Well, it's a bad way to make a lot of money,
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:43.680]   but it can lead to same thing in the financial industry.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.280]   But the way you make a lot of money
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:50.320]   in the financial industry is you do bad things to others.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.920]   And I don't mean everybody's evil.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:52.880]   I'm not saying that.
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:59.760]   But the money that Bernie Madoff made is peanuts,
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:02.640]   peanuts compared to what mutual funds
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:04.960]   take out of people's pockets over a lifetime.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:08.560]   They talk in the press every once in a while,
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:11.920]   people overpaid by $11 billion this year
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:13.040]   or something like that.
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:16.480]   They never, when I see those,
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:20.640]   they never say people paid $11 billion
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.920]   that they shouldn't have.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:27.760]   And that's $11 billion that could have grown for them
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.800]   at 6% a year or 8% a year, whatever,
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:33.040]   and then been passed on to their kids.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.920]   That's the real cost of bad advice,
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.240]   of all those years and years of compounding less money.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.240]   So my goal, and I don't have much longer
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.960]   to be able to do this stuff,
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:49.520]   is to get those basic lessons.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.760]   And you already, you read the lessons.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.320]   Most of the lessons are right there
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.400]   in what the bogleheads believe in.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:59.680]   They just left out the value and the small,
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.880]   but that's what I'm hoping for.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.240]   That would be the advice.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:06.960]   Get an education first.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.360]   Chris, you've got to have some idea.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.240]   - Yeah, I guess I would, first of all,
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.240]   I love the way the question was phrased
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.320]   because it was balanced.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:23.680]   It's the person asking the question realizes
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:26.160]   you have short-term, medium-term, long-term goals
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.360]   that you have to work on and work on in parallel.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.480]   So I think I would encourage somebody
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.760]   who asks that question to, yes, be balanced.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.120]   You don't have to wait until you've done all of one
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:40.720]   to do the next, to do the next.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:42.320]   You can work on all of them in parallel.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:48.080]   And it's important to balance life along with saving.
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:49.360]   You don't want to suffer forever
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:51.760]   just so you can hopefully have a rich retirement
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:53.520]   only to die before you get there, right?
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.960]   You've got to enjoy life along the way.
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.520]   So the be balanced, I think would resonate
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:59.520]   with the person who asked the question.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.600]   And then I know you asked for my best advice,
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.760]   but I would make it a compound sentence.
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:09.200]   And I would say, don't learn the wrong lessons.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:11.840]   And this kind of goes to Paul's comments
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.560]   about you need to learn, you need to study.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:20.080]   You can take a ride in your car and text and drive
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.920]   and not have anything bad happen
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:24.480]   and learn that texting and driving is okay
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:25.280]   until it's not.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:28.480]   You can do that with drinking and driving.
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:30.240]   You can do that with investing.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:33.840]   The problem with investing is that it takes 20 years,
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.400]   30 years before you have meaningful data
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.320]   to derive patterns.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.040]   And so unless you are willing to study history,
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.520]   if you try to learn from your own investing experience,
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.200]   you'll learn a lot of the wrong lessons.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.600]   And so I think so many people, they do that.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:53.600]   They invest in an asset class
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:55.520]   or the stock market or bonds
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.520]   and it goes sideways for a year
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.600]   and they decide, okay, I'm never gonna do that again.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:03.840]   So I think be balanced
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.840]   and don't learn the wrong lesson.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:08.000]   That would be my starting point
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.160]   for good advice to a young investor.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:13.440]   - I certainly think that fits
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:15.120]   in the category of best advice.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:18.000]   Thank you so much to Paul Merriman
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.120]   and Chris Petterson in this presentation of,
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.360]   "We're Talking Millions."

[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:57.520]   (upbeat music)
