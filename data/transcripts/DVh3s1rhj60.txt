[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Now this evening I should like to call your attention to the chapter that has been read
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.760]   to us, namely the first chapter in Paul's first epistle to the Thessalonians, taking
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:23.440]   particularly perhaps the first part of the fifth verse, where we read "Our gospel came
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:35.560]   not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance."
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.720]   But I don't propose, as I say, merely to deal with that statement, though it is the key,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.580]   as I want to assure you, to the entire chapter, but I want also to look at the entire message
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:58.920]   with you, because I want to try to show that in this chapter the great apostle deals with
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.880]   a very modern problem, perhaps the most pressing and urgent problem confronting the Christian
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.840]   Church at this present time. And that problem is none other than the problem of evangelism.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.680]   I know that it's not always referred to in those terms at the present time. The term
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.600]   that's implied at the moment is the problem of communication. This is just another instance
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.400]   of the way in which we fool ourselves by changing terms. We don't talk so much as we used to
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.360]   about evangelism. We feel that we are living in a different world, that people are different,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.520]   and that we are different, so we've got to have new terms. And now the problem is the
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.400]   problem of communication. But of course it's really the same old problem, the problem of
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.980]   evangelism. And as we know, every section of the Christian Church is very concerned
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.520]   about this problem, and has been engaged in trying to deal with this problem for many,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.160]   many years. Many commissions have been set up, many gatherings have been held, many books
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.680]   have been written on the subject. There is a feeling that somehow or another the Christian
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.400]   Church is failing to get a message over to the world that is outside. The position is
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.360]   that we believe that this message and this alone can deal with the problems of mankind.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.480]   But the question is, how can we communicate this? Or, there's another term, a new one
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.080]   which I've forgotten for the moment. How can we articulate the gospel? Same thing, it just
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:01.040]   means preaching, but it's articulation now. How exactly are we to do this? Because we
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.680]   are told that we are living in the post-Christian era, we are told that we are living in the
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.280]   atomic age, in the scientific age. And the idea somehow is that men is now altogether
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.080]   different and that it's no use doing what the Church has done and in the way she has
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.920]   done it throughout the centuries. That we must have something new. There must be some
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.400]   new way of evangelism and of communication of the gospel for these reasons. And as I
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.840]   say, great effort and endeavor has gone into the discovery or the attempt to discover how
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.600]   exactly we can do this. Now there are some, as you know, who feel that the answer is that
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.360]   we need a new message. We want a new gospel. They say it's no use asking the modern men
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.240]   with their scientific knowledge to believe what his forefathers believed. It's no use
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.880]   asking the modern men to believe in this kind of three-tier universe. He knows too much
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.600]   scientifically to be able to accept the miraculous and the supernatural and so on. There's a
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.240]   great movement on the continent of Europe associated with the name of a man called Bultman,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.400]   which says that the greatest hindrance to the acceptance of the message of the New Testament
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:39.640]   by the modern men is the fact that unfortunately there are these accretions, these additions
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.520]   to the essential message, such as the virgin birth and the miracles worked by our Lord
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   and by the apostles and others, and all this idea of the supernatural and so on. And he
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.560]   teaches and so many follow him, that the one thing to do is to get rid of all this supernatural
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.120]   and miraculous element. We must demythologize the gospel we are told before it can possibly
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.600]   be accepted by the modern men. And there are many others who are propounding their theories
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.120]   and their ideas. You've got numbers of them in this country, and we've got their imitators
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.640]   in Great Britain, and they're found, as I say, on the continent of Europe. These are
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:31.760]   men who say that what we need is a new message for this new age. Man come of age, man grown
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.680]   up, and that we must find a new message for him. But then there's another big school
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.440]   of thought which says, no, that isn't what's needed. It isn't so much a new message that
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.400]   we need. What we need is new methods. And these people concentrate entirely on this
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.040]   question of methods. And what they generally do is something like this. They say, well
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:07.200]   now, how does big business succeed? How does any enterprise succeed in the world? And they
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:15.800]   look around and they discover that the success is achieved as a result of advertising. And
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.440]   you need a lot of money to advertise, so they collect it and persuade people to give it.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.840]   And they present themselves and promote themselves and put themselves forward. A great advertising
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.920]   agency comes into being. And then they say that these agencies use these instruments,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.960]   television, radio, and all these others, and that they understand the psychology of the
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.600]   people, the psychology of salesmanship, and the church must become interested in these
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.880]   things. She's got a commodity to sell, as it were, a message to give to the people,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.080]   and she must learn from big business and from the advertising people as to how this can
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.400]   be presented and put over. And so we shall achieve success.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:08.280]   And as you know, a great deal of attention has been paid to this question of method.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.880]   Particular types of services arranged almost to the minute with particular items, everything
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:20.280]   designed to appeal to and to please the modern man and his palate. And it's argued that as
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.400]   long as we adopt these new methods, that the people will come and listen to us, and the
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.200]   gospel will be propagated and will begin to influence the lives of the people.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.840]   Well, I mustn't weary with all this, but it is important that we should be aware of
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.460]   exactly what is happening. And the argument is that if we do one or the other of these
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.720]   things and perhaps both of them together, well then the church has some hope of getting
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:53.640]   her message over to this post-Christian world, to this atomic age. I'm not going to wear
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.480]   you by analyzing those things in detail.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:08.120]   My whole position is simply this. That all this, it seems to me, is entirely wrong, and
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.800]   for this reason, that it's based on the assumption that we are faced with a new position. And
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.600]   that is something that I cannot grant for a moment. There is nothing new about the problem
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   confronting the church. The church has always had this problem. And that's why I'm calling
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.680]   your attention to this particular chapter.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:36.720]   For what we have in this chapter is an account by the Apostle Paul of how the gospel was
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.880]   propagated and how churches came into being at the beginning and in the first century.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:50.380]   We have here what is said by the scholars to be his first epistle, and that's interesting
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:56.400]   in and of itself. But what he does in this chapter, as you noticed in the reading, is
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:04.120]   to remind these members of the church of Thessalonica of how the gospel had come to them, how they
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.760]   had ever become a church. He's writing a letter to a church and he reminds them of
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.840]   how they'd ever become a church.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.200]   Now I want to show you, and it's a very simple thing to do, that when the Apostle went to
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.160]   Thessalonica, he was confronted by precisely the same problem as confronts us at this present
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.560]   time. And that is why I'm saying that instead of wasting our time in trying to discover
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:36.520]   a new message or to discover some methods used by the world to bring success, all we've
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:43.640]   got to do is to go back to the New Testament and discover how it happened at the beginning.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.520]   And then if you like, read your church history and you'll find that all the great eras and
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.600]   epochs in the history of the Christian church, when she has succeeded most of all and masses
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.360]   of people have been converted and have been added to the church, have always been those
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.200]   periods when they've reverted and gone back to the apostolic method.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.640]   Indeed, I do not hesitate to make bold with this assertion, that you can try anything
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.560]   else you like. You can have your conferences and congresses and spend your millions in
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:24.280]   advertising. It'll achieve nothing finally. We must return to the apostolic manner and
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:33.360]   to the apostolic method. And here the great apostle tells us exactly what he did and how
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:41.000]   it happened in this first age. There's no need to consider anything else whatsoever.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.280]   Well then, what is it that happened? The apostle tells us quite simply. Let me remind you of
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:57.560]   his position when he went to Thessalonica. Here he is, a little man, nothing much to
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:05.760]   look at. The Corinthians said about him that his presence was weak and his speech contemptible.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   Paul didn't look like a film star. He was nothing to look at at all, most unprepossessing
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.720]   and just a few people with him. And he goes to this city. What sort of place was it? Well,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:26.240]   it was a pagan city, a part of Macedonia, what is now Greece. They had no background.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.240]   We're told today, you see, that the modern man can't follow our preaching because he
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.080]   doesn't know anything about justification. He doesn't understand the terms. That's why
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.800]   they're bringing out these new translations of the Bible almost every week. The idea seems
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.520]   to be that if only we get the scriptures in the language of Tom, Dick, and Harry, everybody
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:52.600]   will believe it. They say they don't understand these terms of yours. Well, they didn't understand
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:59.320]   them in Thessalonica. They had no background whatsoever, as I'm going to show you. But
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.400]   here the apostle goes, and as a result of his visit and his preaching, a church came
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:12.860]   into being. How did it happen? Well, the apostle tells us exactly here in this one chapter.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:19.760]   It's an amazing summary of the apostolic method of evangelism. And he tells us that there
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:28.320]   were two big factors. The first was, of course, the preaching of the apostles. This was essential.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.720]   Our Lord had given the message to these men. He'd given them the commission and the men
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:39.400]   did. And they'd gone out and they'd preached. This is always an essential. You must have
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:46.240]   preachers. We must have preachers in these homelands. You must have preachers in other
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.280]   lands which still can be described as being pagan. And I hope that every young person
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:13:00.520]   here tonight realizes this. We must have preachers. Now, I'm a believer in books and in reading.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:06.080]   But you know, there is no question about this, it is the spoken word that has always been
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:14.480]   honored supremely by the Holy Spirit. Preachers, truth mediated through personalities. And
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:21.160]   as you think of the teeming masses in many countries today, South America, Asia, Far
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:28.960]   East and other parts, there is a crying need of preachers. Men and women who will go as
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:36.040]   these apostles went over their world, preaching this gospel, preaching this message. Paul
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.520]   and these other preachers. The preacher is needed as much today as he's ever been.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:49.440]   Oh, I know that amongst these new ideas and new methods that are being propagated and
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.720]   praised at the present time, there are many who say the day of preaching is finished.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.920]   What we've got to have is what they call dialogue, which means discussion, you know.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.760]   But dialogue sounds so much better than either of these magical terms with which we delude
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.520]   ourselves. We must just sit down and talk to people. Others say that all we've got to
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.200]   do is to spend our time reading modern literature and studying modern art and drama and go and
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.320]   talk to people about things like that. And we've got others who say we must go in for
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.960]   politics and discuss politics and social conditions. All these things are being put before us and
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.800]   advocated. But I'm here to remind you that God's method has always been the preaching
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:40.680]   of the gospel. And there has never been a greater need for preachers than at this present
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:47.960]   time. Nothing can substitute for preaching. Very well, but that was the first factor only.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.760]   There's a second factor. I wonder whether you've ever noticed it as you've read this
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.840]   chapter. Did you notice it as we listened to the reading tonight? There was a second
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:07.360]   vital factor in the spread of the gospel in the ancient world. What was that? It was the
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:13.760]   life and the witness and the testimony of the members of the Christian church. Listen
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:19.800]   to Paul saying that. He says here that in verse 6, "They became followers. He became
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.560]   followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   Holy Ghost." Listen. "So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:44.120]   For from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.760]   in every place you were faith to God, Lord, is spread abroad so that we need not to speak
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:56.320]   anything. For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.800]   how we turned to God, etc." Now this is the most vital matter. You see what the apostle
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.320]   is really saying is this. He said, "You know, you good people, you members of the church
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:11.480]   of Thessalonica, you're making my preaching very much easier. What I'm finding now,"
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.120]   said Paul, "is this, that wherever I go and I begin to preach, people stop me and
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:25.000]   they say, 'Ah, you were the men who preached in Thessalonica. We've heard about you.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.840]   We've heard the news of what happened there as a result of your speaking and preaching.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:36.360]   This news about the amazing things that had happened to these people in the city of Thessalonica,
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.760]   it had spread abroad. Everybody was talking about it. Not only," he says, "in Macedonia
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:49.360]   and in Achaia, but everywhere, in every place this was being talked of." And Paul says
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.640]   there's a sense in which we don't need to speak anything now because they seem to
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:00.400]   know about it. The news about you has opened the doors for us and the task has been made
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:07.000]   much easier. Now my friends, this is the most important matter. I've sometimes had a fear,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.840]   you know, that we're rapidly getting to the stage in which there'll only be two or three
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.880]   preachers, if that many, in the world and the rest of the world will be listening to
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.240]   them on tapes or on television or something else. Everybody sitting back and listening
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:27.400]   as if that is the way to evangelize the world. It isn't. You need preachers, but you need
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.240]   the testimony and the witness of the members of the Church, whatever the preaching may
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:39.800]   be. If it isn't verified and substantiated by the lives of the people in the Christian
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.400]   Church, it'll be of no avail. And this is what the Apostle tells us happened in his
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:52.120]   day and generation. Now I confess that I hadn't fully realized the tremendous character of
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:58.400]   what he says here until in 1961 when I had the privilege of visiting the land of Greece.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.000]   And then I realized something of what this chapter is saying. He says the news spread
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.120]   abroad, he said, not only in Macedonia. Now let me give you a bit of geography. Thessalonica
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:20.080]   is up at the northeastern tip of Greece. And the hinterland, the section of country behind
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:26.320]   it, it's a seaport as you remember, the country behind it is known as Macedonia. So it's not
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.840]   a bit surprising that what had happened under the preaching of the Apostle in the town of
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:38.440]   Thessalonica was being talked about in Macedonia. But he says not only in Macedonia, but also
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:46.920]   in Achaia. Where's that? Well, that is the part of Greece that we now know as the Peloponnesian
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:54.520]   Peninsula. It's the part of Greece that is south of the Corinthian Canal. We saw a picture
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:01.200]   of it in the lecture this morning by Dr. Schultz. It's that lower portion of Greece. And this
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:08.920]   is what I discovered in 1961 and it amazed me and lit up this whole passage for me. I
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:16.960]   did a journey from Corinth to Thessalonica and I found it was a most arduous journey.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:23.120]   We had to cross a portion of sea, then we went in a car and we literally had to cross
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:30.560]   three high mountain ranges. It was quite a difficult journey in 1961. It's quite a considerable
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:39.560]   distance over the most difficult terrain and country. And yet, you see, the Apostle says
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:46.480]   that what had happened up there in Thessalonica had spread, the news of it had spread, right
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   away down over these great mountain ranges, right away down to Achaia. They had no television,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.000]   they had no radio, they had no telephone, they had no telegram, no newspapers. But this
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.240]   astounding thing was being talked of and was being spread from mouth to mouth so that when
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.200]   Paul even went round to the southernmost tip, they were ready for him and they were waiting
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:17.960]   to receive his message. My dear friends, this is the most important matter at the present
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:25.480]   time. We need preachers, evangelists, but I say we equally need men and women in our
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:31.760]   churches who open the door for the preacher, who proclaim the message in their lives, who
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:38.520]   attract people to come and listen to the gospel because they've heard of the marvellous things
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.200]   that happen to those who believe this particular message.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.160]   Now these were the two great factors. The book of the Acts of the Apostles makes the
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:53.960]   point frequently how the ordinary church members as well as the apostles and other preachers
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:21:01.560]   spread this gospel. It has been a leading factor in all great revivals and reformations.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.680]   You got it at the time of the Protestant Reformation. Everybody knew when a man had become a Protestant
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.120]   he became an object of conversation and of comment. The same was true of the Puritans
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.920]   in England and the Covenanters in Scotland, the early Methodists. Everybody saw what had
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.320]   happened to them and they talked about them. This astonishing thing that had happened in
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:29.120]   the lives of the people and it made others, perhaps merely out of a spirit of curiosity,
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.040]   go along to listen to the preaching that had produced such a result.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:42.000]   These were the two factors in the first century. They are the two absolutely essential factors
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.560]   in this our century also. Very well, there are the two main elements, but they combine
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:58.200]   together. What did they combine to do? They combined to present this message. Now what
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:07.720]   is it? Here is the other vital thing. Well, the apostle puts it like this. Our gospel
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:15.280]   came not unto you in word only. What is the message of the Christian church? Alas, that
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.680]   one has to ask the question, but one must ask it. Because there are people out in the
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:26.160]   world, one meets them constantly, who think that the message of the Christian church is
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.400]   nothing but a protest against the war in Vietnam. They think that that is Christianity. That
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.160]   is what they hear on the television and on the radio. That is what they hear from the
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.920]   lips of so many popular preachers. It is a protest against that war and other wars, a
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.160]   protest against the bombs. It is always a negative protest. It is a political, social
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:54.480]   message. They think that that is Christianity. But my dear friends, by definition it isn't.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:01.560]   The message is a gospel. And what does that mean? Well, as you know, the word gospel means
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:09.760]   good news. And this, you see, means at once that the others are no Christian message.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:17.080]   It's not good news to protest against a war. But the essential message here is good news.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.960]   It's the most thrilling good news that has ever come into the world. And that is how
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.600]   these people received it at Thessalonica. And that's how others heard about it. It
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:36.000]   is some amazing message, some wonderful proclamation of great good news, a gospel. And if what
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.040]   you and I preach and represent doesn't give people the impression that it's the most
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:48.760]   wonderful and glorious good news that they've ever heard, you and I are failing completely.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:55.200]   And we are unworthy of the name of Christian. Our gospel. Oh, let's never forget this.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:02.160]   Let's be certain of the message. And then he goes on to say this interesting thing.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:13.440]   "Our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also." Now here's an interesting thing.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.240]   You see, when the apostle says that the gospel did not come in word only, he means that it
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:26.120]   did come in word, but not only in word. Is this clear to us? I wonder. It's a very vital
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   point as I'm going to show you. Let me give you an illustration. A man may come to me
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.520]   and say, "I hear that you had a cold last week. Did you run a temperature with your
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:47.080]   cold?" What's he saying? Well, he's saying that it is possible to have a cold without
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:54.200]   running a temperature, but that you may have a cold with the temperature. So he says, "Our
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.280]   gospel came not unto you in word only." That means it did come in word, but there was something
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.880]   in addition to the word. Why do I take this trouble to emphasize this point? Well, here
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.680]   again, you see, it's something that one is compelled to do. For the popular teaching
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:17.800]   today, the preaching that gets the publicity and the popular applause is the preaching
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:25.520]   that tells us that the gospel is something that does not come in word or in words. What
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:32.680]   is it? What is Christianity? Well, they say, you know, Christianity is a wonderful spirit,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.880]   wonderful spirit that possesses the men. There was a slogan a few years ago that put it like
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:44.760]   this, "Christianity is caught, not taught." You know, it's a marvelous spirit, wonderful
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.600]   brotherhood and friendship, goodwill and love to one another, the sort of Christmas spirit.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.000]   And they say this is Christianity. They say, you know, the great trouble in the past has
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.560]   been that there have been too many theologians. And they said it's this and it isn't that,
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:07.040]   and they described it and defined it in words, and they insisted upon particular things.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:16.400]   But they say this is entirely wrong. Christianity is a spirit. It's a quality of life, not so
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:23.640]   much a doctrine as a way of living. Well, I'm simply to say this, that that view is
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:29.800]   a complete and utter denial of what the great apostle tells us here and everywhere else,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   and what indeed the whole Bible tells us. The gospel comes in word, in words. And if
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:44.920]   it doesn't, it isn't a true gospel. Very well, what are these words in which the gospel
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:51.120]   must always come in a most extraordinary manner? The apostle gives us a summary of it in the
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.920]   last two verses of this one little chapter. "For they themselves show of us what manner
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:03.480]   of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:09.640]   and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom ye raised from the dead, even
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:15.960]   Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come." There are the words. Let me put it
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.640]   to you. Let's go in imagination and listen to the apostle Paul preaching to these people
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:31.360]   in Thessalonica. There they are, I say, pagans, not even Jews, they hadn't been brought up
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:41.400]   from the Old Testament. Polytheists, idolaters, and so on, living the kind of life we'll soon
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:48.560]   see. How did the apostle preach? What did he say to them? Here's the problem of communication,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:55.880]   the problem of evangelism. These people, utterly without any knowledge of this terminology,
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.800]   everything the apostle had to tell them. What did he preach about? What is the Christian
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:05.640]   message? What are the words in which we convey it? Well, you notice that he started in this
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   way. He started by telling them about God. How he turned to God from idols to serve the
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:27.320]   living and the true God. This is how the apostle preached. He said, "You know, you good people,
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:33.560]   you are worshipping your idols and you don't realize that you're doing something that is
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:40.000]   foolish and utterly vain. What are your idols? They're simply creatures that you've made
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.320]   yourselves. In those days, as you know, they would make gods out of wood or out of stone
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.400]   or out of some precious metal. They'd carve them. We've been seeing this in these wonderful
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.600]   lectures we've been privileged to listen to every morning in this institute. They made
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:03.160]   these gods and then they said, "You are my God," and they'd build a temple to the God.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.000]   And then they'd take their offerings and they'd bow down and they'd worship their gods. And
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.480]   Paul dealt with this and he showed them the utter emptiness of it. There was nothing there.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.280]   These gods are nothing but the projections of their own minds and imaginations. They
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.960]   have no being. They can't do anything. They can't achieve anything. But they've worshipped
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:30.520]   them as gods. And he pointed this out to them, that they're just deluding and fooling themselves
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.960]   this idolatry. You get this in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Indeed, you get
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.040]   it in the Old Testament. There are two Psalms that deal with this in a very wonderful manner,
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.640]   full of most divine sarcasm. "Look at your gods," says the Psalmist. "They've got eyes,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.600]   but they can't see. They've got hands, but they can't use them. They've got lips, but
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.840]   they can't speak. They've got legs. You've given them legs, but they can't walk. And
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:02.680]   you are like the gods whom you've made, idolatry." The Apostles started with that. That was their
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:08.920]   kind of life. And he showed them the utter emptiness and vacuity of it all. But you see,
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:15.200]   he didn't stop merely at enunciation. He pointed out to them the seriousness of all this. He
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.720]   said what makes it serious is this, that while you have been worshipping the gods that you've
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:29.480]   made yourselves, you have not been worshipping the only true and living God. You've been
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:37.800]   worshipping lies. There's nothing there. You've called lies truth. But they're lies. But there
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:47.880]   is a true God. You have worshipped dumb idols, useless masses of substance. But there is
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:54.760]   a living God. And so he began to tell them about the God who had revealed himself to
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.320]   the children of Israel, the Jews. The God who had given this marvelous manifestation
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:10.120]   of himself in the Old Testament scriptures is the true God. This is not a lie or a fabrication
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:19.160]   of the creation of man's mind. He is God from eternity to eternity, the author of all things,
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:26.920]   truth in himself, just and righteous and holy. The God who is light and in whom is no darkness
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   at all, the true God. Yes, but also the living God. And so the apostle told them about how
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:41.360]   this God had created the world out of nothing. The first verse in the Bible, "In the beginning
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:51.280]   God created the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that in them is." The living God,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:58.200]   the God who interferes in the lives of men, the God of history, the God of providence.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.480]   He gave them this exposition of the great message of the Old Testament and he pointed
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.560]   this out to them. He said, "You've been ignorant of this. That's why you've made your dumb
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:13.920]   idols and have worshipped them. But this is the fact. You all have been made by God."
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:20.000]   And he says, "This is why it's so serious. This is why it's vital to you. That if you
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.440]   die as you are in your ignorance, worshipping your idols, you will go to condemnation, everlasting
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:35.720]   misery." He talks, you see, about the wrath to come. In other words, he told them that
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:41.760]   God had made the world and had made men in his own image. He'd given men certain powers
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.480]   and propensities. He'd made them responsible. And that whether men realize it or not, he
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:53.320]   has got to give an account of himself to God. That it is appointed unto all men once to
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:33:00.200]   die, but after death, the judgment. And he told these people that this great God, the
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:07.600]   only true and living God, was going to judge the whole world, them included, and that they
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.080]   would be judged according to the law that he'd given to his people, the Ten Commandments
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.880]   and the moral law. These are the standards by which they were going to be judged. The
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:25.320]   wrath to come and the eternal destiny that was to follow it. He preached the true and
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.800]   the living God and showed them that all this was vital to their present position and to
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:37.120]   their eternal destiny. That was how the apostle preached.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.520]   And my dear friends, it is only when you and I return to such preaching that we will be
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   truly able to engage the interest and the attention of the modern men. For the world
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.720]   is full of idolatry. It doesn't take the same form. We're not so crude as they were. Men
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.200]   no longer make their idols in that way. They make them now into the shape of what we call
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:06.120]   murder cars. And they worship them. Literally, I know many men whose God is their murder
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.440]   car. They're always talking about them. They spend most of their time cleaning them, getting
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   them to look better than somebody else's and always getting a better... They live for their
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.720]   murder cars. Others live for their houses. I've known parents who've literally worshipped
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.360]   their children. They thought about them, they schemed about them, they dreamt about them.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.840]   They'd sacrifice anything for their children. The children were their gods. I've known wives
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.880]   regard their husbands as gods and husbands rarely regard their wives as gods. They've
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   turned them into idols. The world is full of idolatry. Wealth, sex, prosperity, these
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.600]   are the things for which people are living. They're thrilled by them. They're moved by
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   them. Their whole lives are governed by them. That's your religion. Those are your gods.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:00.040]   The world is as full of idolatry tonight as it was in this first century. And so what
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:07.040]   is needed is this apostolic preaching that starts with the only true and living God over
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:13.840]   all, the judge of the ends of the earth and the wrath to come. And how every one of us
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   will have to stand before him. Well dear me, Sir Summon, I thought you took a little time
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:27.960]   just now to say that the message of the church was what you call gospel, good news. It doesn't
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.440]   sound very much like good news to me at the moment. You're preaching wrath and judgment
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:40.440]   and terror. Is that good news? Of course it isn't. But I'll tell you what it is. It is
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:46.360]   the introduction to the good news. And I have a feeling that the masses are outside the
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   Christian church today because we inside it have forgotten the introduction. Let me solemnly
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:36:00.200]   remind you of this my friends. The gospel of Jesus Christ does not start even with the
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   Lord Jesus Christ. It starts with God. It's no use going to people and saying come to
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:15.480]   Jesus or come to Christ. They say we couldn't care less. Why? Because they've never seen
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.600]   any need of him. That's why they don't come to Christ. They've never seen any need of
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:27.000]   Christ. The only men who truly comes to Christ is the men who've seen his own condition
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.840]   under the condemnation of the law of God, facing God in the eternal judgment, hearing
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:39.400]   the thunderings of Sinai, being confronted by the test, and realizing that he's an utter
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:45.600]   and a complete failure. It is only such a man that is ready to listen to the gospel
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   message concerning Jesus Christ and fly to him as the only hope of salvation. The preaching
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:37:00.160]   of the message of the Christian church is a message that starts with God, the only true
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:07.440]   and living God. And it is only as we realize our condition before him that we are ready,
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:16.040]   I say, to receive and to accept the message of the gospel. What is it? Well, I needn't
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:21.400]   keep you. We are familiar with this. This is where we start, isn't it? Instead of starting
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:27.280]   with what the Puritans used to call a good law work first. The trouble in the church
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:32.520]   today is that the law work has been neglected. There are too many people who've never repented.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.000]   They don't know what it is. They've taken on Christ as a friend. They want to walk down
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.240]   the streets of life with heads erect and never have another problem. No, no. We must start
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:49.240]   with a law work. The law leads to the gospel. And there are no true conversions without
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:54.840]   a law work. You can bring people to religion. That's a very different thing from making
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:01.240]   Christians of them. But having heard the law and having seen the position, then comes the
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:06.880]   glorious gospel. What is it? Well, here it is. "And to wait for his Son from heaven,
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:13.280]   whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus." Having shown them their terrible plight and
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   predicament, the apostle began to tell them about Jesus. He told them about this man who'd
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:27.800]   lived in Palestine, told them about his extraordinary birth, those quiet years when he just worked
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.800]   as a carpenter, and how at the age of thirty he began to preach. And the astonishing and
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   amazing things that he did, his preaching, his understanding, and his miracles. Jesus!
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:46.200]   But who is Jesus? Here's the question. They say, you see, that the gospel doesn't come
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:51.240]   in words, that you mustn't be theological, you don't need doctrine, but you can't preach
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   without it. The question is, who is Jesus? Is he only a man? If he is, we're all damned
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:05.560]   and hopeless. But who is Jesus? The apostle told them. "Even his Son from heaven."
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:15.880]   What's this? The doctrine of the incarnation. You can't preach the gospel without doctrine.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.000]   The very beginning of the gospel is to say that when the fullness of the times was come,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.680]   God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:33.680]   the law. Jesus, Christ, Son of God, God and men, two natures in one person unmixed, the
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:42.040]   person of the Lord. He preached Jesus to them and told them who he was, that God had visited
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:49.040]   and redeemed his people, the person of Christ, attested by his miracles and so on. Jesus.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:58.680]   But then he went on to say this, that this Jesus had delivered us from the wrath to come.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:07.040]   What's this? Well, it's more theology, I'm afraid. You can't get away from doctrine.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   If you don't know the truth about the person of the Lord, you're not a Christian, my friend.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.480]   But what's this statement about his having delivered us? Well, it means this, you see,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:25.280]   that Jesus didn't come into the world just to teach us how to save ourselves. That Jesus
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:32.280]   didn't come just to give us an example. Jesus came in order to deliver us. And he has done
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:38.920]   the one thing that is essential to it. What's that? Oh, this was the great theme of the
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:45.560]   apostle. He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:52.560]   righteousness of God in him. God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.840]   their trespasses unto them. What's it mean? Well, this is what it means. He has taken
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:04.840]   our trespasses and imputed them to him, laid them upon him, made him to be sin, smitten
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:12.000]   him, struck him. We beheld him stricken, smitten of God. The great doctrine of the atonement.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.640]   You can't be a Christian without this. You can be a pacifist, a socialist, and many other
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:24.880]   things, but you can't be a Christian. This is the essence of Christianity, that the Son
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   of God came into the world in order to take our sins in his own body on the tree, in order
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:40.040]   to receive our punishment by whose stripes we are healed. This is what he preached. The
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:46.600]   theology of the atonement, the doctrine of the atonement, the substitution, the fulfillment
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:53.600]   of what John the Baptist said, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   world, which delivered us from the rusticum." Christ dying on the cross, the innocent dying
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:11.240]   for the guilty, the good dying for the vile. He bore our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.800]   and he died, and they buried him in a grave. Is that the end? No, no, listen. "And to wait
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   for his Son from him whom he raised from the dead." What's this? Well, I apologize. It's
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:32.440]   the doctrine of the resurrection. There's no gospel apart from the literal, physical
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.880]   resurrection. Let the clever men say what they will. Let them attempt to philosophize
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:42.720]   it away, as some were trying to do in Corinth so long ago. It comes to nothing, for it means
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.720]   nothing. We are saved by the fact that Christ literally rose from the dead, having made
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:57.000]   the grand atonement. If Christ had not risen from the dead, our preaching is in vain, and
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.040]   your faith is in vain. You are still in your sins, and you are under condemnation. "Delivered
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   for our offenses," says Paul to the Romans, "raised again for our justification." What
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:20.720]   is the resurrection? It is God's proclamation to the whole cosmos that the Son's work is
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.960]   complete, that he finished it, that the law is satisfied, God satisfied, everything is
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   satisfied. The resurrection, the literal, physical resurrection, which incidentally
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:40.520]   also was the thing that gave the final proof that Jesus of Nazareth was indeed the Son
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.560]   of God, declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness,
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   by the resurrection from among the dead. Here it is, the doctrine of the resurrection, but
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:44:00.600]   he hasn't finished, you see. To wait for his Son from him, he not only rose from the dead,
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:08.240]   he ascended. Do you remember the ascension? He ascended, passed through the heavens, and
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:16.080]   took his seat at the right hand of God. And there he is seated, waiting until his enemies
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.600]   shall be made his footstool. But this isn't the end. There is a day when he will come
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.960]   again to wait for his Son from him. The Son of God is going to come back into the world,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it, not for salvation this time, but
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:37.840]   for judgment. He won't come as the babe of Bethlehem. He'll come as the King of Kings,
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.440]   and as the Lord of Lords, riding the clouds of heaven. And he'll come to judge the whole
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   world in righteousness. And he will destroy sin and evil and all that belong to that realm.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:57.420]   And he will set up his glorious kingdom of righteousness and of peace. Jesus shall reign
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:04.520]   and inherit the Son, and his successive journeys run. His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:12.080]   till moons shall wax and wane no more. The whole universe will be restored to its pristine
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:18.760]   condition and perhaps even more, and shall be glorified. And the Son will hand back the
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   perfect kingdom to the Father, and God shall be all and in all. That was what Paul preached
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   in Corinth. And you can't do that in twenty minutes, can you?
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:45.520]   Christian people, if you object to preaching of the gospel, you are denying the gospel.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:52.520]   This is the message, and you mustn't leave out any part of it. The gospel comes in word.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   In words. And those were the words then, and they're still the words tonight. But, you
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:11.240]   see, I haven't finished. If I were to stop at that point, in a sense, my preaching would
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:20.520]   be in vain tonight. That alone does not account for the spread of the gospel and the rising
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:28.720]   of Christian churches in the first century or in any other century. Listen, our gospel
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:35.720]   came not unto you in word only. It did come in word, and there they are. But also in power
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:47.040]   and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance. What does he mean? Here's the whole secret.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   Not only of the apostles, but of all the great true evangelists throughout the centuries.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:05.520]   Here's the secret of your Protestant fathers, those Puritan preachers, Whitefield and the
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:12.920]   others in the eighteenth century. Here's the secret. What is this? What does he mean by
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:18.120]   saying, "But also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance"? To whom does
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   the assurance apply? In the first instance, it applied to the apostle himself. Do you
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:29.240]   know, says Paul, to these people, when I was preaching to you at Thessalonica, it wasn't
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:35.640]   simply that I was speaking and uttering words. I knew that I was clothed with the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:40.520]   I knew that I was nothing but a little channel in the vehicle, and that the Almighty God,
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:46.600]   the Holy Spirit, was taking me and using me and driving my words to your minds and hearts
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   and consciences. I did it with assurance. I knew. You see, the position seemed hopeless.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.560]   What was there for him to build on? These people were ignorant. They knew nothing. They'd
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:03.120]   been living a life of debauchery and evil and sin and vileness. He describes this in
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:09.320]   so many places. Second half of the first chapter of Romans, 1 Corinthians 6, that's how they
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:15.040]   were living in this seaport town of Thessalonica. What had he got to go on? Oh, what he went
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   on was this, the Holy Ghost. And he felt the power, and he had this great assurance that
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:32.680]   he was being used. You know, the apostle is so concerned about this that he describes
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:39.080]   it in a little more detail in the next chapter. Let me just note it in a moment. Here it is.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:44.720]   He says in verse 4 in the next chapter, "As we were allowed of God to be put in trust
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:51.720]   with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God which trieth our hearts.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:49:01.760]   For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness,
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.840]   God is witness, nor of men sought we glory, neither of you nor yet of others, when we
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.920]   might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, and so on." Do you realize what
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   he is saying? The apostle Paul never pleased men. You can't imagine the apostle Paul tripping
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:28.560]   lightly onto a platform and then cracking a few jokes just to put the audience right.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:35.000]   The thing is unthinkable. It's insulting to the very name of the great apostle. He had
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.680]   no tricks. He had no methods, manipulating lights and music and other things in order
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:47.560]   to get people into the right condition to receive. No, no, he eschews it all. "I determine
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:52.680]   not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified. And my speech and
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:58.080]   my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom." He knew all about it. Greek
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   rhetoric and all the tricks of oratory. He dismissed them. He rejected them. He eschewed
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:12.120]   them. And here he repeats it again. He never used flattering words, never got round the
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:19.360]   audience, never ingratiated himself with them. No, no, he was a herald of the gospel. He
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:25.000]   proclaimed the words of the message and the Spirit was upon him and his total reliance
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.440]   was on the Spirit of the living God. He had assurance of it, power and the Holy Ghost
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   and much assurance. And that, I say, has been the characteristic of the church and her preachers
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:46.160]   in every period of reformation and of revival. And there is no hope for us until we return
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.840]   to this. We must be fools for Christ's sake and in simplicity be laughed at and derided
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   by the world, but trust the message and the power of the Holy Ghost upon it. That was
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:05.400]   in the apostle. But he says that the Holy Spirit was working in them also and he must
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:11.160]   have been. For how could ignorant, pagan people like this have any connection with such a
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:17.720]   message? They had no background. It was the Holy Spirit. At first, as they listened to
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.200]   him, they didn't know what he was talking about. But gradually they began to feel that
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.780]   he was speaking to them and that this was true. Something was gripping them. Something
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:32.680]   was moving them. They said, "It's right. It's true of me." And they got into trouble
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:37.280]   and they were unhappy about themselves. They'd never heard this before, but it became living
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.400]   and real. They were convinced and convicted. And they saw their terrible predicament. Then
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.600]   they heard this wonderful message of the Gospel and they believed it and they submitted to
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.520]   it. He says, "You became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost." But they gave proof and evidence that they
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:08.000]   had really received it and truly believed it. What was the evidence? Well, I'll tell
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.520]   you the evidence. "They themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:20.520]   you and how you turn to God from idols." This is the evidence.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:27.160]   This is the test of whether we've received the message or not. Not that we may come forward
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.920]   at the end of a meeting or sign a card. No, no. And then wonder the next day what we've
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:37.880]   done and be back where we were before in a few weeks. The evidence is this, that you
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:44.880]   leave your idols. You turn your back on them. You turn to the living and the true God from
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   idols and you begin to serve him. To serve the living and the true God, which means that
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:53:00.840]   you begin to worship him. He becomes the Lord of your life and you live to his glory and
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.280]   to his praise. You put into practice now the answer to the first question of the Shorter
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.800]   Catechism of the Westminster Confession. What is the chief end of men? The chief end of
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. Serve the living and the true God. And they
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:25.280]   gave further evidence. You became followers of us. They listened to the apostles and they
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:32.040]   joined the company and of the Lord. They became members of the Christian church and listen,
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.400]   they didn't merely do it as a kind of flash in the pan, it went on. "Remembering," he
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:43.400]   says without ceasing, "your work of faith." Not just believism, easy believism. "Your
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:52.440]   work of faith." Faith without works is dead. "Your work of faith. Your labor of love. Your
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:54:00.040]   patience of hope." They didn't merely start, they went on and they persisted and they gave
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:06.360]   themselves to it. It became the biggest thing in their lives. This was their great characteristic.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   And still more amazing, you received the word in much affliction, persecution, derision,
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:22.000]   sarcasm and scorn. But it made no difference to them. Having received the word in much
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost, you could do what you like to these early Christians.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.600]   You'd never make them deny the faith. You could ostracize them, it didn't matter. You
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.520]   could put them to death, throw them to the lions in the arena, it made no difference.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:46.520]   In spite of the affliction, in the affliction, joy of the Holy Ghost. And they went on doing
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:51.760]   it. And the result was, as Paul tells them, they'd become a phenomenon. And everybody
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:58.440]   was talking about them. Everybody in Thessalonica was talking about them. Everybody in Macedonia,
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.840]   everybody in Achaia, everywhere in the then known civilized world, they were talking about
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   this phenomenon. And this is the only hope for us at this present time.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:17.480]   Come with me for a final visit to Thessalonica. You see that group of people standing there
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:23.760]   on the street corner? They're talking together about politics, the injustice of the Roman
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:30.680]   Empire in imposing its taxes upon them and so on, exactly as men do now. And then the
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   man suddenly passes by. And one of the company says to another, "Do you recognize him?"
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:44.000]   This man looks and he says, "No, I don't know him." "Of course you do," he says.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.280]   "That's so and so." "Impossible," says the other. "Why?" Well, this other man had always
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   known the man who was passing as a drunkard, an adulterer, a wife-beater, one of the worst
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   men in Thessalonica. But here he is, entirely changed. His very dress is different. His
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:14.880]   face is different. Everything about him is different. And so the other man says, "Well,
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:20.560]   what on earth has happened to him?" "Well, you know," says the first man, "he's been
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.880]   like this ever since a man called Paul came here. You remember what he used to be like.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:30.240]   But you know this man came here, this strange little man with this extraordinary message.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.840]   And this man, once he heard it, he was absolutely different and he's been different ever since.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.520]   He's going now to what they call a prayer meeting. And he seems to be doing this constantly.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.560]   He's a new man. His wife is different. His children are different. His home is different.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.720]   I've never seen such a change in a man in the whole of my life. It's amazing. It's extraordinary."
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:54.240]   "Well, what is this then?" says the other man. And his curiosity is aroused. And then
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.280]   a woman passed. And the first man said to the other, "Do you recognize her?" "No, I
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:05.760]   have no idea who she is." "Dear me," says that so-and-so, mentioning one of the worst
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:12.760]   women in the city, an adulteress, a woman who was never at home, neglected her husband
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:18.320]   and her own children, children in rags, didn't prepare the right food for them, neglected
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   their health. A woman hardly worthy of the name of woman. But there she goes, well-dressed,
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:32.160]   neatly dressed. And she's going to this same meeting, prayer meeting, preaching meeting.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:36.560]   And her home is changed. Her children are different. Her husband is different. Everything
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.360]   is different. This is what was happening. Under the preaching of this gospel, these
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:46.720]   words which had come in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, these people had been
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:52.600]   born again. They were renewed. They were entirely changed. They were saints adorning the Church
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:59.600]   of God. And they had become a phenomenon in Thessalonica. And they were being talked of
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:06.720]   right away through Macedonia, over the mountain ranges, down in Achaia, and through the then
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   civilized world. My dear friends, here is the question with which I leave you this evening.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:22.160]   Are you a phenomenon in this city of Pensacola? Are you an object of wonder to your neighbors
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:30.360]   and associates? It is only when you and I, who are members of the Church, are people
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:36.600]   like this and become phenomena, objects of conversation and of talk and of remark and
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:43.600]   of curiosity, that we shall begin to see revival and renewal in the Church. Oh yes, we shall
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   see the preaching, the Word, the only gospel, the power of the Spirit upon it, but the proof
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:59:00.920]   of its truth in the daily life and living of the members of the Church, people who claim
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:10.400]   to be Christians and who belong to the only true and living God.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:17.640]   My dear friends, let us make certain of the message, but let us pray without ceasing,
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:26.680]   that God shall send down His mighty Spirit of power again upon us who preach and have
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:34.160]   the privilege of preaching, and upon all who listen. Let us pray for true spiritual awakening
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   and revival and do so until God in His infinite kindness and condescension shall be pleased
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:51.880]   to hear us and to open the windows of heaven again and send down such a shower of blessing
[00:59:51.880 --> 01:00:00.600]   that we shall scarce be able to contain it. That is how Christianity spread in the first
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:07.520]   century. That is how it has spread in every other century. It is the only way in which
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.520]   it will spread in this century.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.600]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
