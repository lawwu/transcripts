[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   1) Romans 9 – The chapter Romans 9 has been mentioned almost 300 times in emails.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.520]   Lots of questions about that chapter. Today a question about why Calvinists so often speak
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.240]   of election of believers as unconditional, but the reprobation of the non-elect as conditional.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.600]   Question from Henry, "Dear Pastor John, hello. In Romans 9 10-13 Paul says God loved
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.240]   Jacob and hated Esau before either had done anything good or bad. I've heard many Calvinists
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.840]   say election has nothing to do with works alone, good or bad, present or foreseen. That's
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.400]   true and glorious. However, many of those same Calvinists say that when God predestines
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.720]   people to hell, he ensures that they are deserving of judgment due to their past sins. This sounds
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.040]   contradictory to me. If election is unconditional, why is perdition here so often presented as
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.000]   a conditional response?"
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.440]   Let's put the text, the key text, in front of us and make sure we understand the question
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.660]   in context. Here's what Paul wrote in Romans 9 11-13. "Though Jacob and Esau were not
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.640]   yet born and had done nothing either good or bad." Really important. Really important.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.480]   They had done nothing good or bad. In order that… Now, Paul is explaining why he chooses
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.000]   the way he does. In order that God's purpose of election might continue not because of
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.280]   works but because of… And you might expect him to say because of faith. No. He says not
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.240]   because of works but because of him who calls. Rebecca was told the elder will serve the
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.760]   younger. As it is written, "Jacob I loved, Esau I hated."
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.800]   Now what Paul had said in verse 6, that was verses 11-13, what Paul had said in verse
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.400]   6 was that the promises of God to Israel have not failed, even though many Jewish people
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.320]   are perishing according to verse 3, being accursed and cut off from Christ. And the
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.280]   reason the promises of God to Israel have not failed, even though some are perishing,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.520]   is that "not all Israel is Israel." That is, the saving promises of God do not guarantee
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:49.200]   the salvation of every single ethnic Israelite, but only the true Israel. That's the point
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.080]   of verses 6-8. Not all the descendants of Abraham are the children of God.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.840]   Then Paul shows the deepest root of what makes a person part of the true Israel, the saved
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:15.280]   Israel, and that deepest root is God's unconditional election, meaning God's choice of one person
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:25.240]   and not another, not based on any good deeds or any bad deeds, not based on any good deeds
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.200]   or bad deeds, one person is chosen and not another. Chosen for what? Choice for what?
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.840]   What choice are you talking about? Well, what Paul is dealing with in verse 3 is how can
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.880]   so many individual Israelites be lost, be cursed, and cut off from Christ, verse 3?
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.280]   So the issue is eternal salvation. Paul is burdened by his kinsmen according to the flesh
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:04.000]   who are lost, eternal cursedness. So election here means election of who will be the true
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.680]   Israelites, verse 6, the true children of God, verse 8, and who will not be.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   Now what Henry is pointing out is that the Scriptures—not just Calvinists—the Scriptures
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:28.320]   teach that everyone who is sentenced to eternal condemnation, hell, deserves to be there.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:36.200]   That's biblical teaching. Nobody is in hell because they don't deserve to be there.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.880]   They will be there because of their unbelief and their sin. And Henry is saying this sounds
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.760]   contradictory. Unconditional election on the one hand, conditional damnation on the other
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:02.600]   hand. When God decided not to choose a person, he did not base his decision on foreseen unbelief
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:12.480]   and sin. But when God condemns a person, in the end, it is based on unbelief and sin.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.760]   And Henry wonders if that's a contradiction. And my answer is no, it is not. There are
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.400]   good reasons for why God elects in the beginning in the way he does, and there are good reasons
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.240]   for why God judges in the end the way he does. And these acts of election and condemnation
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.160]   and these reasons are not contradictory. He condemns in the end on the basis of unbelief
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.760]   and sin because he's just. And the principle of justice in the Bible is, Exodus 23, 7,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.920]   do not kill the innocent and righteous. And Proverbs 17, 15, it's an abomination to the
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.340]   Lord to condemn the righteous. And Romans 2, 8, those who do not obey the truth but
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.440]   obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. That's the biblical principle of
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.400]   justice, and God is just. So God's final decision to assign someone to hell will be
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:22.700]   because they deserve it. There will be no injustice. No one will be in hell who does
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:30.960]   not deserve to be there. And no degree of punishment in hell will be out of proportion
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:38.300]   to the greatness of the guilt of the sinner, Luke 12, 47. So God condemns on the basis
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:46.800]   of unbelief and sin because he's just, but he elects before the foundation of the world,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:55.640]   not based on unbelief and sin, because he's free and independent of all external constraints
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.160]   in forming his own plan. Let me say it again. Here's the way Paul puts it. He seems to
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.840]   be laboring to make this clear. Though they were not yet born and had done nothing good
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:15.440]   or bad in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works, good
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:25.760]   or bad, but because of him, his purpose, his will, his counsel, alone, his freedom. She
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.320]   was told the elder will serve the younger. So here's why I think Henry says this sounds
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:39.240]   contradictory, that God condemns on the basis of unbelief and sin, but he elects before
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.160]   the foundation of the world, not based on unbelief and sin. And I think Henry says that
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:55.600]   sounds contradictory because we don't know how God sees to it that all those who are
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:05.080]   not elect do in fact become guilty of condemnation. Let me say that again. We don't know how
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:17.400]   God renders it certain or sees to it that all those who are not elect do in fact become
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:24.800]   guilty of condemnation. How does real guilt become a certainty for all the non-elect?
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.280]   Which is another way of asking, how does a sovereign God govern the heart choices of
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.800]   all human beings, and yet those human beings be accountable for their heart choices? And
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   I am happy to let that be one of the hidden things that belongs to the Lord, Deuteronomy
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:55.360]   29.29. What we do know is this. Both are taught in the Bible. God governs the choices of all
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.760]   people, and all people are accountable for their choices. That's not a contradiction.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.000]   It is a mystery, or it may be a mystery. Some think they may have figured it out. I haven't.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.640]   It may be a mystery. That is, we don't know how—that's the key word—we don't know
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:23.920]   how God does it, but we do know he does it. The king's heart is a stream of water in
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:31.760]   the hand of the Lord, and he turns it wherever he will, Proverbs 21.1, and that king is accountable
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   before God.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.040]   Amen. A divine mystery indeed. Thank you, Pastor John. And we've now surpassed 1,300

[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.680]   Well, why does God withhold good things from his children, from us? It's a perennial question.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.760]   It's older than Psalm 73, and most recently it came to us from a 27-year-old woman who
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.080]   is waiting for marriage. It's a great question, applicable to the not-yet-marrieds, but in
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.600]   principle applicable to all of us. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here
