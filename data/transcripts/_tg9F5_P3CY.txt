[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   - The reason my company has been successful
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.960]   in terms of this is 'cause of an idea meritocratic
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.120]   decision making, a process by which you can get
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.680]   the best ideas, you know, what's an idea meritocracy?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.680]   An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.120]   that are available out there and to work together
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   with other people in the team to achieve that.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.640]   - So if we can linger on a little bit longer,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.000]   the idea of an idea meritocracy, it's fascinating,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.120]   but especially because it seems to be rare,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.020]   not just in companies but in society.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.400]   So there's a lot of people on Twitter and public discourse
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.060]   and politics and so on that are really stuck
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.000]   in certain sets of ideas, whatever they are.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.520]   So when you're confronted with an idea
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.520]   that's different than your own about a particular topic,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.800]   what kind of process do you go through mentally?
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.160]   Are you arguing through the idea with the person?
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.400]   Sort of present it as almost like a debate?
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.060]   Or do you sit on it and consider the world
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.040]   sort of empathetically, if this is true,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.360]   then what does that world look like?
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.480]   Does that world make sense?
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.580]   And so on, so what's the process of considering
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.920]   those conflicting ideas for you?
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880]   - I'm gonna answer that question after saying first,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.880]   almost implicit in your question is it's not common, okay?
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.120]   What's common produces only common results, okay?
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.160]   So don't judge anything that is good
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.680]   based on whether it's common,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   'cause it's only gonna give you common results.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.240]   If you want unique, you have a unique approach, okay?
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.520]   And so that art of thoughtful disagreement
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.200]   is the capacity to hold two things in your mind
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.640]   at the same time.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.800]   The gee, I think this makes sense,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.440]   and then saying I'm not sure it makes sense,
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.680]   and then try to say why does it make sense,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.240]   and then to triangulate with others.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.560]   So if I'm having a discussion like that
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.640]   and I work myself through and I'm not sure,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.320]   then I have to do that in a good way.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   So I always give attention, for example,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.460]   let's start off what does the other person know
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.220]   relative to what I know?
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.940]   So if a person has a higher expertise or things,
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.340]   I'm much more inclined to ask questions.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.940]   I'm always asking questions.
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.740]   If you wanna learn, you're asking questions
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.580]   you're not arguing, okay?
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.940]   You're taking in, you're assessing when it comes into you.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.100]   Does that make sense?
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.180]   Are you learning something?
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.100]   Are you getting epiphanies and so on?
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.660]   And I try to then do that.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.660]   If the conversation, as we're trying to decide what is true,
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.660]   and we're trying to do that together,
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.300]   and we see truth different,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.420]   then I might even call in another really smart,
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.420]   capable person and try to say what is true
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.540]   and how do we explore that together?
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.740]   And you go through that same thing.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.700]   So I would, I said, I describe it as having open-mindedness
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.100]   and assertiveness at the same time.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.700]   That you can simultaneously be open-minded
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.820]   and take in with that curiosity,
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.720]   and then also be assertive and say,
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.940]   but that doesn't make sense.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.740]   Why would this be the case?
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.580]   And you do that back and forth.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.740]   (silence)
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.900]   (silence)
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.060]   (silence)
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.220]   (silence)
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.380]   (silence)
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.540]   (silence)
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.700]   (silence)
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
