[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Alright, Pastor John, you left us hanging last time because there's a debate happening in the church recently
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   about how much of the Christian life is grace and how much of it is obedience,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   or how does gospel-centeredness and justification work together in the Christian life?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Oh, how I would love for the lovers of sovereign grace to be of one mind
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   about how sovereign grace works in the process of sanctification,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   how grace relates to obedience, the process of our attitudes and actions becoming more holy by the grace of God.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   1 Peter 1:15 says, "As he who called you is holy, be holy in all your conduct."
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   So there are controversies out there about the process of sanctification
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and the role of obedience and effort in it, the role of grace and Christ's cross and justification in it.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And I want to try to come at this in a way that maybe could bring these sides together.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   All of us want to exalt grace. Grace is our only hope. None of us deserves heaven. We all deserve hell.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Only grace will keep us out of hell, and that grace flows to us from God through Jesus Christ,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   only through Jesus Christ, who absorbed the curse and the wrath of God and who provided righteousness for us
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and enabled us to be forgiven so that God could be 100% for us.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   All of us have in mind those glorious truths when we think about grace,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and we all agree, the people I'm thinking about anyway would.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   The debate is usually formulated in terms of whether human effort is needed to attain the holiness or the obedience
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   without which we will not see the Lord. And what I don't see emphasized enough,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and I think it would help if we did, what I don't see emphasized enough in the debate,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   though I could have missed it, is a strong biblical emphasis on future grace.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   That is the kind of grace that shows up this afternoon or tomorrow morning.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It's new every morning, Lamentations says, and it empowers faith-filled effort that we make
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   in the things that we ought to do. This future grace is blood-bought grace.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   There's the link with the cross and with justification. The only reason God is gracious to me this afternoon
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   is because Christ died for me in the past. And so it always, depending on this future grace,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   always glorifies the Jesus of the cross, the blood-shedding Jesus.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So let me illustrate how this works from a few texts.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And one text in particular is very, very key, and I'd just love to get everybody in the same room
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and see how they would handle this text. The point I'm making here is that living by grace
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   and making effort in the Bible, those two things, living by grace and making effort with my own mind
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and will, are in the Bible not exclusive categories. Those aren't either-ors.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You don't say, "I'll either live by grace or I'll either make an effort."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   If the effort is what the Bible calls a "work of faith," so watch this happen in 2 Thessalonians 1, verses 11 and 12.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   In fact, I'd say this to people, click stop right now on the episode and go get your Bible and open it up
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   and I'll wait for you. Okay, good. Are you back? Good. Here we go.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   We always pray for you. This is 2 Thessalonians 1, 11.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   We always pray for you that our God may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by His power
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   so that the name of Jesus, the Lord Jesus, will be glorified in you according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Now that's a massively important verse on the relationship between my resolving and my working
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and God's grace and God's power and my faith.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So here are the eight pieces, here are the eight steps of sanctification in that verse.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I'll just tick them off here. Number one, God.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   We always pray for you that our God may fulfill in you.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So everything starts with God. Number two, God's grace.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The resolve for good, every work of faith are according to the grace of our God.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Now that's future grace. So this afternoon, I'm supposed to resolve some good, do some work of faith.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   There's going to be grace there to help me make it happen.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Number three, God's power. God fulfills every resolve for good, every work of faith by His power.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So this grace is experienced as a power from God.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Number four, our faith. This God-fulfilled activity is a work of faith.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That's the phrase in the Bible, work of faith.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So the way God, by His grace and His power, is going to bring about the good work, the obedience, the holiness,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   is by faith in that grace, which is His power to do it.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Number five, our resolve. May God fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   This means that there's an inner motion of the soul to embrace the good that's about to be done.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   The soul moves. It's an act of the will. I'm resolving something.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   This is a human act. Human act.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But God is the one who, by His grace, by His power, through our faith, is bringing it to pass.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Those are the dynamics that keep it from being legalism.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Number six, our work. May God fulfill every good resolve, every resolve for good, and work of faith by His power.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So this is our work in the sense that our mind, our will, our hands are the actors of the deed.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But the decisive cause is God. God's grace, God's power flowing through our faith and our resolve.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   So 1 Corinthians 15.10 is just a great illustration of this.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "By the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   On the contrary, I worked, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It's exactly the same as here in 2 Thessalonians 1.11.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Number seven, the resolve is fulfilled. That's the seventh piece, fulfilled.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   The work is done. May God fulfill every good resolve and work of faith.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   So when the work is done, we know God has done it.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   He awakened my resolve. He gave the gift of faith. His grace and His power carried the work.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And so when it's done, He fulfilled it, which is what it says in Philippians 2.12.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God, your working, is really God's working.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   He's the one that's bringing it to completion through the resolving and the willing and the working and the faith and the power and the grace.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So it's your acting in His decisive doing.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Number eight, this is the last one. Jesus is glorified.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   May God fulfill every resolve for good, every work of faith by His power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified in you.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So it's all going to glorify Jesus because He's the one who bought all of this grace for us.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So, by His grace and for His glory, and in the middle, human resolve, human work, and the link between this blood-bought power and grace that carries all this human action is my faith, my trust in Him.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   So that in the end, the work of holiness, the work of holiness is a work of faith and a work of grace.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It is visibly and heartily our doing, and it is ultimately and decisively God's doing.
