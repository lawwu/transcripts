[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   I was delighted to find this email question in the inbox because I don't think anyone has asked it before.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.640]   I may be wrong. Maybe I missed it. But today's question comes from a podcast listener named Sue.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.640]   Hello, Pastor John. Thank you for this podcast. My question is, what is your favorite hymn and why is it your favorite?
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.760]   Well, I love to sing.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.840]   And especially with God's people.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.480]   On the Lord's Day, gathered for worship in an atmosphere of serious joy and carried along by
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.040]   the Holy Spirit with well-expressed truth about the greatness and the beauty and excellence of
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.160]   all that God is for us in Christ. I believe that when this comes from the heart of hundreds of
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.800]   people or dozens of people or thousands of people, when it comes from the heart of a united, humble,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:09.520]   holiness-pursuing, justice-pursuing, love-pursuing people, God delights in this sound with all His heart.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:21.360]   During my 33 years of pastoring Bethlehem Baptist Church, many of the highest and the sweetest
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:33.120]   moments of my life were spent standing at the front pew singing with all my heart as the crescendo
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:43.760]   of the people's praise broke over my head from behind like a wave of joy and hope. God ministered
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:52.160]   to me in those moments, ministered to my marriage in those moments, ministered to my relationships
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:02.000]   more deeply at those times, I believe, than any other time I'm aware of. That's saying a lot,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.800]   and I'm saying it carefully. Things happened spiritually in my heart that kept me in the
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.400]   ministry, kept me in marriage, kept me fathering, kept me in friendships. Things happened spiritually
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.840]   in my heart concerning my relation to God and to my wife and other people, the ripple effects of
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.200]   which I will never fully know until heaven. But they were profound, and on many Sundays, they were
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:49.440]   deeply needed. So I do not take corporate singing of hymns in worship to Christ lightly, and I do not
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.360]   take the words of songs lightly, or the suitableness of the tunes to fit the words lightly,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.160]   or the blood earnestness and the vertical radicalness of the atmosphere of the service
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.240]   as the people go hard after God, or the spiritual demeanor of the leaders who can be wonderfully
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.040]   helpful or very distracting, or the preciousness of the fellowship in song. I can remember—here's
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.800]   an element of the horizontal nature of vertical focus—I can remember moments when my heart was
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.240]   flat and next to me was a precious comrade in ministry. I'm remembering, for example,
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.240]   Tom Stellar in particular, who served with me all my ministry and still serving.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:51.040]   Here he stands with his eyes closed and his hands lifted high in praise while I'm feeling flat,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:04.080]   and oh, how this regularly, profoundly ministered to me, stirred me, awakened me, rebuked me,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   drew me up to God. There's a dimension to the horizontal reality of radically vertical worship
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:23.280]   that is incomparable. And then there's nothing like the act of preaching, expository exaltation—in
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.600]   other words, preaching is worship—preaching, coming on the wings of such praises. Preaching
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   to a people in that kind of God-saturated hour is a wonderful thing. There's just nothing like it.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:49.520]   So instead of my favorite hymn, since I don't know what it is, I will mention one of my favorites.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:58.960]   What qualifies a hymn to be in this group is the mingling of sorrow and joy—these are my criteria
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.800]   for what's in my favorite group—the mingling of sorrow and joy, brokenness and hope, divine
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:16.480]   tenderness and sovereign majesty, exalted focus and intimate personal expression, beautiful poetry,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.680]   a tune that fits all those things in both seriousness of emotion and exaltation of hope.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   And I think I would put into that category, "It is well with my soul, a mighty fortress,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.440]   oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus, come thou fount, my song is love unknown, and can it be,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.480]   crowned with many crowns, be thou my vision?" And the list, frankly, would get very long if I kept
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.720]   going. There are many stunningly powerful and great hymns that accomplish all those things for
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.640]   me. But the one that I want to mention is "If thou but suffer God to guide thee," which you've
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:04.320]   probably never heard of. "If thou but suffer God to guide thee." And here's the catch. This is a
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:14.640]   translation of the German hymn by Georg Neumark, 1641, "Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten."
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:23.840]   And it has seven verses in the original, and no modern English hymnal that I'm aware of has all
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:34.960]   seven verses. Some have tried to modernize the song and give it—it's awful, it's awful what they do
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   to Catherine Winkworth's translation, and yet they think they can do better with the German than her
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.640]   when they didn't even know German. But let me give you a flavor of Georg Neumark's own tune,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:57.600]   because he wrote the tune and he wrote the words. It's in a minor key, which is where I think songs
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:08.080]   of this content need to be. And when sung robustly, which minor songs can be sung by a congregation
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:18.080]   that sees and loves this truth, it has a bulwark-like effect of strength and hope.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   [singing]
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   That's the way it sounds. And I love the hymn because of all the reasons given above,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.280]   and because I discovered it when I was living in Germany, and it became—this
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.120]   is why it's so near the top—it became, along with "God Moves in a Mysterious Way,"
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:12.880]   the weapon of hope in those difficult years. I love it because the words express
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:21.040]   hope in the worst of times because of an absolutely sovereign and merciful God.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.560]   So I'm going to read it and then be done. So I'll just read the English so that you can get
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:34.400]   the flavor. I could never find the translation of verse 5, so I translated verse 5 in this 7,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:42.800]   because I have the 7 German right here in front of me on page 298 of my German songbook.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.000]   "If thou but suffer God to guide thee, And hope in him through all thy ways,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.040]   He'll give thee strength whate'er betide thee, And bear thee through the evil days.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.600]   Who trusts in God's unchanging love, Builds on a rock that naught can move?
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:07.920]   What can these anxious cares avail thee, These never-ceasing moans and sighs?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.480]   What can it help if thou bewail thee, Or each dark moment as it flies?
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.640]   Our cross and trials do but press The heavier for our bitterness.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:28.560]   Only be still and wait his leisure, In cheerful hope with heart content,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.760]   To take whate'er thy Father's pleasure And his discerning love has sent.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.960]   Nor doubt our inmost wants are known To him who chose us for his own.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.480]   He knows the time for joy, And truly will send it when he sees it meet,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.920]   When he has tried and purged thee duly, And finds thee free from all deceit.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.560]   He comes to thee all unaware, And makes thee own his loving care.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.680]   Think not that God has thee forsaken, When sorrow crowns your acts of care,
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.120]   Nor that he sleeps and cannot waken, While evil prospers everywhere.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:18.880]   Each recompense will have its hour; God sets the times with love and power.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:28.000]   All are alike before the highest. 'Tis easy to our God we know to raise thee up,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.560]   Though low thou liest to make the rich man poor and low.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:39.760]   True wonders still by him are wrought, Who setteth up and brings to naught.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.920]   Sing, pray, and keep his ways unswerving; So do thine own part faithfully,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:55.120]   And trust his word, though undeserving. Thou yet shalt find it true for thee,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:04.480]   God never yet forsook at need the soul that trusted him indeed. Amen.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.640]   Amen. That's beautiful. What a great find, Pastor John. Thanks for sharing it with us on the podcast.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.800]   And thank you, Sue, for that great question. Of course, we celebrate Christmas coming up
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.520]   on Sunday and bound up with the Christmas narrative are a lot of beautiful hymns to sing.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.360]   But the story of Christ's birth brings with it a reminder of his whole life and all of his works.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.440]   And that means it is also a season for us to reflect on his sacrifice. And on Friday,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.320]   we will do that very thing as we look at the theme of sacrifice throughout the Bible
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.000]   and to see once again just how this major theme in God's grand storyline is fulfilled
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.160]   in the person of Jesus Christ. Until then, you can find our audio feeds in our episode archive,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.440]   and you can reach our inbox all through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
