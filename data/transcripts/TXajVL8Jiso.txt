[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.460]   - Today's clip comes not from a sermon,
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.620]   but from an interview with John Piper,
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.420]   and it's an interview that was led by Pastor Norm Funk
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.500]   at Westside Church in Vancouver, British Columbia.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.780]   We jump into their conversation
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.020]   as they were just talking about the local church
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.340]   and leaders who have failed in the local church.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.540]   So what do you say to someone who says,
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.220]   "I'll never leave Jesus,
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.560]   "but I've seen the failure of a pastor,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.680]   "and I'm done with the local church."
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.780]   Here's a very short clip from that conversation.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.460]   - Specific to that, they go,
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.180]   "Pastor John, I'm not walking away from Jesus,
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.740]   "but I'm done with the church.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.640]   "Can't trust the leadership,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.580]   "held this guy in high esteem,
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.340]   "so I'm not gonna walk away from Jesus,
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.020]   "but I'm done with the organized aspect of church life."
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.260]   - If you do that, you're walking away from Jesus.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.300]   Here's the reason.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.100]   To say that I love Jesus,
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.100]   but I don't submit to his word is a lie.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.380]   He who loves me will keep my words.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.340]   Jesus founded the church.
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.580]   I didn't.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.420]   Paul didn't.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.900]   Jesus founded the church.
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.540]   He established apostles to be, according to Ephesians 2.20,
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.660]   the foundation of the church.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.660]   And then he built it with prophets and teachers and pastors
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.820]   and ordained that there be a structure of local churches
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.380]   in the body of Christ called the church.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.820]   This is not man's idea.
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.780]   There are a lot of young evangelicals
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.700]   who are cool, hip, and leftward-leaning
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.180]   who think they can substitute organized,
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.340]   substitute something for organized church.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.660]   Well, I would have to look at what they're substituting
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.580]   and say, "Well, really, are you just creating church?"
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.060]   Trying to create church.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.300]   If you're trying to create church, just create it biblically.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.260]   Start a biblical church.
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.780]   And that means listening to your master
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.260]   and his word and his apostles.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.260]   So the choice of Jesus over church
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.380]   implies a choice of your opinion over the Bible
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.980]   because the Bible is where we meet Jesus.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.260]   You can't make Jesus up.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.420]   You can't make him up.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.860]   He is the Jesus of the Bible
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220]   or he's the Jesus of your imagination.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.020]   If he's the Jesus of the Bible, you take the whole Jesus.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.460]   You can't carve him up in pieces.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.580]   And the whole Jesus is the Jesus who loves the church.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.300]   He died for the church.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.180]   Hard to say it much more clearly than that.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.660]   This short clip was sent in to us by Michael Bailey,
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.740]   a podcast listener.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.900]   Thank you, Michael, for the clip.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900]   It's taken from a recent video
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.660]   which we added to our YouTube channel titled
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.860]   Reflections on Mark Driscoll and the Church.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.060]   You can check it out online.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.380]   Well, what is the sin of gluttony?
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.020]   And what are some signs in which food
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.460]   has become an idol in our lives?
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.700]   That's the question I will serve up on the table
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.660]   tomorrow to Pastor John.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.220]   And yes, that is a bad pun.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.420]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
