[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Now most of you will remember that we are dealing with the early part of the fourteenth
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.360]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, where the apostle is dealing with our attitude
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.000]   as Christians to matters that can be described as matters indifferent.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.400]   Now let me read to you from verse five to the end of verse nine.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.440]   One man esteemeth one day above another, another esteemeth every day alike.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.520]   Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.280]   He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.640]   to the Lord he doth not regard it.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.760]   He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.000]   to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.400]   For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.360]   For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.840]   Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.960]   For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived, that he might be Lord both of
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.320]   the dead and living.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.680]   Now you remember that in opening up this matter the apostle has laid down a general
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.840]   principle in the first verse, that him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840]   doubtful disputations.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.320]   We are not to confuse him, we are not merely to show our cleverness, we are not simply
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.000]   to put him into difficulties.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.400]   And then he takes the first case of this question of eating particular meats, and we have dealt
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.720]   with that, and seen how the apostle tells them to conduct themselves in that respect.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.560]   Then he takes up this second illustration and example, one man esteemeth one day above
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.440]   another, another esteemeth every day alike.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.240]   Now we were dealing with that last Friday night, and we saw that the apostle really
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.840]   is dealing there with these special days that the Jews had observed, festival days and fast
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.480]   days and so on, and certain other special days.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.120]   And having opened up the statement of the case, we began to consider what the apostle
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   teaches as to what we should do with respect to this.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.600]   And what applies to the day applies also of course to the question of meats.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   The same principles are operating in both cases.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.840]   He just takes two illustrations, two of the commonest causes of trouble and confusion
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.360]   in the churches as the result of this new position in which they were as Christians.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.120]   Well now his first answer, you remember, was this.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.080]   Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.320]   Don't be mechanical over this matter.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.720]   Know what you're doing.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.640]   Have reasons for what you do.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.880]   Don't allow people to impose forms upon you.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.760]   But have an intelligent understanding.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.640]   Let every man be persuaded in his own mind.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   Listen to your conscience.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.880]   Recognise it needs to be enlightened, but always listen to it and never act against
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   it.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   Now that's his first answer.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.000]   But he's got a second answer, and it's to this we come this evening.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.400]   And this second answer is to be found here in this sixth verse.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.760]   He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.920]   to the Lord he doth not regard it.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.760]   He that eateth, eateth unto the Lord; for he giveth God thanks.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.080]   And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.040]   Now some of you may have versions and translations other than this authorised version which I
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.400]   have here, and you may notice a variation.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.720]   I've read, he that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.960]   the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.240]   Now that second statement is absent in some of your translations and versions.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.760]   There's only one reason for that, and that is that some of the best manuscripts don't
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.320]   have in them that negative.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.800]   It doesn't make any difference, of course, to the meaning and to the sense.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.320]   Now this is purely a question of textual criticism.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.520]   As Christians we must recognise textual criticism.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.160]   That's a very different thing from higher criticism.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.240]   We don't recognise higher criticism, because that is simply the introduction of men's
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.720]   mind and opinion and philosophy.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   Men deciding whether a thing is there or not, because he doesn't agree with it.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.080]   But textual criticism is another matter.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.560]   And we do know that there were many early texts of the New Testament, and I'm just
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   reminding you, should you have one of the versions or translations that doesn't contain
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.520]   this negative, that that is why it's not there.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.880]   But the meaning, as I say, is exactly the same.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.520]   So the important thing is to grasp the apostle's principle of teaching here, and it is this.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.560]   We must not only be clear in our own minds and satisfied and know what we are doing,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:25.840]   he has a higher motive to put before us for toleration and understanding in this matter.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:34.240]   And that is the relationship of both these subjects to the Lord.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.280]   Now you see he's raising it up to the highest level.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.280]   The spirit in which we decide one way or the other is in a sense even more important than
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.120]   the decision itself.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.720]   So what he's saying here is this.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.880]   You mustn't decide this solely in intellectual terms, you start with it, but you don't
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.600]   stop with it.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.760]   You mustn't do it coldly and objectively.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.160]   That's something we always need to be reminded of as Christians.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.640]   The devil always tempts us to become academic or theoretical or coldly objective.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.960]   It's one of the greatest dangers confronting any Christian and particularly the more intelligent
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   Christians.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.240]   You see it's the old danger again.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.520]   One can do it with regard to theology and doctrine.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.000]   You can be interested in it in a purely theoretical manner and almost forget that you're dealing
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.560]   with God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit and these great doctrines of salvation.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.240]   You can be handling them as if you were studying science or any other secular subject.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.360]   It's a terrible thing.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.640]   We must never forget the spirit.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.280]   And that applies equally in a matter like this.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.800]   Be persuaded in your own mind.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.280]   Think it out, reason it out, if you like discuss it together, but don't do it in a detached
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.920]   theoretical manner.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.480]   The spirit is all important.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.200]   It mustn't be done coldly.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:05.080]   He said above everything else this must be your controlling consideration that you are
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:13.480]   doing it and doing everything for the glory of the Lord and with a desire to please him.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.320]   You notice how he keeps on repeating it.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.360]   He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord and even leaving out the negative.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.280]   He goes on, he that eateth, eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.400]   eateth not to the Lord, he eateth not and giveth God thanks.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.680]   He repeats in order to give it emphasis and to bring it out very, very clearly.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.760]   Now take this word regard which is an important one.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.200]   He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.640]   It's very similar to the word esteemeth which we've already been looking at in verse
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.640]   5.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.720]   It means, if you like, minding.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   That means thinking about.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.360]   That means understanding.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.440]   You know that's the same word exactly as the apostle had used in the eighth chapter
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.160]   in verses 5 and 6.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.720]   They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.640]   the spirit, the things of the spirit.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:25.480]   For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.600]   It's exactly the same word.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.040]   It means, you see, your way of thinking and the results of your way of thinking.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:43.240]   So there are some, he says, who regard certain days as being more important than others.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.760]   The thing we were dealing with in verse 5 and the others do not do that.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.120]   But he says the point is that in both cases they are governed by their consideration that
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:03.320]   they belong to the Lord and they are concerned about pleasing him and doing what is right
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   in his sight.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.920]   Now I read that portion out of the tenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians at
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.480]   the beginning because the apostle there is really saying exactly the same thing.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.720]   It's the same principle.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   Whatsoever ye do, he says, whatsoever ye eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.000]   glory of the Lord.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That's the principle.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.200]   This is the same thing exactly that he's saying here in this fourteenth chapter of
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.520]   the epistle to the Romans.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.840]   In other words, he now is bringing out his ultimate argument in this matter and the most
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.040]   important one.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.720]   We mustn't be primarily concerned about our own liberty.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   We've got liberty.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:56.920]   There is a liberty wherewith Christ hath set us free and this is a most important matter.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.080]   But as you notice from the beginning of this chapter, he has not been coming down as it
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.920]   were on one side or the other.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:11.080]   And here he is telling us negatively not to be concerned only about our liberty or our
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:21.720]   views or our arguments or anything else indeed, but primarily and above all the glory of the
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   Lord.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:30.680]   He says, the men that regardeth the day, he says, recognize that he regards it unto the
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   Lord.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.720]   And if you are satisfied that he does that, well then you must be very careful as to how
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.280]   you handle it.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   If you come to the conclusion that he's only opinionated, well then you handle him in a
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.580]   different way.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:50.640]   But if you do see clearly that the man is really concerned about glorifying the Lord
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.520]   and honoring him and giving a demonstration of what it means to be a Christian for the
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.960]   Lord's sake, well then, says Paul, though you don't agree with him, recognize the rightness
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.360]   of his motive.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.480]   Recognize that he's not doing it just to assert himself or his own opinions and ideas.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.080]   If he is really concerned about the glory of the Lord, well now then, you be very careful
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.040]   what you do with respect to him.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:26.480]   He says, as long as this is true on both sides, each one of you is concerned with this rather
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.440]   than with yourselves and your own liberty and ideas, well then, he says, you must get
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.080]   on together and you will learn to help one another and to discuss it in a Christian way
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.000]   together in order that ultimately you may arrive at a common opinion.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.800]   And then of course he elaborates it further by bringing back again this question of meets.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.960]   It's the same point.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:54.040]   He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:01.200]   In other words, here is a man who is eating meats that have been offered to idols, but
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.040]   he as a Christian now sees that there's nothing in this, that the idols are not gods, there's
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.400]   nothing there at all, pure figment of men's imagination.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.920]   So this man in his liberty, he eats these meats.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.680]   But says Paul, watch him and see what he does.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.320]   Does he give God thanks for this meat?
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.600]   If he does, you've got very good presumptive evidence that he is eating to the glory of
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   God.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.120]   But his motive again is to show the liberty wherewith Christ has set him free.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.480]   He says he's giving proof of it because he is giving God thanks for this meat which he
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480]   is eating.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.200]   And this again is to be something to which you pay very close attention, and it is to
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.320]   influence you in your judgment concerning this man.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.000]   Now, he's really addressing here the weaker brother at this point.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.240]   He says, don't you judge him, don't you condemn him.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.800]   Look at him, he's giving God thanks.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.560]   So he is clearly eating this meat to the glory of God.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.640]   Otherwise he wouldn't thank him for it.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.200]   Now in other words, you see, the principle that comes in here again is that the way in
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.800]   which we do these things is even more important than the thing itself.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.380]   That's the thing to look for.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:29.640]   We must be concerned with our brother's motive, his idea, what he is doing and his reason
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   for doing it.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:37.440]   Then he takes up the other men and he says that he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.040]   not and giveth God thanks.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.400]   Now what he means by the man who eateth not is not a man who is on a permanent fast, obviously,
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.080]   or he wouldn't be alive for very long.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.280]   He means by the man who eateth not, the man who doesn't eat these particular meats.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.320]   That's the thing he's been talking about from the very beginning.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:04.280]   The two types of men, the stronger ones who eat these meats, which were prohibited to
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.360]   the Jews and the meats that had been offered to idols amongst the pagans, that's the man
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   who eats.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.840]   The man who doesn't eat is the man who doesn't eat that sort, but he eats herbs in the way
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.160]   that we've already seen.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.880]   So the eateth not is a reference to the men who doesn't eat these meats, the men who eats
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   herbs.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.740]   And of course the same applies and giveth God thanks.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:33.840]   Some people have misunderstood all this and they think that it means that he gives God
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.000]   thanks for what he doesn't eat, or that he thanks God for the fact that he doesn't eat.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.280]   Of course people are capable of doing that sort of thing.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.080]   They interpret it in other words in this way, that the weaker brother is saying, "I thank
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.800]   God that I'm not like that other fellow who is eating those meats prohibited to Jews,
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.960]   or I thank God that I'm not like that other man who is eating meats that have been offered
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   to idols."
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   That's quite wrong.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.760]   It would be quite foreign to the whole argument of this passage, and in any case it would
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.240]   be sure fair he says, "What he means is this.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.320]   This man gives God thanks for the herbs which he eats."
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.120]   That's what it means.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:18.320]   He that eateth not the meats to the Lord, and for the Lord's sake he doesn't eat meats,
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.120]   and he gives God thanks for what he does eat, namely for the herbs.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.840]   So you see you've got an exact parallel.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:31.120]   Here are these two Christians in the same church, disagreeing about these matters.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.080]   But you notice the things that are common to them.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.000]   They both are concerned with showing the glory of the Lord.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   They're both anxious to behave as Christians.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   They're both doing it to the Lord, for the Lord's sake, and they both are giving God
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.600]   thanks in exactly the same way.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.000]   One for meats, one for herbs.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.920]   Now then, this is the apostle's argument you see, that they mustn't divide on this.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.760]   The stronger brother mustn't despise the weaker, and the weaker mustn't judge the stronger.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:10.160]   Because much more important than the question of meats and herbs is that they both are concerned
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.760]   to serve the same Lord, the same Master.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.360]   They both are equally conscious of the fact that God is the giver of every good and every
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.960]   perfect gift, and that meat and herbs come ultimately from God.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:34.520]   Now that is, you see, just another way of saying that obviously this question is one
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.840]   that deals with things which are not essential.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:44.640]   They both belong to the category of things indifferent.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.840]   You see, if they were essential, both parties could not possibly be doing it to the glory
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.680]   of the Lord and giving him thanks.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.800]   But by showing that they do this, he's bringing in a further argument.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:04.640]   He says, can't you see, this cannot be as important as you are tending to regard it.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   Because the really big and important thing is loyalty to the Lord, concern about keeping
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.240]   his commandments, concern about manifesting his glory and his praise, and a spirit which
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.600]   in humility and thankfulness is offering praise to him.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:27.680]   Now, says Paul, hold on to that and see therefore that you've been exaggerating the importance
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.720]   of these meats and these days.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:40.360]   So he sums up by saying that as long as we are animated by these twin motives of ministering
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:49.880]   to the glory of God and offering him thanks, we cannot be going wrong in any serious way
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   or manner.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   Very well.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:59.880]   Now, that is the argument as you've got it up to the end of the sixth verse.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:06.920]   But the apostle, as here, said something which he feels is so important that he's got to
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.760]   take it up and elaborate it and open it up and emphasize it.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:21.560]   Because he says, what I've just been saying is part of a larger principle, it is a part
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.200]   of a still bigger truth.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.800]   And in verses seven to nine, he opens up this larger, this bigger truth.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.840]   You see, here's the connection.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.120]   The word 'for', of course, reminds us at once that it does follow from what he's just been
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.120]   saying.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.280]   The big thing he's been saying in the previous verse, verse six, is this.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.960]   It is to the Lord.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   It is to God.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.720]   Very well, he says.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.960]   Now, that is true about eating meats, about eating herbs.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.880]   But he says, you know, this is true about the whole of our lives.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.240]   None of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.280]   For whether we live, we live unto the Lord.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.920]   And whether we die, we die unto the Lord.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.480]   Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.480]   You see what he's doing?
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.520]   He has started with particulars.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.520]   But he rises from the level of the particular to the general.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.280]   And now he's going to show that this is true in the general realm as well.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.760]   And if it is therefore true in the general, well then, how much more so must it of necessity
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.720]   be true in the realm of the particular?
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.600]   So he's not forsaking his argument.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.160]   He's just underlining it, as it were, and showing why this, which he's been teaching
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.000]   in verses five and six, must of necessity be the truth.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.200]   But, you see, at this point and in this way, he is introducing us to one of the most important
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.680]   things we can ever learn as Christian people.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   What is it?
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.360]   Well, let's take the seventh verse first.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.760]   Here we've got a negative statement.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:09.200]   None of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.600]   What does this mean?
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.080]   None of us means not one of us.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.720]   Not one of us, he says, lives to himself.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.880]   Not one of us dies when he dies to himself.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.960]   But what is this statement?
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   What does it mean?
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.000]   Now, here again, people tend to go astray.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.240]   Some think that this is just a general statement of the truth that anything that any one of
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.800]   us does in this life is bound to affect other people.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.480]   That man is a gregarious animal, or, if you like, that there is the principle of the solidarity
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.880]   of the human race.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.520]   That no man can act in isolation.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.840]   What any one of us does, of necessity, affects other people.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:07.280]   Now, there are people who think that he just meant that, that we can't divorce ourselves
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.200]   or detach ourselves from the rest of humanity or from society.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.800]   It's no use my going off into a corner and say, "Well, now, this is what I want to do,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.500]   and this is what I believe I should do, and after all, it doesn't concern anybody else.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.600]   This is what I want to do."
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.320]   You can't do that, because whatever you do is bound to affect other people.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.960]   Now, but that is not what the apostle is saying.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:33.760]   That's not the point that he's concerned to say at all, and I can easily prove that to
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.760]   you.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.840]   I can prove to you that it's not a general statement in this way, that when we come to
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:45.200]   the positive aspect of this same statement, he says it is all in terms of living unto
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.960]   the Lord.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.560]   That we don't live to ourselves because we live to the Lord.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.240]   Well, now then, it is not just, therefore, a general statement.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.480]   It wouldn't help the apostle to say that.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   It isn't the thing he is setting out to prove.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:05.680]   He is now working out what he said in verse 6, and the thing in verse 6 is our relationship
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.000]   to the Lord.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.640]   So this seventh verse is a negative statement which he puts in terms of our relationship
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   to the Lord.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:22.080]   And in any case, what the apostle is dealing with here doesn't refer to the whole of humanity.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.760]   He's not writing about an unbeliever at all.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.740]   The whole discussion from the very beginning of the first verse is only about Christian
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.740]   people.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:36.000]   A non-believer, an unbeliever, a non-Christian, he's not concerned about these points.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   He's not interested.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.880]   He doesn't know what the apostle is talking about.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   He's not dealing with him.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.000]   So it's not a general, universal statement.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.440]   Of course it is true, incidentally.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.920]   That universal statement is true.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.440]   But the fact that it is true doesn't mean that that is what Paul was saying.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   He is saying something which is much more particular.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:06.040]   Neither does it mean just to say that all men's lives and deaths are in the hands of
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.160]   the Lord.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.920]   No man liveth unto himself, no man dieth unto himself.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.520]   As if he were saying, well, you know, whether you like it or not, we are all in the hands
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.260]   of the Lord.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.920]   It doesn't mean that, again, for exactly the same reason.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.560]   That is true of all people, unbelievers as well as believers.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:34.400]   Whereas the apostle is only concerned here to deal with believers, amongst whom alone
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.480]   this problem arises.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.840]   So what does it mean?
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.400]   Well, you see, what it means is this.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:51.160]   No Christian, no one of us, none of us, you see, Christians, not one of us should serve
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   his own ends in life.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.280]   No one of us asserts his own will.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.960]   That isn't the motive of the Christian.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:12.100]   The Christian is always governed by his relationship to the Lord.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.720]   So we can, if you like, put it like this.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:22.920]   No Christian lives or dies, one, for his own benefit or for his own pleasure.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.640]   That's what he's saying.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:31.920]   When he says no man liveth unto himself, no Christian should live for his own pleasure
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.140]   or his own benefit.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.680]   No Christian should live according to his own will, his own understanding, or his own
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.960]   inclination.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:48.640]   No Christian, in exactly the same way, should die for his own benefit or his own pleasure.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.840]   No Christian should die according to his own will or his own understanding or his own inclination.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:03.440]   Now this is, I say, where this principle becomes, of course, such a tremendously important one.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.320]   This is fundamental to Christian living.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.280]   The trouble with us so often is that we get so immersed in details that we forget the
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.680]   biggest principle of all.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:20.320]   And the biggest principle of all is that we are to live entirely to his glory and to his
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.280]   praise, not for ourselves.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.520]   And this governs the whole of our life.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:34.320]   And he finds out that it is also to govern our dying.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.640]   And perhaps we are still more likely or more liable to forget this second aspect even than
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.440]   the first aspect.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.360]   People in general are prepared to say, well, of course, my life should be in the hands
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   of God.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   You surrender your life to him.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.240]   You don't just live to please yourself.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.160]   You don't just live to satisfy your own ideas or to carry out your own ideas.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.760]   Obviously, one of the basic differences between the Christian and the non-Christian is that
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   the Christian doesn't do that.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.080]   That's how everybody else lives.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.600]   Every other person, all non-Christians, are all living to please themselves.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.080]   And they live according to their own ideas and their own theories and so on.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.840]   But the first thing that is true of the Christian is that he ceases to do that.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.240]   He now lives to the Lord.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:29.200]   He doesn't, the negative is the one that he emphasizes in verse 7, he does not live to
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.480]   himself, of himself, for himself, and by himself.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.320]   And he says exactly the same thing is true of our dying.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:49.720]   Now, here is something I'm sure that we find we don't often think about.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:56.080]   We as Christians do not decide when we die.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:02.400]   We shouldn't want to decide when we die, or how we die, or where we die.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.160]   That's what he's saying.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.000]   A Christian doesn't do that, he says.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.920]   None of us dieth to himself.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   He's not in control.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.400]   He's not in charge.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:18.360]   That is why suicide to a Christian should always be unthinkable.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.280]   And for this reason, not because the thing itself is wrong so much, as that it means
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.960]   that the Christian himself is taking the decision.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.440]   The suicide is a man who decides to put an end to his life.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.480]   Paul is saying here, a Christian doesn't do that.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.600]   A Christian does not die to himself.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.440]   He doesn't take the decision or determine this matter.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:46.480]   Whatever his feelings may be, he doesn't decide, and he shouldn't even really be concerned
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.260]   about it.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.560]   It goes as far as that.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:56.800]   The Christian should not be concerned in any way to arrive at a decision about this matter.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   He must always submit.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:04.480]   Now let me give you another quotation where this great apostle is saying the same thing,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.520]   perhaps in a slightly fuller manner.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.880]   Take what he says in the second epistle to the Corinthians, and in chapter 5.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.840]   He's been describing at the end of chapter 4, the terrible trials and tribulations through
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.960]   which he was passing.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.720]   And he says, "Our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:31.640]   exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen,
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.040]   but at the things which are not seen.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.520]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.960]   Then he goes on, "For we know, we know as Christians, that if our earthly house of this
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:48.400]   tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, and a house not made with him, is
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   eternal in the heavens."
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.000]   The tabernacle is the body, of course.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.960]   Then he says, "In this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.280]   which is from heaven."
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.360]   Now he says that is true of the Christian.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.160]   He groans in this tabernacle for the reasons he's just been given.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:14.320]   And he earnestly desires to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.880]   The Christian knows that he's going to be glorified, that his very body is going to
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   be glorified.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.640]   And this is to him the blessed hope.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.960]   A Christian is a man who looks forward to this, this grand regeneration, this great
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.160]   age which is coming, when as he puts it in the end of the third chapter of the epistle
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.680]   to the Philippians, when Christ shall come, this great savior, who is able to change this
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:45.120]   our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to that
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.880]   mighty working whereby he is able to subdue even all things to himself.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:55.440]   Now then says Paul, "Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   heaven.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.200]   If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked."
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:07.880]   Then on he goes, "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened."
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:15.520]   Now watch, "Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.720]   swallowed up of life."
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:25.960]   Now he means by that just this, that a Christian is a man who never says, "I wish I were dead."
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.080]   But he, like that, in that tone of voice.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.560]   Now people often say that, don't they?
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.200]   Of course, they don't mean it.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.240]   "I wish I were dead."
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.800]   People are in trouble, things are going wrong.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.560]   They say, "I wish I were dead.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.240]   I wish I could get out of it all."
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.280]   Now what the apostle is saying here is, a Christian never speaks like that.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.000]   A Christian should never speak like that.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.200]   That is something a Christian should never say.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.420]   Because that, you see, is a sort of defeatism.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.440]   That is sheer selfishness.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.000]   You wish you could go out of it all, to be free of your troubles and your cares and your
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   problems.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.720]   "I wish I were dead."
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.920]   The Christian doesn't say that.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.080]   But you know we've got to carry that even further.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:17.720]   That is wrong because it's despair and hopelessness and a lack of faith in the Lord.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:25.600]   But we must even go beyond that and say this, that even our earnestly desiring to be clothed
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:35.320]   upon with our house, which is from him, even that must not trap us or entice us into desiring
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.120]   to be there and to be dead.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.640]   There is all the difference in the world between looking forward to this as the great hope
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.680]   that is set before us, something that we know is going to happen to us, and desiring to
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   get it at once.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.560]   That's what we mustn't do.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:57.400]   Now I hope I'm making this distinction plain and clear.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.160]   Let me give you a story, tell you a story, which I think will help to make this point
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.160]   clear.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:10.480]   There's a story of the meeting of the great George Whitefield with the great family of
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.280]   the tenants in America.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.840]   And the story that I have to relate is a story, if I remember rightly, of how Whitefield for
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.960]   the first time met the old William Tennant, the father of those brilliant sons, Gilbert
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.760]   and William Junior and others.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.640]   And they were there, and they were having a most happy time of Christian fellowship
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   together.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:41.280]   Whitefield, remember, was a very young man at this particular point, somewhere around
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.200]   about twenty-five years of age.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.400]   But as you know, he was a highly spiritual young man.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:55.720]   He was a man who had marvelous manifestations of the love of God, unusual communion with
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.720]   God.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.440]   A most heavenly-minded man was George Whitefield.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.720]   And he was preaching hard and working beyond probably his own strength, but enjoying it
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   and reveling in it.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.400]   And they were having a meal one day.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:20.680]   And Whitefield, in a kind of ecstasy, said to the company, "Oh, how he wished that he
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.520]   could go immediately and be with the Lord."
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:31.400]   That that was his greatest desire, the desire that he might go and be with the Lord, though
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.320]   he was only twenty-five years of age.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.640]   Now, there is an aspect of it which is good and which is right.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.800]   It shows that the heavenly realm was very real to him.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   He knew God.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.920]   He knew his Lord.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:51.400]   He knew what it was to be bathed with the love of God, and that frequently.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:57.360]   In other words, there was no fear of death, of the grave, or all that had long since gone.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.960]   But the point was that the heavenly realm was so real to him that he wanted to go there.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.620]   And other saints have expressed the same desire.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.000]   But the moment Whitefield said that, old William Tennant gave him a very sharp rebuke.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.960]   And he was undoubtedly right.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:21.160]   He said, "Young men, your business is to preach the gospel and not to be concerned
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.240]   as to when you are going to die.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.280]   You shouldn't even be interested in it.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.800]   You should be just going on serving the Lord, preaching this glorious gospel, enjoying this
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   privilege.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.320]   You should leave this other question entirely to him.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.520]   What right have you to say, 'I wish I were there'?
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.200]   How do you know what he wants you to do?
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:46.560]   What right have you to insinuate your own desires to the Lord and into the mind and
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.400]   the thinking of the Lord?"
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.000]   And William Tennant was undoubtedly right.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.600]   That is what Paul is saying here.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.320]   None of us, not one of us, lives to himself.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.680]   Not one of us dies to himself.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.980]   We shouldn't be interested in this.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:08.200]   This should be a matter which to us is to be left entirely in the hands of the Lord.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.640]   So I would sum it up by putting it like this.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.720]   No Christian should ever desire to end life.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.120]   Now I'm not only thinking of suicide there.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.360]   I'm taking it in a more general sense.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.040]   Not that we should be unclothed.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.440]   We mustn't be concerned about ending our life.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.400]   Of course, we all know what the feeling is, don't we?
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.120]   If we're overtired or things are difficult.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.880]   Remember the psalmist puts it in his way, "Oh, that I have the wings of a dove, that
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.160]   I get out of it all."
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:42.280]   Now we must never say that sort of thing, either in terms of moving somewhere else in
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.240]   this world or moving out of the world altogether.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.040]   "Oh, that I were out of it all."
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   Very natural.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.600]   And of course, as I say, there is an aspect of this which is very glorious and very wonderful.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.920]   It means that a man knows where he's going and has no fears and looks forward to being
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.000]   with the Lord and so on.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.760]   But the Christian is a man who doesn't desire to end his life.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.800]   But there is another thing I have to say also.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:21.840]   We must at the same time be ready to go whenever it is his will.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.280]   You see, it's entirely in his hand.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.960]   We don't decide it.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.040]   We don't decide it in the matter of desiring to go.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.200]   We don't decide it in the matter of not desiring to go.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:40.240]   Now Christian people, there is something I think which we tend to neglect.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:48.720]   It is to be entirely his will, as to when I go, as to how I go, or where I am when I
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.720]   go.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   Now this is Christianity, and it solves so many of our problems, doesn't it?
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.200]   It is his decision.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.760]   It isn't ours.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.560]   It may be that he'll call you to a death of martyrdom.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.900]   You mustn't shrink from it.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.560]   You mustn't deny the gospel in order to save your life.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.880]   If that is his will and his decision for you, don't you shrink from it?
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.240]   Don't hold back?
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.120]   See, this is the balance of the other side.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.800]   You mustn't desire to go, but you mustn't shrink from going.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   It's his decision altogether.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.680]   He knows his plan for you.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.200]   He knows how he's going to glorify himself through you.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.440]   You may have a long, lingering death.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.860]   You may die suddenly.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.560]   To the Christian, it shouldn't matter.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.840]   Now we often talk lightly and loosely, don't we?
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.360]   We say, "I hope when my time comes I'll die suddenly."
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.920]   You shouldn't say that.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.600]   Not for you to decide how you go.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.640]   Don't let the fear of the physical enter into this at all.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.720]   This is not for you.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   It is for him.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.180]   Now, this is the thing.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.600]   We do not determine our life or our death.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.120]   This is the truly Christian position.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.440]   My times are in thy hands.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.240]   My God, I will them there.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:21.760]   I'm so in awe that hymn which we sang just now, which, you see, puts it so perfectly
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.920]   and so gloriously that I really must read it for you again because it is one of the
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.040]   most wonderful statements of this.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.480]   "Lord, it belongs not to my care whether I die or live.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.560]   No man liveth unto himself.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.160]   No man dieth unto himself.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.020]   To love and serve thee is my share, and this thy grace must give.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:51.360]   If life belong, I will be glad that I may long obey, if short.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:57.240]   Yet why should I be sad to soar to endless day?
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   Christ leads me through no darker rooms than he went through before.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.760]   He that into God's kingdom comes must enter by this door.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:14.020]   Come Lord, when grace hath made me meet thy blessed face to see.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:20.300]   For if thy work on earth be sweet, what will thy glory be?
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:27.980]   Then I shall end my sad complaints and weary sinful days and join with the triumphant saints
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.420]   that sing Jehovah's praise.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:37.300]   My knowledge of that life is small, the eye of faith is dim, but is enough.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:42.700]   Christ knows all, and I shall be with him."
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:49.940]   You see, he knows about the weary sinful days and the complaints and so on, but still he
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.940]   doesn't because of that say, "I wish I were dead, oh that I could get out of it all."
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.940]   No, no.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:00.340]   It belongs not to my care whether I die or live, and then you get this balance right
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.340]   through.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.540]   If life's going to be long, well, I still have more opportunity for doing it.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.540]   If it's short, I've no complaint, quite the reverse.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.500]   It means that I should soar to endless day and to be with him.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:17.820]   Well now there you see, in the seventh verse, he puts it in that negative form.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.180]   Now the eighth verse is just the same thing put into the positive form.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:27.780]   And of course the apostle does this negative and positive because he wants to drive home
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.020]   his point and his principle.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.420]   "None of us liveth to himself, no man dieth to himself.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.500]   For whether we live, we live unto the Lord.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.260]   Whether we die, we die unto the Lord.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.940]   Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord."
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:47.980]   Now it's in the positive form for emphasis, and this is why the Christian does not live
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.980]   to himself or for himself.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:58.220]   He is one who is entirely in the hands of the Lord in every respect.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.600]   Not only about eating meats or eating herbs, not only about observing days or not observing
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.080]   days, in everything.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.820]   This is the principle that covers the whole of his life.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.220]   Now Paul again, you see, has put this same thing in the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.420]   once more, but this time in the ninth chapter and in the twenty-first verse.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.620]   He's talking about preaching to Jews and to Gentiles.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.740]   He says, "Though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself a servant unto all,
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.980]   that I might gain them all.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.420]   Unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.500]   To them that are under the law as under the law, that I might gain them that are under
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.500]   the law.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   To them that are without the law as without law, then brackets, being not without law
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.660]   to God, but under the law to Christ."
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.500]   That's the thing.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.980]   We are under the law to Christ.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.620]   Whether we live, we live unto the Lord.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.340]   Whether we die, we die unto the Lord.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:59.380]   Whatever we do, living or dying, we are always the Lord's and under the law.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.820]   Or another way in which Paul is so fond of putting this, watch how he starts out his
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:13.980]   epistle, "Paul, an apostle, the servant," which means the bond-slave, "of Jesus Christ."
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.220]   He's a bond-slave of the Lord.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:22.580]   And here he emphasizes that by using this expression, "the Lord," three times over.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:26.620]   In everything, we are the Lord's.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:30.940]   Now this is the most important thing about us as Christians, and it is something that
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.700]   we must never forget.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.700]   Are you looking at life?
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.620]   Well, very well, look at life, says Paul, in that way.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:42.100]   Now he puts it, you see, at greater length in the first chapter of the epistle to the
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.100]   Philippians.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.540]   Here he is, he's in prison.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.360]   He hears rumors that he may be put to death at any moment.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.780]   But he says, "According to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed,
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:58.140]   but that with all boldness as always, so now also, Christ shall be magnified in my body,
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.540]   whether it be by life or by death.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:06.900]   For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.740]   For if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.940]   I am in a strait betwixt two," says Paul, "having a desire to depart and be with Christ,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:15.940]   which is far better."
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:19.980]   Yes, the poor man, he was an old and a sick man, and he was in prison.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.900]   That's his natural desire, to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.220]   "Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you, and having this confidence,
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:33.860]   I know that I shall abide and continue with you, all for your furtherance and joy of faith.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:40.020]   That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming unto you."
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.020]   Now, you see, he holds this same balance again.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.580]   To live is Christ.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.280]   To die is again Christ.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   Everything is Christ.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:56.820]   Or, as he puts it in Galatians 2, "The life I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.260]   of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.940]   I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   This is living.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.620]   "No man liveth unto himself.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.300]   He that liveth, liveth to the Lord."
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.980]   The Christian is a man who lives in the Lord and for the Lord.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.380]   Exactly the same thing applies to death.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.460]   Death is gain.
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.660]   It means to be with Christ.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.340]   If I'm in this world, it's Christ.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.700]   If I die, what is it to be with Christ, which is far better?
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.980]   So if I'm alive, it's Christ.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.740]   If I'm dead, I'm with Christ.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.500]   It's Christ always in life and in death.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.500]   Christ governs everything.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.300]   He is the Lord.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:37.180]   And what matters above everything else is our relationship to him.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:43.100]   Now, my dear friends, don't you see that if we only grasp this as we should, it would
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:48.420]   revolutionize not only our lives, but still more, our thoughts of death.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.980]   Alas, many Christian people dishonor their Lord and bring dishonor upon his name in their
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.980]   dying.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:59.420]   So many of us tend to, when we're ill or when we come to face death.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.940]   It's tragic and it's all due to ignorance.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.580]   It is our failure to realize this great teaching.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:12.420]   As a Christian, you're always with him and you're always in his hands and he governs
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.420]   this.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.420]   Don't be frightened.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:20.220]   Don't let any of your own thoughts intrude, either in life or in death.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:26.420]   Submit yourself utterly to him and to his way and he transforms everything.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:31.020]   Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.900]   Don't forget that he's controlling death as well as life.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.940]   Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:44.660]   You know, Christians have always found this a little bit difficult to grasp and to understand.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.260]   There's a very interesting commentary on all this in the last chapter of the Gospel, according
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.700]   to St. John.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.700]   You remember it?
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.700]   Our Lord and Peter.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.740]   The Lord having restored Peter said to him, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, when thou
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.740]   wast young, thou girdest thyself and walkest whither thou wouldest.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:08.780]   But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.060]   and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.500]   This speak he, signifying by what death he should glorify God."
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.180]   Why did our Lord say that to Peter?
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.620]   Well, here's the context.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:27.100]   Peter, you remember, in order to save his life, had denied his Lord three times over.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.620]   What our Lord is saying to him now when he's restored him is this, "Peter, you wanted
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.860]   to decide the way you were going to die, the mode of death, and the place and the time
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.540]   and other things concerning death.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.700]   You took charge of it.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.500]   Peter, you mustn't do that."
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.500]   He prophesied to Peter here, what according to tradition literally came to pass, that
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.700]   Peter was crucified, and crucified upside down.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:58.420]   That speak he, signifying what manner of death he should die, signifying by what death he
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.180]   should glorify God.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.980]   And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, "Follow me."
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.460]   In other words, he's saying to him, "Peter, don't you worry about this.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.060]   Leave this to me.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.260]   You are going to glorify God in your death."
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.460]   Now, that wasn't Peter's idea.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.460]   Peter didn't want it.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.940]   His idea is escape, or to die in some other way.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:19.940]   This is the way.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.660]   It's going to be a terrible, horrible way, but he's going to glorify God, the thing he
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.020]   was most afraid of, in his death.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.580]   But still Peter doesn't quite understand this.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.220]   Then Peter turning about, seeth a disciple whom Jesus loved following, which also leaned
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:40.860]   on his breast at supper and said, "Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?"
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:46.180]   Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, "Lord, what shall this man do?"
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:54.620]   Referring to John, Jesus saith unto him, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.620]   that to thee?
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.620]   Follow thou me."
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:01.460]   Peter's not only anxious to control his own death, he's a bit concerned as to how John's
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.460]   going to die.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:07.060]   If he, Peter, is going to die this terrible, horrible death of crucifixion upside down
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.060]   to glorify God, what's going to happen to John?
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.700]   "That's not your business, sir, leave your own death to me, leave his death to me as
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.700]   well.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.700]   What is that to thee?
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.500]   Follow thou me.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:23.340]   If I will that he tarry till I come, if he's not going to die at all, but be still on earth
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.660]   when I come, what's it to do with you?
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.540]   Follow thou me."
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.660]   Now this is the kind of teaching, you see.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:33.420]   This is the very thing that the apostle is telling us here.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.740]   Indeed, our Lord has taught the same thing.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:41.620]   We needn't be concerned about this matter of death in any shape or form.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.100]   Do you remember his parable of Dives and Lazarus?
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.780]   Do you remember what he tells us?
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.460]   The rich man died and was buried.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:53.060]   Lazarus was carried on angels' wings into Abram's bosom.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.420]   That's how the Christian dies.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.980]   You've nothing to fear.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.380]   You mustn't begin to think of how and lay down your postulates and your desires and
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.380]   your demands.
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.980]   Leave it all to him.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:12.860]   He's in charge and you'll be carried on angels' wings into the very presence of God in heaven.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.820]   And thank God, this is something that the saints have proved.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.500]   Do you remember the famous story of the martyrdom of Stephen?
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.220]   When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart and they gnashed him with their
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   teeth.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:29.620]   But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:35.420]   of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said, "Behold, I see the heavens
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.820]   open and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God."
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:49.860]   And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:55.780]   And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge."
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.340]   When he had said this, he fell asleep.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.100]   That's the death of the saints.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.100]   It's glorious.
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.100]   It's wonderful.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.940]   One of the most amazing things about Stephen.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.420]   You and I would think he was cut down at the beginning of his career as a preacher and
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.420]   so on.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:15.420]   My dear friends, we don't know, we don't understand about Stephen, nor about ourselves.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.420]   It is his matter.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.420]   It is his business.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   Leave it all to him.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:29.460]   Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, for they shall rest from their labours and
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.700]   their works to follow.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:40.300]   No man liveth unto himself, no man dieth unto himself.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:45.260]   Whether we live, we live unto the Lord, or whether we die, we die unto the Lord.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:51.180]   Whether we live or die, therefore, we are the Lord.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:58.260]   Now then, says the apostle, it's not only a question of what meats you eat, or whether
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.500]   you eat herbs, it's not a question of whether you observe days or don't observe days.
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.500]   What matters is this, the Lord.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:12.100]   As long as you can say that you're in his hands, that you've submitted yourself, mind,
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:20.420]   heart, will, everything to him, that you are not concerned about yourself, put yourself
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.460]   in the center, it's all right, says Paul.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.820]   All is well.
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:31.340]   And as long as that man who doesn't eat the meats and observes the days is animated by
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.180]   this, be careful what you say to him.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:36.300]   And it's equally true of the other man.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:46.340]   The Christian always is entirely submitted unto the Lord and his will and his way.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.020]   May God open our eyes to this.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:53.780]   He transforms life, he transforms death.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:59.540]   As Christians, we are always in his hands and we are always safe.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:08.940]   O Lord, our God, we thank thee for thy word, for its glory, and for all that it tells us
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.860]   about ourselves, as in Christ Jesus.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:19.140]   O Lord, open our eyes, enable us to see these things.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:25.460]   Forgive us that so often, though we are clear about our salvation and the grounds of our
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.620]   salvation, we fall from that position.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:34.500]   When we come to think of these particular matters, O God, forgive us the folly of taking
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:41.580]   ourselves back to ourselves and being concerned and anxious and worried and burdened about
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.300]   ourselves, whether in life or in death.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:52.020]   O, help us to see the folly of doing that and enable us by thy Spirit to realize that
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:57.580]   always, in life or in death, we are the Lord.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.140]   O Lord, our God, hear us.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:06.900]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:13.300]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now, throughout the remainder
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:23.580]   of this, our short, uncertain, earthly life and pilgrimage, and forever.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:24.180]   Amen.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.180]   Amen.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.180]   Amen.
