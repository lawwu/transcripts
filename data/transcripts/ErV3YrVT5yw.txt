[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   [music]
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.280]   Stephan writes in to ask, "Pastor John, how do you feel about pastors who use
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.360]   ghostwriters to produce sermons, blogs, books, or other written content from
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.420]   their ministry in their name?"
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.140]   I don't like it. In fact, I'm against it. I think it's wrong, Tony.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.620]   But let me define what I mean, lest--they mean something I don't mean.
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.280]   I don't want to accuse inappropriately.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:47.120]   99% of readers believe that a byline, my name under a book title, means I wrote it.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.120]   Either I spoke it, like Spurgeon, and someone wrote it down, or I took a pen or
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.440]   a computer and I wrote it.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.320]   That's what they assume, and therefore, it doesn't matter whether two publishers
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.280]   agree that's not what it means, or an author and an editor, "Well, we don't think
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.520]   that's what it means."
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.840]   Well, it is what it means, and you can't play fast and loose with people's
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.280]   interpretations that way. That's what a byline means, and I hope it stays that
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.000]   way. And therefore, I think to put your name on a book you didn't write is a lie,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   and the people would be shocked if someone got the idea that, "This is just
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.840]   your ideas." Like this person took a one-page set of ideas that they got from
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.600]   your sermons, they turned it into a book, and you put your name on the book.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.160]   That's a lie. And God said, "Thou shalt not lie." God said, "Love the truth."
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.760]   We're pastors. We are people who serve the truth.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.920]   Our standards for truth should be higher than anybody's standards for truth,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.680]   not lower than anybody's standards. Now, I believe in editors, big time.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.720]   David Mathis at DG is called Senior Editor. I sent off to him a book yesterday,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.040]   or was it the day before yesterday, and I said, "Go at it, David.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.640]   Help me avoid error. Help me not say things stupid.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.240]   Help me get my grammar right." So he's going to send this back to me,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   and there'll be some blue, you know, highlighting in it.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.320]   And if that editing process reaches a point where this is anywhere near
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.080]   substantially David's work, his name is going on it.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.520]   So I put John Piper with David Mathis. Let me give you another example.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.200]   A lot of guys do this, don't do this, and I think they should.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.440]   People write letters for them. People write letters for presidents of schools
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.400]   and presidents of organizations. He just signs them and sends them out.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   I just think that's a lie. If Josh Edder, who's one of our directors
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.640]   at Desiring God, wants me to write a letter to ask our listeners to support,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.100]   if he sends me the substance of the letter and it's written and I like it,
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.040]   and I tweak a sentence here and a sentence there, I say to Josh,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.840]   "I'm not going to put my name on this without your name, period.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.640]   Your name's going on there. You wrote this and I tweaked it.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.480]   But if he sends me an email that's got five bullet points,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.720]   please include these things in what you say, this statistic and that deadline
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.720]   and this condition of our budget and whatever, and I take those five things
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.880]   and I write it, I'll put my name on it."
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.520]   So I realized that we get help in what we do, and I think, frankly,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   we should be way more than eager to give credit where credit is due.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.160]   So what I already wrote the forward to my book, I mean, the word to the reader,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.080]   and I put in it, "Thank you, David Mathis, for this and that,"
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.320]   because he's already done work in helping me assemble the pieces
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.400]   that went into that book. So my answer, Tony, to all the fears
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.880]   of putting somebody else's name on your book with you is that God
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.200]   will honor that. Publishers don't like it.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.560]   They don't want two names on a book. Well, tell them you're going to be honest
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.600]   and you wrote this with so-and-so, and then God himself will honor
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.880]   that truthfulness.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.960]   - Yeah, and so for those who are not aware, apparently, from what I gather,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.720]   this is a pretty significant problem in the publishing world.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.760]   - Evidently. I mean, I don't know them, but I hear that that's the case.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.480]   And in fact, there was a scandal some years ago where, I won't name any names,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.520]   but a name of a well-known person who has become a leader in the homosexual
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.640]   movement was found to be a ghost writer who actually wrote the books for three
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.880]   or four very well-known Christians. And when I heard that, my heart just sank.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.520]   It really sank. My estimation of those men's integrity sank several notches.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.920]   And, you know, while I'm talking, Tony, one other thing comes to my mind.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:28.120]   I believe that a book or an essay in a book is a craft. It's an art.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.560]   When people appreciate writing, they're not appreciating just a nugget
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.160]   of an idea that have incidental words around it. That's not what's happening.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.600]   If this book is well-written, people are enjoying the craft of writing.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.080]   And who's getting the credit for the craft? The guy who did not produce
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.040]   the craft. And that's just wrong. It's wrong for people to be sitting there
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.120]   saying, "This is really good. This is effective. I'm pleased with this.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.520]   I'm enjoying this." And they're thanking God for Pastor So-and-So,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   and he didn't have anything to do with that craft. That's just wrong.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.160]   Yeah, thank you for that, Pastor John. Thank you for listening to this podcast.
