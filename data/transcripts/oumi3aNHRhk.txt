[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Tonight, before I pray, I want to begin our study by reading from Ephesians 1-3-14.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.440]   And this will sort of be our devotional thought for tonight, as well as I think a good lead-in
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.760]   to our study on the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.440]   Ephesians 1-3-14, and if you have your Bibles, go ahead and turn there.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   This is a, as you know, a wonderful celebration of our blessings of salvation.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.960]   I remember over 20 years ago, I was in preaching lab at the Master's Seminary, and Pastor Alex
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.400]   Montoya was the evaluator in that preaching lab, and he was known for his direct critiques
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   of the students' preaching styles.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200]   And I preached on Ephesians 1-3-14.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.040]   I was so excited about this text.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.280]   It was more heat than light.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.120]   I was sort of so excited about the text, I didn't really have an organization or flow
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.520]   to what I was saying.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.280]   And I remember after I finished, Pastor Montoya said to me, "You're like a little kid in a
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.840]   candy store.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.920]   You're so excited about the candy, you're not sure which one to grab."
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.160]   And I took that critique humbly, and yet I confess that over 20 years later I'm here,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.080]   and I still feel like a kid in a candy store when I read this passage.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.280]   It's impossible to read Ephesians 1 without getting excited about what God has done in
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   our lives.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.000]   But just as we read this, what I want to do for tonight as we turn our focus to the doctrine
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.280]   of the Trinity is I just want you to note how many times specifically the persons of
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.720]   the Trinity are distinguished in this wonderful passage, how many times the work of God the
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.920]   Father is distinguished from the work of God the Son, how many times the work of God the
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.200]   Son is distinguished from God the Holy Spirit, and how an understanding of the roles and
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.960]   relationships within the unity of the Trinity is essential for us to understand the grace
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.420]   of God in our salvation.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.480]   It's really essential for us to understand the greatness of God's plan and all that He
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.800]   has done for us in salvation.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.640]   And so let me read this for us, and just note the ways that Paul distinguishes the work
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.160]   of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as we read this text.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.640]   Paul says in verse 3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.560]   blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.160]   Just as He," that is the Father, "chose us in Him," that is Christ, "before the foundation
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.240]   of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.320]   In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.280]   to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.520]   freely bestowed on us in the Beloved," and that is Christ the Son.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.880]   In Him," that is Christ, "we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.400]   trespasses according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished on us.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.000]   In all wisdom and insight He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.960]   kind intention, which He purposed in Him, with a view to an administration suitable
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.600]   to the fullness of the times," that is the summing up of all things in Christ, things
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.320]   in the heavens and things on the earth.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.640]   In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.600]   who works all things after the counsel of His will, to the end, that we who were the
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.840]   first to hope in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.660]   In Him you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation, having
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.920]   also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who was given
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.320]   as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.520]   to the praise of His glory."
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.160]   And what a wonderful passage that is, that celebrates our salvation in Christ.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.840]   You'll find here that this is not only a celebration of our salvation, it's really a celebration
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.480]   of the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.000]   You find in this passage the work of the Father explained and clarified, it is the Father
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.360]   who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.320]   In this passage we find the work of the Son celebrated and unfolded to us, verse 7 says,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.000]   "In Him, that is Christ, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   trespasses."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.760]   So it's not the Father who died on the cross to save us from our sins.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.960]   It's not the Spirit who died on the cross to pay for our sins.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:55.400]   It is the work of the Son, the perfect substitute, the perfect Redeemer and mediator, in whom
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.160]   we have redemption, the purchase of our souls for eternity.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.200]   So you have the work of the Father explained and clarified, the work of the Son, and then
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:13.880]   in verse 13 you have the work of the Spirit defined and recognized.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.240]   Paul says, "In Him, you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:26.200]   and believed in Him, were sealed with a promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance."
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.320]   So the Holy Spirit has come to live in us and to bear His fruit in us.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.480]   Even in this one passage we make the observation that the Father is not the Son, the Son is
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   not the Spirit, the Spirit is not the Father.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:53.520]   There are distinct roles and relationships which exist within the unity of who God is.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.320]   And yet we also find that there are not three gods, there is one God.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:08.720]   And so we get the whole concept of triunity or trinity, that this is not a text that teaches
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:21.880]   polytheism, there is one God, and yet God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.200]   are distinct.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.960]   They are three persons, yet one God.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.720]   Triunity or trinity.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.520]   So the implication of Ephesians 1 is that we cannot understand the greatness of our
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.360]   salvation, we cannot understand the greatness of God's grace, we cannot understand the
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:50.640]   wonders of what God has done in our lives apart from an understanding of the trinity.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.000]   We must understand the doctrine of the trinity to celebrate the wonders of God's amazing
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.160]   grace in our lives.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   And I would go one step further in saying that the entire Christian life is defined
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.560]   by our understanding of the trinity.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.640]   Think about Christian worship.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:19.520]   What is Christian worship is we come into the presence of God the Father, we come through
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:26.120]   the work of God the Son, who is the one substitute, who is the one mediator, who is the great
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:33.520]   high priest, he is the one who stands in between us and the Father.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:40.120]   We come through the Son's perfect work into the presence of the Father, and we come as
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.640]   we are empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:51.220]   It is the Spirit who lives in us and who leads us to embrace the fullness of all that the
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:57.960]   Son has accomplished for us, and by embracing through faith the Son's perfect work on our
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:04.280]   behalf, we come with boldness and with confidence into the presence of the Father who loves
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.080]   us and who embraces us.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.280]   Think about Christian prayer.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.640]   Romans 8 verse 15 says, "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear,
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:27.760]   but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   So there you have a Trinitarian understanding of prayer in Romans 8.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:42.720]   It's as we're filled with the Holy Spirit of God, it says the Spirit of God leads us
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:51.040]   and empowers us, we are assured of the Son's perfect work on our behalf, and so we relate
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.640]   to God as Father.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.960]   And this is not the – I always think of the Von Trapp family in that musical Sound
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.360]   of Music where they all lined up and they kind of had this formal, distant relationship
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:14.440]   with Mr. Von Trapp, the father, and they kind of said in a formal, distant way, "Father."
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.160]   That's not the type of spirit that Paul's talking about in Romans 8 verse 15.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:29.960]   He's talking about the young child who eagerly and boldly runs into his or her father's presence
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.520]   knowing that the father will embrace the child and love the child.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   "Abba, Father!"
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:47.440]   That's the cry of intimacy, "Abba, Papa, Dada," the cry of a young child.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.960]   The more a person is filled with a spirit, the more their prayer life looks like a child
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.640]   who is talking to a heavenly father.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.680]   And this is the fruit of the Holy Spirit working in a believer's life.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.840]   What about Christian evangelism?
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.120]   It is impossible without an understanding of the Trinity.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:22.920]   We proclaim the Son and His saving work on our behalf as we are empowered by the Holy
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:33.980]   Spirit and we desire for men to be reconciled to God and to relate to God as their father.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.720]   And then there is the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:46.160]   So I want to let you know that Theology Exam #7 is really critical for an understanding
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   of biblical counseling.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.580]   I mean, on one hand, I think ACBC put this essay in there because they want just to make
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:12:01.560]   sure that we're certifying theologically orthodox believers as biblical counselors, believers
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.400]   who believe in the Trinity as revealed in Scripture.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:13.840]   But I think on the other hand, this has tremendous implications for counseling ministry.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.440]   We are distinctly Trinitarian in our convictions about how ministry is to be done.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:26.200]   And that distinguishes us from every other form of secular counseling that is out there
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.880]   in the world today.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   We desire to minister in the power of the Spirit.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.440]   We desire to minister the truth of the Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:45.360]   And we desire that men and women draw near to God as Father.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.720]   We are distinctly Trinitarian in our conviction.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:13:00.440]   And so my devotional encouragement to you really comes from Bruce Ware's excellent sermon.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:07.160]   This was, I put this on your resource handout from the Dropbox folder.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.040]   He has an excellent sermon called The Trinity of Persons.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   He actually has three messages from that conference, the Desiring God Conference 2005, that's available
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.480]   as a free download.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.720]   But if you're going to listen to one, listen to The Trinity of Persons, that's message
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.520]   number one.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.200]   And I'd encourage you to listen to that just to get pumped up to write this essay because
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.680]   it's an excellent treatment of the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:42.300]   Bruce Ware actually has a book that was published, it's called Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Roles
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.080]   and Relationships.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:51.200]   It is out of print, but if you want to spend some time trying to find a used version of
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:57.160]   that, that book is worth its weight in gold just as a phenomenal job articulating the
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:04.740]   doctrine of the Trinity and its practical implications for a Christian life and ministry.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.120]   But he writes this, or he says this in the sermon, "We need to put on our Trinitarian
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:15.680]   glasses as we read the Bible and notice Father, Son, and Spirit.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.080]   When we do so, we'll find there is a richness that is there that we have not seen.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.800]   May God help us and open our eyes to see more of his glory, more of his greatness, more
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.440]   of the richness of who God is as he is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.200]   So with that thought, let me pray for us and devote our time to the Lord.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.800]   Father, we thank you that we can come to you with boldness, with confidence, because we
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:51.480]   come trusting in the perfect work of your Son, Jesus Christ, the one mediator between
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.480]   God and man.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.720]   We thank you that we come to you not on the basis of our own merits, but on the merits
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:04.680]   of your Son who lived and died and who rose again on our behalf.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.280]   And we thank you that you have given us your Spirit who lives in us that we might know
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:16.200]   Christ and that we might rejoice in the fullness of your blessings to us.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.340]   And Father, we would pray that you would bless our time together.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.660]   Thank you for each student joining on this webinar.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.520]   Pray that you would bless their studies.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.160]   Pray that our study of the doctrine of the Trinity would yield a greater understanding
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:37.480]   of who you are, a greater understanding of your amazing grace, and a greater understanding
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.400]   of how we are to minister in the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.080]   And so yield much fruit from this time, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:16:02.180]   Okay, so tonight's topic is the doctrine of the Trinity, and we are looking at Theology
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.960]   Exam #7, which reads as follows, "Explain the doctrine of the Trinity and provide its
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.320]   biblical basis."
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.160]   So if you look at your handout on page 1 of your handout, I gave you some good reading
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.760]   on the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:22.000]   Paul Enns has an excellent section there in the Moody Handbook of Theology.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.240]   Wayne Grudem probably has one of the most readable and clear sections on the doctrine
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.720]   of the Trinity that I've come across.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:38.600]   I don't know how you're going to improve on just reading Grudem's work and doing some
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:44.560]   summary work there, footnoting some relevant sections from his systematic theology, but
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.760]   he has an excellent treatment on the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:54.800]   I'd encourage you to read that whole chapter and also read the parts where he distinguishes
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.280]   the theological errors of the Trinity.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.080]   We'll touch on a little bit in this session, but he has an excellent work there.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.640]   I commend that to you.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.320]   And then Charles Ryrie has a good chapter on the Trinity as well.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:18.640]   I also want to recommend the book Christ-Centered Biblical Counseling, which is a compilation
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:27.800]   of different writers writing on key themes on biblical counseling that was edited by
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.460]   Bob Kellerman and Steve Vires, and that is an excellent resource.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:39.180]   Chapter four in that book was written by Kevin Carson and Jeff Forey.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.260]   It's called The Unity of the Trinity.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:48.380]   And if you want one chapter that really articulates the doctrine of the Trinity and then relates
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.860]   it to the ministry of biblical counseling, that would be the chapter to get.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:18:02.820]   It's an excellent treatment of how the doctrine of the Trinity impacts and informs the ministry
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.700]   of biblical counseling, so I highly commend that to you.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.020]   And I do want to quote from that chapter to introduce our study tonight.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.420]   This isn't on your handout, but I put it on the screen there.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:21.900]   The authors write, "A clear grasp of the relational model exhibited in the Triune God directly
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.740]   impacts the purpose and the practice of the biblical counselor."
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:33.900]   So implication is theology exam number seven is immensely practical.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.180]   We're not just testing theological orthodoxy.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:43.900]   We're trying to get at a doctrine that will be the foundation for your counseling ministry.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.500]   They continue, "Regarding purpose, the counselor focuses on both the vertical and horizontal
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.820]   relationships of the counselee.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:58.340]   The purpose of counseling is to help the counselee view life and trials in the light of a personal
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.740]   relationship with the Triune God.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:08.100]   As the counselee understands this primary relationship in all areas of life, the counselee
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:14.780]   grows in horizontal relationship with others as well.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:20.500]   When the process of counseling flows out of a Trinitarian model, the counselor and counselee
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:27.860]   share a rich, deep-rooted, tender, and united relationship with each other in Christ.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:35.900]   All forms of detached, professional, solution-oriented, aloof therapy fail to satisfy the depth, intimacy,
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:43.340]   and energy demanded by the unity of the Trinity and unity among believers."
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.820]   I think that just scratching at the surface of how the doctrine of the Trinity has tremendous
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.700]   implications for counseling ministry, one of the points that they're bringing out is
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:01.920]   that there are relationships between the persons of the Trinity.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:10.020]   God is relational not only in his relationships with believers, but you see in Scripture the
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.580]   relationship between God the Father and God the Son.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.860]   You see the relationship between God the Spirit and God the Son.
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:25.700]   You see this perfect community within the unity of the Trinity, and at some point that's
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:32.900]   a mystery that is impossible for our finite minds to understand, and yet we can trust
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:38.480]   in and believe in the plain statements of Scripture that there are relationships that
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.140]   exist between God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:51.580]   The invocation of that is that to be a Christian who worships the Triune God is to be a Christian
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.420]   who is committed to relationships.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.580]   You can't reflect the likeness of God unless you are committed to forming and developing
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.540]   relationships in the community of the body of Christ.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.500]   And so what they're saying there in that quote is that if you believe in the doctrine of
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:15.420]   the Trinity, you will become a person who is highly relational, and that will inform
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.520]   your relationship with your counselee.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:25.580]   So there are just a lot of implications here, I'm going to run out of time before I mentioned
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:32.340]   them all, but just to give you a start there, a taste of how this doctrine will inform your
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.340]   counseling ministry.
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:40.420]   They continue that the counselor is not primarily a doctor, professional, or technician.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.180]   The counselor is a friend, brother, sister, and companion in Christ amid suffering and
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.180]   sin.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.620]   So that's a good word and a great chapter to look at.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:58.460]   So on your handout, let me move to page two of your handout, and this is the doctrine
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:06.860]   of the Trinity, I love that hymn, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, all thy work shall
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.860]   praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:16.300]   Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons, blessed Trinity."
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.620]   And that's our confession of faith, we worship the Triune God.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:27.900]   And as Sinclair Ferguson writes, "The Trinity is so vast in significance because it can
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:35.600]   bring comfort to men driven to the edge by the atmosphere of sorrow about to engulf them.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.460]   The Triune One is greater in glory, deeper in mystery, and more beautiful in harmony
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.940]   than all other realities in creation.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.700]   No tragedy is too big to overwhelm Him.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:56.300]   Nothing incomprehensible to us is so to Him whose very being is incomprehensible to us.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.700]   There is no darkness deeper than the depths of the in-being of God."
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:09.940]   Now, if that's not a quote that is relevant to counseling, I don't know what is.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:16.780]   It's amazing how even, you know, theologians who aren't typically known as biblical counselors
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:22.660]   speak of themes here that are so relevant to counseling.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.260]   He says, "No tragedy is too big to overwhelm Him.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.580]   There is no darkness deeper than the depths of the in-being of God."
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:38.020]   So you're sitting with someone, a counselee, who's just going through the depths of the
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.500]   valley of despair.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:47.740]   And Ferguson says that there's nothing more helpful than you can do for that person than
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.700]   to bring this person an understanding of the Triune God.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.780]   And you can see how that might work out in counseling practice.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:05.780]   You can sit with your counselee and just minister the truth that God is your Father, that you
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:12.060]   can cry out to Him, you are a child of God, you can come boldly into His presence, you
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.820]   can pour out your heart to Him.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.420]   Even evil fathers will give good gifts to their children.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:27.140]   How much more will your heavenly Father give you good gifts if you come into His presence
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.380]   and ask and seek and knock?
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:34.660]   I mean, that's a conversation you could have with a counselee that is rooted in your understanding
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.220]   of the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:43.780]   Or you could say to your counselee, "Christ is your Savior and He has died for you.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.780]   You can rest in Him.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.840]   He has loved you when you were His enemy.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:55.260]   How much more will He love you now that you are His friend?"
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.900]   You can trust in His finished work at the cross.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.220]   He has promised never to leave you or forsake you.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.840]   I mean, those are themes you could bring out in a counseling session that are, again, rooted
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.300]   in your understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:18.580]   Or you could say to your counselee, "The Spirit of God is your comforter and He is your counselor."
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:24.540]   You see, there's just this ocean of truth that you can draw from to minister to someone
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:29.060]   who is dealing with great darkness.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.100]   Jonathan Edwards has a quote in the middle of your handout, I'll just skip down there.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.480]   He says, "God has appeared glorious to me on account of the Trinity.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:45.140]   It has made me have exalting thoughts of God, that He subsists in three persons, Father,
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.300]   Son, and Holy Ghost.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:53.820]   The sweetest joys and delights I have experienced have not been those that have arisen from
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:26:03.200]   a hope of my own good estate, but in a direct view of the glorious things of the gospel."
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.240]   I just want to pause at that point and just kind of encourage you a little bit.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:18.600]   We want our counselors in biblical counseling ministry to know more than just correct information.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.880]   We don't want to train counselors that just know the right facts.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:31.740]   We want to train counselors who, in the words of Edwards, have a view of the glorious things
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.780]   of the gospel.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:43.080]   There ought to be in every biblical counselor something of the peaceful trust and rest in
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.500]   knowing that God is your Father.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.220]   Each of us who are in biblical counseling ministry or training to be biblical counselors
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:58.440]   ought to be able to look at this world, to look at all that's going on in our nation,
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:05.200]   to look at all that's going on in terms of a pandemic and economies and our own personal
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:12.260]   lives in the midst of all of that, and to be able to say, "God is my Father, and this
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.260]   is His world.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:19.200]   This is His universe, and He's in complete control of all of this," and just be able
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.880]   to trust and to rest in that truth.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.580]   There ought to be something of that trust and peace in every biblical counselor.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:37.480]   There ought to be a sweet fellowship with Christ in every biblical counselor, just this
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:44.440]   love relationship that exists between the biblical counselor and Christ.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:50.320]   There ought to be a sense of that statement where Paul said, "For me to live is Christ
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:57.880]   and to die is gain, and He is enough for me, and my joy is found in Him," and just a love
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   for Christ.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.880]   There ought to be that in every counselor, and there ought to be a dependence on the
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.920]   Holy Spirit.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.080]   This doctrine ought to frame and shape our lives and our ministry, and what that does
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:22.780]   is it brings this sweetness, this flavor, this warm encouragement into the counseling
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:29.560]   room where the counselee can—I think it was Brad Bigney who said this—that a counselee
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:38.480]   can sense real quick if the counselor has a genuine relationship with Christ or if it's
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.960]   just spouting off correct information.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.760]   There's a big difference there, and we want our counselors to know something of the sweetness
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:55.600]   of that fellowship of a relationship with the Triune God.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.400]   If you look at that next quote there by Louis Burkhoff, he says, "It is especially when
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:10.040]   we reflect on the relation of the three persons to the divine essence," and here it is, "that
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.180]   all analogies fail us."
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:20.000]   You've heard the analogy that the Trinity is sort of like water is steam, and then water
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.080]   and ice.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:29.840]   It's an analogy that may be well-intentioned, but it doesn't capture the fullness of what
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:38.320]   the Bible teaches about the Trinity, and really it is an inadequate analogy.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.640]   He says, "All analogies fail us.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:47.680]   We become deeply conscious of the fact that the Trinity is a mystery, far beyond our comprehension.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.520]   It is the incomprehensible glory of the Godhead."
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.480]   In fact, I would say that the doctrine of the Trinity is one of the apologetics for
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.920]   the truth of the Bible.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:07.680]   How would a human mind come up with this doctrine, and yet it is the incomprehensible glory of
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:19.160]   the Godhead that He is Triune, three persons, yet not three gods, one God, a holy Trinity.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:24.360]   So let me move to, I'm going to skip some of this, but I'll move to page three on your
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:31.760]   handout, and I have there some truths that I just want to give you some encouragements
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.440]   from the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:43.640]   I think the writing of this essay, some of this is, I want to make sure that you're thinking
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:50.560]   through this doctrine in terms of how it would be used in counseling ministry, and here are
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:57.000]   three ways that I would use this to counsel my own heart, as well as to counsel others,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.460]   and you can think of your own ways, but hopefully this is a framework for you to understand
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.240]   the importance of this doctrine.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:12.880]   Number one, the supreme ruler over all the created universe is our Father.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.200]   Supreme ruler over all the created universe is our Father.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:26.720]   And do you think that has any relevance at all to counseling a believer who might be
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:34.540]   overwhelmed with care or overwhelmed with anxiety, a believer who's looking at the events
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:41.080]   of the nation and feeling despondent or feeling discouraged?
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:46.320]   Do you think that has any relevance at all to a counselee who's having extreme relational
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:53.080]   difficulties or disappointment with their family or feeling hopeless about their future?
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:58.360]   Do you think that has any relevance at all to say to that counselee, and just remind
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:06.040]   them from the truth of scripture that the one who has created all things and rules over
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:16.320]   this created universe relates to us as a gracious and loving heavenly Father?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:22.040]   I know I need to hear that on a daily basis, and I'm sure my counselees need to hear that
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.680]   as well.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.040]   The hymn writer said, "This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears all nature
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.280]   sings and around me rings the music of the spheres.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.720]   This is my Father's world.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:44.240]   I rest me in the thought of rocks and trees and skies and seas, his hand the wonders wrought."
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:55.040]   I think of the illustration that Jesus uses of, you know, even earthly fathers who are
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:02.400]   sinful and wicked know how to give good gifts to their children.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.720]   And I just think of that often.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.960]   You know, those of you who know my children know that they can be really bold.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:17.240]   My daughter will come up to me at church and have no problem just saying, "Hey, Dad, I
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.680]   need money," or, "Dad, I'm going to Chipotle with my friends.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.000]   I need you to pay for it."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.240]   And she's very secure in my love for her because she has no problem just asking for things.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:37.320]   She knows that Daddy loves me and that he's going to take care of me.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:46.040]   And that's, in Jesus' analogy in Matthew 7, that's even a sinful, imperfect father knows
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.480]   how to give good gifts to their children.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:57.720]   How much more does our Heavenly Father know how to give good gifts to those who love him?
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:03.520]   So one of the things you want to disciple into your counselees is this understanding
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:15.280]   of trust in and rest in and a drawing near to God as your Heavenly Father.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   This is at the bottom of your handout, the last quote there at the bottom, G. I. Packer.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.120]   Wonderful statement there.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:30.560]   It says, "God receives us as sons and loves us with the same steadfast affection with
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.920]   which he eternally loves his beloved only begotten.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.800]   There are no distinctions of affection in the divine family.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.040]   We are all loved just as fully as Jesus is loved.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.240]   It is like a fairy story.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.040]   The reigning monarch adopts waifs and strays to make princes of them.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.960]   But praise God, it is not a fairy story.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.440]   It is hard and solid fact.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.240]   Founded on the bedrock of free and sovereign grace, this and nothing less than this is
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.800]   what adoption means.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:11.100]   No wonder John cries, 'Behold, what manner of love when once you understand adoption,
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.080]   your heart will cry the same.'
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.720]   Nor is this all."
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.080]   Just a wonderful statement there.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:26.320]   The supreme ruler over all creation is our father.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.920]   Number two, the son in whom the father is well-pleased is our savior, substitute, mediator
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.300]   and friend.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:43.360]   The son in whom the father is well-pleased is our savior, substitute, mediator and friend.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:54.920]   This is talking about our focus on the work of Christ, his life, death and resurrection.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:01.160]   By the way, I think the last time I taught this class, we got to this essay right around
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.160]   Good Friday and Easter.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:09.200]   And I made a statement that I hope you understand that Good Friday and Easter are biblical counseling
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.440]   holidays.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:18.440]   I hope you see the connection between the death of Jesus Christ on the cross, his triumphant
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:26.120]   resurrection from the grave and the issues and the problems that people are facing today.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:33.840]   If you can't draw a connection from Good Friday and Easter to the counseling room, then you
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:40.640]   need to do some work on your theology and also how that relates to practical ministry.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.400]   Because those are biblical counseling holidays.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:49.000]   Whatever the issue is, Christ died to save us from our sins and he rose again to free
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.040]   us from the power of sin.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.440]   And therefore, whatever the counseling issue is, we can make progress by the grace of Christ
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:02.220]   and become more like Jesus Christ in our everyday lives.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:08.560]   So I gave you as a supplement on your handout, the statement by Ernie Baker, "Crushed humans,
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.640]   a crushed savior in the care of souls."
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.240]   I'm not going to have time to read through that right now in our class, but I just encourage
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   you to read that.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:23.440]   That's one of the, Ernie Baker used to teach biblical counseling at the Master's University.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:30.920]   He is now the counseling pastor in Faith Church in Jacksonville or First Baptist Church in
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   Jacksonville.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.120]   And just a seasoned biblical counselor.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:43.000]   And he did a reflection there on the implications of Good Friday to the issues that he sees
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   in a counseling room.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.760]   It's just an excellent word of encouragement that relates the work of the son to the issues
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:57.600]   we face in our counseling ministry.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:04.160]   And then let me move to encouragement number three, which is on, I believe this is page
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:12.880]   five of your handout, that the spirit who bears witness to the son is our helper and
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.180]   our comforter.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:26.260]   So I can't think of a more discouraging ministry than to try to do counseling ministry apart
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.520]   from the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:35.080]   I mean, if it's just you and the counseling's problems, and all you've got is your power
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:42.040]   and your resources, then I say we should probably close up our counseling ministry because I
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:48.200]   can't think of a more discouraging ministry than to do that apart from the Holy Spirit's
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.920]   power.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.840]   But if we believe in the Holy Spirit, that it's the Holy Spirit who convicts, it's the
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:03.600]   Holy Spirit that brings understanding of the word to the counselee's life, it's the Holy
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:11.360]   Spirit that does a work of transforming and renewal and changing of the desires of a counselee's
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:18.760]   heart and we are given the fullness of the Holy Spirit's ministry that he lives in us
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:24.000]   and he bears his fruit in us and he empowers our ministry, then we can expect the Holy
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.560]   Spirit to do wonderful things in people's lives as we are faithful to minister his word.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:37.480]   And what that does is that it does take some of the pressure off.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:45.240]   I like John MacArthur's statement of he ministers in a state of relaxed desperation.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.300]   And I think that's a good way to put it.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:57.820]   There is a desperation in ministry because you are laboring and you are desiring that
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:03.960]   a life would be changed and you do understand what is at stake, but there's a relaxed desperation
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:10.880]   because you place yourself in the hands of the Holy Spirit and in the hands of the Savior
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:18.640]   and you trust that God is going to do a work for his glory as you're faithful to his word.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:25.840]   So this is a truth that brings encouragement to our lives.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.560]   So what I've given to you, I taught a theology class here at the church and we spent about
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:36.560]   four weeks looking at the doctrine of the Trinity and its implications for life and
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.240]   ministry and I've given you, this handout is basically a summary of those four weeks.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.000]   But I want to move to page number six and you can read a lot of that material on your
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.660]   own and hopefully that'll be a encouragement to you.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:59.760]   But I want to move to page number six because I know all of you are asking, this is all
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.240]   really good information, but how do I write my essay?
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.800]   Going back to the essay topic, what is a game plan to write this essay?
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.160]   So let's look at the question again.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:22.600]   The question is, explain the doctrine of the Trinity and provide its biblical basis.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:30.720]   So I think the best way to summarize the doctrine of the Trinity is Wayne Grudem's definition
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.560]   is probably the best thing out there.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.120]   I don't know how to improve upon it.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.600]   I think you would do well to quote that and footnote that is probably the most, the best
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.640]   summary statement of the doctrine of the Trinity and then he does a wonderful job walking through
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.160]   each of those affirmations.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.360]   But he writes there that we might define the doctrine of the Trinity as follows.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.880]   God eternally exists as three persons, father, son, and Holy Spirit, and each person is fully
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.040]   God and there is one God.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.520]   So we may define the doctrine of the Trinity as follows.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.800]   He has three affirmations there, which we'll walk through in a moment.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.580]   Number one, God eternally exists as three persons.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.720]   Number two, each person is fully God.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.200]   And number three, there is one God.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.720]   Those are three central affirmations that are at the heart of the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:38.560]   And if you deny any one of those affirmations, then you end up in theological error or what
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:45.500]   ACBC calls a fatal error in the grading of the essays.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:52.820]   So there are rewrites with the ACBC essays, and then there are what they call fatal errors.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:43:01.740]   And if you articulate an unorthodox view of the Trinity, then I'm sure that ACBC will
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.220]   award a fatal error.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.620]   None of the students in my classes have ever had that.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:13.140]   And so let's keep the record going there to keep us out of the fatal errors.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.740]   And this is one doctrine you want to be careful to explain and to affirm.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:24.700]   Those are just three central affirmations that are at the heart of an orthodox understanding
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.700]   of the Trinity.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.460]   So let's walk through them one by one.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:35.740]   The first affirmation is that God is three persons, three persons, not merely three modes
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.860]   or manifestations of one person.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:46.740]   That would be the theological error of modalism, which we want to be careful to guard against.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.500]   We believe that God is three persons.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:58.300]   The father is not the son, the son is not the spirit, and the spirit is not the father.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.020]   We see that in numerous texts of scripture.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:05.780]   John 17 verse one would be an example of that.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:10.900]   When Jesus has spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.540]   hour has come.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:16.260]   Glorify your son that the son may glorify you."
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:21.580]   And verse five says, "And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:25.340]   I had with you before the world existed."
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:35.220]   So the son, the son's prayers to the father do not make sense if the father is not a distinct
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.740]   person from the son.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:49.060]   And you have there a great Trinitarian passage, Matthew three, verse 16, which, by the way,
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.980]   would be an excellent passage to use in your essay.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:59.300]   If you want to see three persons of the Trinity in one scene, you can find that in Matthew
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:04.700]   three, verses 16 to 17, it says, "When Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.460]   the water and behold, the heavens were opened to him and he saw the spirit of God ascending
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.460]   like a dove and coming to rest on him.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:17.020]   And behold, a voice from heaven said, 'This is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased.'"
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:23.700]   So you see the son being baptized, you see the spirit descending, you see the father
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:30.660]   well pleased with the son and his perfect character.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:38.020]   In one passage, you have all three persons of the Trinity, three in oneness, three distinct
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:42.100]   persons, yet not three gods.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:48.100]   So God is three persons, you see in the middle of your handout that the son is not the spirit.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:55.020]   Acts four would be an example of how Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and as an
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:46:01.660]   expression of the Holy Spirit's influence and ministry, Peter boldly proclaimed the
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.380]   message of the son.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:08.980]   He boldly proclaimed the son's life, death, and resurrection because he was under the
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.220]   influence of the spirit.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:16.420]   And that's a great example for all of us in Christian ministry.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:23.220]   We want to be so filled with Holy Spirit that we are given a great love for the son and
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:31.540]   are given great boldness to minister the truth of Jesus Christ and the son's work.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:38.140]   And then you have at the bottom of page six that the spirit is not the father.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:45.460]   You see that in Romans 8, verse 26, it says, "Likewise, the spirit helps us in our weakness,
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:50.980]   for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the spirit himself intercedes for
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.620]   us with groanings too deep for words.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:59.300]   And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind and spirit because the spirit intercedes
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.300]   for the saints according to the will of God."
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:10.700]   So that passage would not make sense either if the spirit was not a distinct person from
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.980]   God, the father.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:21.740]   And so you have in throughout all of these great New Testament passages, the distinction
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:28.860]   made of three persons, the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.100]   Let me move to the next page on your handout.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:41.300]   This is page number seven and move to affirmation number two.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.260]   God is three persons was affirmation number one.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:48.220]   Affirmation number two is that each person is fully God.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.340]   Each person is fully God.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.620]   The father is fully God.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:48:01.620]   There's not much debate around that, Romans 1, verse seven, "He is the God and God our
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.540]   father.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:08.220]   Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.820]   And so the deity is ascribed to God, the father.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.940]   We see the son is fully God, John 1, verse one, "In the beginning was the word and the
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:20.980]   word was with God and the word was God."
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:26.020]   That is from the very beginning of John's gospel, ascribing deity to the person of Jesus
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.020]   Christ.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:31.300]   Titus 2, verse 13, "Waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.500]   God and savior, Jesus Christ."
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.940]   Another clear description of deity.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:44.820]   Thomas's great confession of faith in John 20, verse 28, "My Lord and my God."
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:51.660]   And those are just very clear statements ascribing deity to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:58.500]   You can also go through the information in Charles Ryrie's Basic Theology.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:03.420]   Divine names are ascribed to Christ, divine characteristics ascribed to Christ, divine
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.220]   titles are ascribed to Christ.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:11.380]   There's a whole wealth of information that you can bring to bear in supporting and in
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.060]   defending the deity of Christ.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:18.060]   But those are just some very clear statements there that are found in scripture.
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:23.780]   And then we have the spirit is also fully God.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.820]   Acts 5, verse three, "But Peter said, 'Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart?
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:33.020]   To lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.580]   You have not lied to men, but to God.'"
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:42.180]   So to lie to the Holy Spirit is to lie to God.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:49.420]   And then we see these great Trinitarian formulations and expressions at the bottom of page seven.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:54.300]   Matthew 28, verse 19, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.460]   the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:07.380]   Those formulations would be blasphemous if the Holy Spirit was not fully God and co-equal
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:12.100]   with the Father and the Son.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:17.140]   But the spirit is also fully God.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:21.740]   So that is the second affirmation that is at the heart of this doctrine.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:27.100]   And then the third affirmation is there are not three gods, but one God, Deuteronomy 6,
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:31.860]   verse four, "Hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:38.780]   And so we have three in oneness, triunity or trinity.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:46.780]   Now Charles Ryrie, that is, has stated that no illustration can possibly capture all that
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.620]   is involved in the biblical revelation of the Trinity.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.300]   Most are at best only parallels of a three-in-one idea.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:51:00.460]   And yet he gives this illustration, which is kind of a common diagram that attempts
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.940]   to picture the Godhead as one.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:08.860]   And you can find this picture in Ryrie's Basic Theology, but it's showing how each person,
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:12.140]   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is God.
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:19.980]   And yet how each person is distinct from the other persons of the Trinity.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:29.020]   And so that is probably the best attempt at capturing in an illustration the doctrine
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.060]   of the Trinity.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:38.100]   So how do we get into trouble for a few moments here at the end of this presentation?
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.580]   How do we get in trouble with the doctrine of the Trinity?
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:45.260]   How do we veer into theological error?
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:51.540]   Well, a great way to think about it is just what happens when you deny any one of those
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.420]   three affirmations.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:52:00.100]   So let's say that you deny the first affirmation that God is three persons, and you end up
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:06.940]   with this idea that God is one person who manifests himself in three different ways
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.340]   or three different modes.
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:14.260]   You end up with a theological error known as modalism.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:19.460]   Modalism says that God is one person who manifests himself in three different ways.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:29.380]   So it's like how a man would be at the same time a father, a farmer, and a neighbor.
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:36.740]   And so he would show himself or express himself in society in three different modes or manifestations,
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:39.580]   but he is only one person.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:45.220]   That would be the theological error of modalism.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:53.220]   Modalism has also been called Sabellianism, named after one of the promoters of this idea
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.820]   in early church history.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:59.580]   It's also known as modalistic monarchianism.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:04.660]   And Wayne Grudem does a good job in his systematic theology dealing with those terms.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:12.140]   But they're basically the same idea that God is not three distinct persons.
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:17.980]   Stephen Nichols has written that modalism is a heretical view that denies the individual
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.260]   persons of the Trinity.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:25.180]   It views biblical terminology of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as merely modes
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:30.140]   of existence or manifestations of the one God.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:36.220]   And he continues that modalism held that there is one God who can be designated by three
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.900]   different names, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit at different times, but these are not distinct
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   persons.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:46.900]   Instead, they are different modes, thus modalism of the one God.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.340]   Thus, according to modalism, God can be called Father.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:55.740]   As creator of the world and lawgiver, he can be called Son, as God incarnate in Jesus Christ,
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.380]   and he can be called Holy Spirit, as God in the church age.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:05.380]   Accordingly, Jesus Christ is God and the Spirit is God, but they are not distinct persons.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:16.320]   So that's one theological error that arises from the fact that you deny the first affirmation.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.420]   You end up in modalism.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:24.980]   Let's move to a second theological error, and that's Arianism, named after a bishop
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:31.820]   of Alexandria in the early fourth century, Arius.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:41.500]   Arius taught that God the Son was a created being, and so he denied the full deity of
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.580]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.180]   As Wayne Grudem explains, Arius taught that God the Son was at one point created by God
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:51.420]   the Father, and that before that time, the Son did not exist, nor did the Holy Spirit,
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.420]   but the Father only.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:57.060]   Thus, though the Son is a heavenly being who existed before the rest of creation and who
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:01.500]   is far greater than all the rest of creation, he is still not equal to the Father in all
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.500]   his attributes.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.860]   He may even be said to be like the Father or similar to the Father in his nature, but
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:12.380]   he cannot be said to be of the same nature as the Father.
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:19.620]   So the dispute really rose in Arius' time between the two Greek words homoousios, which
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:27.020]   means of the same nature, and homoousios, of a similar nature, and you notice that there's
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:32.540]   only one letter that distinguishes those two words.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:38.740]   Arius was happy to say that Christ was of a similar nature as the Father, that Christ
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:44.420]   was created by God before the creation of the rest of the universe, but he did not want
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:52.780]   to confess that Christ was of the same nature as the Father, and the difference between
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:56:01.980]   the two words was the presence or absence of that Greek letter iota, and it marked the
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:07.380]   difference between biblical Christianity and a heresy that denied the full deity of
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.020]   Jesus Christ.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:17.300]   The Nicene Creed in A.D. 325 condemned the views of Arius and used the word homoousios,
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:25.180]   being of one substance as the Father, in formulating an orthodox understanding of the deity of
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:33.540]   Christ, and in order to refute Arianism, you need to, I mean, you can easily refute it
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:38.820]   by the numerous texts of Scripture which set forth the full deity of Jesus Christ in the
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:39.820]   New Testament.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:44.780]   So you have, if you deny the first one, you have modalism, you deny the second one, you
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:52.700]   have Arianism, and you deny a third statement, you have tritheism or polytheism, which ends
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:57:00.660]   up that you have three persons and you have three gods, and that would deny clear statements
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:06.860]   such as Deuteronomy 6, as we just mentioned, that there is one God.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:15.380]   And so a good essay on this subject would, I mean, a good game plan is to go through
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:23.300]   the three affirmations and explain your understanding of how God is three persons, the Father is
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.960]   not the Son, the Son is not the Spirit, the Spirit is not the Father, and then just give
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:33.100]   biblical texts that support the reasons why you would distinguish between an understanding
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:37.820]   of God the Father and God the Son and God the Spirit.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:47.020]   You would do well to do an essay, a paragraph on the second affirmation in defending the
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:53.860]   biblical understanding of each person is fully God, and defending the deity of the Father,
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:59.300]   deity of the Son, and the deity of the Holy Spirit through texts of Scripture, and there
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:06.500]   are many texts of Scripture that you can use to defend each of those assertions.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:11.700]   And then a third affirmation, there are not three gods but one God, that would be worthy
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:21.660]   of a third paragraph there, of just the oneness of God, the unity part of the triunity, and
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:31.620]   that there are not a multiplicity of gods, but there is one true and living God.
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:39.260]   And then you would do well to do a brief overview of where you end up with, how do you end up
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:49.140]   in theological error, modalism, Arianism, polytheism, and just note what happens when
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:53.220]   you deny these affirmations.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:58.420]   If you have further room, if you're still looking for things to write about, I would
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:04.100]   encourage you to do a paragraph on how does that impact counseling, how does that change
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:09.980]   your counseling ministry and practice, and what are some implications of how you would
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.580]   use that in counseling ministry.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:20.820]   Okay, well, I am out of time, so what I'm going to do is I am going to close this in
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:25.260]   prayer, and you're free to go, but I'm going to hang on for about, you know, five or ten
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.260]   minutes.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.420]   If you have any questions, I'll be happy to hang on and answer any questions, but I want
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:35.540]   to be respectful of your time and let you go if you need to get to dinner or have some
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.540]   plans.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.180]   So let me pray for us and close our time.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.420]   Father, thank you for the truth of who you are.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:52.060]   We just praise you and thank you for this glorious truth that of the blessed trinity,
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:58.820]   God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, yet not three gods, one God, blessed
[00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:59.820]   trinity.
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:03.380]   We just praise you at the wonder of who you are.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:09.500]   Pray that we would read our Bibles, understanding the distinct roles and relationships that
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:14.700]   exist between the persons of the trinity, and Lord, that we would be able to use the
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.940]   truth of Scripture to encourage others.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:22.100]   We thank you for the work of your Son, we thank you for the ministry of your Spirit,
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.100]   and just bless each person.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.660]   Thank you for their faithfulness in joining us tonight.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:30.540]   Bless each person, we pray, and give them a great week writing this essay.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.860]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.860]   Amen.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.380]   Okay, well, I'll hang on for a little bit.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:41.140]   If you have any questions, feel free to use the chat function or the Q&A statement, but
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:48.060]   otherwise, Lord bless you, and thanks so much for being with us tonight.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:57.020]   Okay, question came in, "Can we still pass this essay if we don't mention the implications
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.740]   of the trinity in biblical counseling, but strictly focus on laying out the doctrine
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.460]   of the trinity?"
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:11.100]   Yes, you can pass this essay if you've got plenty of material there to write about.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.580]   If you just hit those three assertions and then the theological errors, that should get
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.460]   you to a page, page and a half.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:24.260]   If you still have some room to fill, then go ahead and mention some implications for
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.260]   counseling.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:30.160]   But I mentioned, I spent a lot of time on implications for counseling tonight because
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.260]   I found that students tend to approach this essay just more as kind of a theological test
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:40.740]   and just wanting to get the orthodox statements down, and I'm always trying to get you to
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:48.300]   think through, "Okay, how would these essays impact your counseling practice in real life?"
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.860]   Because if your theology doesn't make a transition to the actual ministry that you're doing,
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:58.700]   then I don't think we've accomplished what we want to with these essays.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:04.900]   So great question, excellent.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.660]   Another question came in, "How can we access prior class sessions?"
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:16.860]   So all of the prior class sessions are available on YouTube format, and if you need those links,
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:23.080]   email counseling@kinderchurch.org and Jacqueline Hernandez will get you those links.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:28.200]   So those should have been sent out every week, or we're trying to send that out every week
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.740]   in case you can't make it on a Sunday night, but you're welcome to access those.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:38.380]   The first two classes, we had technical problems.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:44.460]   Well, I had technical problems because I run my own tech for Sunday night, so we didn't
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:49.580]   get the recordings for the first two sessions, but the rest of the session should be available.
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:52.500]   Great question.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.800]   Then a question came in, "Can we still pass if we don't mention the different wrong views
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.900]   of the Trinity?"
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:11.040]   So you may be able to pass, but I would encourage you to, at least in a brief summary statement,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:20.620]   mention what happens if you end up not affirming certain statements or truths about the Trinity.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.180]   I think that would be a good, well-rounded essay.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.700]   I think the counseling implications would be a bonus, but I think a good, like an A
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:37.220]   essay would mention some aspect of what happens, how do you end up in theological error with
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:42.980]   the Trinity, because there has been so much theological error in church history on this
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:49.980]   doctrine, and that would just give the reader an understanding that you understand this
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:59.360]   doctrine well enough to defend it from error or from wrong views.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.180]   Great question.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:05.460]   Okay, any other questions or anything else I can help you guys with?
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:12.920]   I hope you're doing well with the essays and that you're able to continue to work through
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.180]   and pressing on.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.820]   We have another question came in, "What do we do with Christophanes or Theophanes?"
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:20.820]   Great question.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:26.900]   Like, when Jacob wrestles with God, I don't think I can fully understand the Trinity even
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.140]   if I had years to study it.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.180]   That's a great response.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:39.100]   I feel the same way, that I cannot fully understand the Trinity, and I probably will never in
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:42.180]   this life fully understand the Trinity.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:53.780]   I think that goes back to our understanding of God is incomprehensible, yet He is understandable.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:05:00.680]   So there is an aspect of God can never fully be understood because He is infinite and beyond
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:08.980]   our understanding, but that does not mean we cannot understand true things about God,
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:17.420]   and I will never fully understand the Trinity, yet I can understand true things about the
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.180]   triune God and His nature.
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:25.460]   And so I appreciate that statement.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:33.260]   I would just kind of give the balancing truth of please be humbled by the greatness of the
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:36.140]   mystery of the doctrine of the Trinity.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:42.380]   That's a good place to be, but don't let that keep you from also stating true things about
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:47.740]   the doctrine of the Trinity as found in God's Word because I do believe that we can do that
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.360]   and we should do that.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:58.800]   Regarding Christophanes or Theophanes, that is a study that is well worth your attention,
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.700]   you know, the Christophanes in the Old Testament.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:08.460]   I would think that might be beyond the scope of writing a page and a half on the doctrine
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:09.580]   of the Trinity.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:18.900]   I think you've got enough information that's there that will help you with that without
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:24.220]   going into the Christophanes, and I think there's enough information there that you
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:31.020]   probably need to wrestle through without opening that subject, although it is a wonderful study
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:36.100]   and I encourage you to do that if you have time for that.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:43.420]   Okay, one last question was the name of the book by Ernie Baker.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:47.460]   What was the name of the book by Ernie Baker you mentioned?
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:52.380]   So I actually gave you Ernie Baker's statement.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.700]   I have put that in your Dropbox folder.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:00.140]   Ernie Baker, I think he wrote that as a Facebook post.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:06.860]   It was just his reflections, it's not a published work, but it's phenomenal and I've used that
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:12.220]   in some of my classes and many people have appreciated his reflections on Good Friday
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:17.100]   and how that ties into counseling ministry.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:22.940]   And I think we do oftentimes make a big deal about Good Friday and Easter, but don't do
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:29.780]   enough work in tying together the central events of Good Friday and Easter to, okay,
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:34.420]   how does that apply to my marriage or how does that apply to how I handle my finances
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:39.180]   or how I relate to my kids or how I handle my anger problem?
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:43.740]   And that's the work that I think Ernie Baker is trying to do in tying together, okay, now
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:48.620]   that we're celebrating Good Friday, how does that impact all of these issues that we're
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:49.860]   seeing in counseling ministry?
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.380]   And he does a phenomenal job with that.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:57.020]   So I think you'll be blessed by that and reading that Facebook post, which I just turned into
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:00.380]   a handout.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.300]   Okay, wonderful.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   Okay, the Bruce Ware book, the question came in, maybe the question that was referred to
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   was the Bruce Ware book that I mentioned.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:28.460]   Yes, Bruce Ware has a book called Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Roles and Relationships.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.980]   And maybe I'll send you that link.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:36.100]   It's out of print, I believe, and so it'll cost you a little bit if you want to get it
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.100]   off Amazon.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.540]   I think you're going to have to pay a little bit extra to get that.
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:48.940]   If somebody finds a way to get that in any other form, I have that on my bookshelf, and
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:53.700]   it was one of the most helpful things that I could read in terms of not just understanding
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:57.060]   the Trinity, but how does this impact my life?
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.080]   Why should I understand the doctrine of the Trinity?
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.420]   How does this make a difference in how I do family life and church life?
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.280]   And he does a phenomenal job in there.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.180]   So I'll do some work on that and see if that's available, and maybe if you could research
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.080]   that as well.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:19.100]   But right now it's out of print, and I think the only thing, only way you can get it is
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:25.180]   by looking at a used book resource, which maybe they have them on eBay or something
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:27.180]   like that.
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.820]   Okay, well, wonderful.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:31.820]   God bless you all.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.500]   Thank you so much for your faithfulness and for being a part of this class.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:39.660]   It's a great encouragement, and it's a great joy to be able to have this time with you
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.660]   to study God's Word.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.580]   I hope you have a blessed week.
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:49.100]   We'll be gathering next Sunday at 5 o'clock p.m. Pacific time, and we'll go through essay
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.460]   number eight in the theology exams.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:55.140]   And until then, have a great week, and may the Lord bless you.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.140]   Amen.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.140]   Amen.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:57.140]   Amen.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:07.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
