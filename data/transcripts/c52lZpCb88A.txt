[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.240]   the book of the Prophet Jeremiah, the seventeenth chapter and the eleventh verse.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.960]   The eleventh verse in the seventeenth chapter of the book of the Prophet Jeremiah.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:28.960]   As the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth riches, and not
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:40.640]   by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   As the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth riches, and not
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:01:00.840]   by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.160]   Now those of us who meet regularly here have been considering the message of this seventeenth
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.600]   chapter of the book of the Prophet Jeremiah for a number of Sunday evenings.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.360]   And we have been doing so because we have shown to us here so clearly the terrible,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.240]   devastating effects upon the human race of sin and evil.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.320]   That is the whole point of the Prophet's message.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.520]   He was sent to the children of Israel at a time of terrible crisis in their lives.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.960]   Things could not very well have been much worse.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.400]   But there was worse to follow unless they repented.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.580]   So God sent this servant of His, as he had sent so many servants before him, with a message
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.320]   to these people, to face the facts, ere it was too late.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.800]   And what the message is in its essence is to put before them the two possibilities,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.520]   the only two possibilities, which are always there before us.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.800]   The possibility of either being blessed by God, or else the other dread possibility of
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.480]   cursing.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.520]   This was put to the children of Israel in order that they might see that all their troubles
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.760]   arose from the fact that they had wandered away from God.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.840]   They could not see that, they did not believe that, but that nevertheless was the fact and
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.360]   that was the truth.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.920]   The Prophet therefore is sent to them with this burning message, appealing to them, ere
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.520]   it be too late, to repent and to return to God.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.960]   Such is the love and mercy of God that he puts the message to us simply, plainly, directly,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.800]   in pictures, using illustrations, so plainly that all of us will be left without any excuse
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.440]   if at the end we find ourselves under God's wrath and under God's curse.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.360]   Now the essence of the message is this, that man is in his present predicament because
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.880]   of the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.600]   Now we have seen that here in this notable verse, the ninth verse, where we are told
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.520]   the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.120]   Who can know it?
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.380]   Now that is something that is often said in the Bible about sin.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.000]   You noticed it in that reading just now from the third chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.180]   It is the deceitfulness of sin that always causes the trouble.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.120]   You see the author of that epistle writing to those people says, "Now don't be misled
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.920]   as your forefathers were in the wilderness.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920]   They had a marvellous opportunity.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.740]   God had called them and had delivered them out of the captivity and the bondage of Egypt
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.140]   and he was leading them to a promised land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.920]   But very few of the original people who came out of Egypt actually went into Canaan.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.120]   Why?
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.040]   Well the answer is, he said, "They were deceived."
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.120]   It was because of the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.240]   Sin is something that deceives us and we have already considered some of the ways in which
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.800]   it does so.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.120]   Now I say this is a constantly recurring theme in the whole of the Bible.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.160]   Take for instance the way the Apostle Paul puts it in writing to the Corinthians in his
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.560]   second epistle and in the eleventh chapter.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.680]   He talks about the serpent at the beginning, "beguiling Eve."
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.520]   It is the same thing, beguiling, appearing as a would-be friend, appearing most ingratiating,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.080]   most pleasant, most able, most affable, out to help, out to be a great friend.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.560]   "Beguiled Eve," says the Apostle Paul.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.400]   In other words, deceived her, persuaded her to do something that was wrong without her
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.440]   realizing what was happening.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.480]   Now that is something, then, I say that is constantly emphasized in the Scriptures, the
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.240]   deceitfulness of sin.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.080]   But there is another term that is used very frequently in the Scriptures with regard to
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.460]   sin.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.760]   And the second one is folly, foolishness.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.960]   The sinner, according to the Bible, is above everything else a fool, nothing less than
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.640]   a fool.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.240]   And here again is something, I say, that you will find running right through the Scripture.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.280]   The Bible, of course, is a book which God has given to us in order to teach us and to
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.360]   instruct us.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.160]   There is nothing which is so foolish as to think of the Bible as a book that is remote
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   from life, that has nothing to tell us and nothing to help us as we struggle daily with
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.620]   life in this world as it is.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.800]   The people who think that the Bible is a book which is only of interest to those who have
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   got nothing better to do or who are so ignorant that they do not know of great literature
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   and so on, oh, what terrible ignorance that is.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.920]   There is no more practical book in the world than this.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.800]   It is a book about life.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.320]   It is a book about living.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.640]   That is why it has got so much history.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.000]   That is why it tells us so much about wars and births and marriages and deaths and the
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.960]   trials and troubles of individuals and of nations.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.120]   It is a book of life, written about men and women who are in this world and trying to
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.640]   live, written to such people in order to help them.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:04.240]   And this is its great message, that all our troubles, I say again, are due to sin.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:11.560]   And what sin does to us is to make us unutterably foolish.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:19.920]   It not only deceives us, but it fools us, and it makes fools of us.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.600]   And here, you see, in this verse that we are looking at tonight, we have the two ideas
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.520]   brought together.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.440]   In this one verse, the two main things that the Bible has to tell us about sin are combined
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.840]   together in one picture.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:43.280]   Now, you notice that it is put in the form of an analogy or an illustration.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:53.960]   As in the same way as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, so as so he
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.480]   that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.160]   his end shall be a fool.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:10.120]   Now, the authorities are in great trouble over this illustration about the partridge.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.160]   The text is not too clear, so we cannot tell exactly what it really means.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.400]   They have got two main ideas about it.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:26.480]   Some say that it means that the partridge takes eggs out of other nests and then puts
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.240]   them in her own nest and tries to hatch them.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.800]   Others say no, that what it really means is this, that the partridge has a habit of taking
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:42.680]   the young birds that have just been hatched out of the eggs of other birds and takes them
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.240]   to herself and tries to bring them up as her family.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.480]   And then, of course, the time comes when the bird has grown to a stage where it hears the
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.520]   call of its rightful mother and the type to which it belongs and runs away from the partridge.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.160]   The partridge thought that it was being very clever.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.960]   It was, as it were, having an offspring with a minimum amount of effort.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.840]   Whether it was collecting eggs from another nest or taking the young birds from another
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.580]   nest, the partridge thought it had done something very wonderful, that it had got this wonderful
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.440]   family without the effort, but suddenly the other one calls and away they run and the
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.280]   poor partridge is left without a family at all.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.480]   Well, we cannot tell, I say, which of the two explanations is correct.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.480]   It seems that partridges in this country are not guilty of either practice.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.200]   However, I am no more interested probably in that than you are.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:47.240]   But it is quite clear that there is some basis to this idea that is here used by the Prophet.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:53.740]   There was some habit of these birds which led him to use this as an illustration.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:01.960]   But as I say, whatever the precise meaning, the lesson and the message is perfectly clear
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.560]   and distinct.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:13.440]   The message is that any man, all men as sinners, are guilty of precisely the same thing.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.940]   Now you notice that the Prophet puts it in particular in terms of riches, in terms of
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.940]   getting wealth.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:30.600]   So he says, "He that getteth riches, wealth, but not by right, shall leave them in the
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:38.000]   midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.200]   Now then, here I say our two ideas are blended together.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.360]   And what the Prophet does is to take just one illustration, a very common one.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.480]   But it does not only apply to this question of wealth.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   It applies to anything else on which a man sets his heart in the same way.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:07.360]   Indeed, it is a general denunciation, as I have indicated, of sin as a whole, which manifests
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.200]   itself so commonly in this very matter of wealth.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.120]   But this coveting of wealth is not the only sin.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.200]   This amassing wealth by an illegitimate method is not the only sin.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.760]   Anything that man does according to that principle applies in exactly the same way.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.280]   In these ancient times, wealth was one of the commonest forms which sin took, and it
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.560]   is equally true today.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   Theft, robbery, keeping money which does not belong to you, that sort of thing.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.840]   That is the kind of thing that the Prophet was using as his primary illustration.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:58.640]   What matters is the great principle of this whole attitude towards life.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.160]   And therefore, let me put it to you in the form of a number of principles.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.800]   There are two main lessons it seems to me taught us here.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:16.680]   The first is that we must understand something of the ways in which man deceives himself.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.440]   Now we have already dealt with that in general in the ninth verse.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.800]   I am going to deal with it now in particular as it is put before us in this eleventh verse.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.240]   How does man deceive himself?
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:35.680]   Well, the commonest way of all is that he deceives himself with regard to his own wisdom,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:44.040]   with regard to his own ability, with regard to his own understanding.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:55.360]   I do not think I need hesitate in asserting that this is the essential thing in sin.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:03.720]   I say it is the essential thing in sin for this reason, that it was the precise form
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:11.880]   in which the devil tempted Adam and Eve at the very beginning.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.240]   He with all his cleverness and his subtlety knew that the point at which he was most likely
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:24.040]   to persuade men to agree with him rather than with God was along the line of the intellect,
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.160]   the mind.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:33.040]   And therefore, you see, he came to them and he said, "Now look here.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.320]   Do you notice that God has told you not to eat in particular of that tree of the knowledge
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.360]   of good and evil?
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.560]   Don't you see what it means?
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.960]   He says God is insulting you.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.120]   God is withholding this knowledge from you.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:56.800]   God is insulting your intellects, your minds, your understanding."
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.040]   And that was the thing that produced man's downfall.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.240]   I have no doubt that the sin of sins is intellectual pride.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.800]   It has been the cause of man's trouble from the very beginning and it continues the same
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.720]   until this very night.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.800]   Man is always confident of his own intellect and his own power.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:28.560]   He always holds the view that he really has nothing to do but to sit down and to think
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:35.960]   and to work things out and that as the result of so doing, he can master any problem, he
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.680]   can solve all difficulties, and he can live life as it should be lived, and he can make
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.400]   the world what he would like it to be.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.360]   Now I must not weary you with this.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.320]   I am constantly referring to it because it seems to me to be particularly the sin of
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.280]   the twentieth century.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:01.360]   It began, of course, in the last century and we have received the legacy and it is continuing.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.800]   Men about the middle of the last century began to develop this idea.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.240]   It can be put in a nutshell, as it were, if I put it like this.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:21.200]   In general, until then, man was aware of his smallness and his inability and he came to
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.000]   the Bible as God's Word in order to receive guidance.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.920]   He believed it was inspired, that it was a revelation of God and his thought and his
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.840]   ideas about life.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.040]   But about that time, men began to reject that and he put up in its place what is called
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   philosophy.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.800]   And what is philosophy?
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.640]   Well philosophy simply means this.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:54.480]   It is man's claim that by his own thought and his reasoning and his analysis and his
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.060]   synthesis he can arrive at a complete knowledge about life.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.800]   It is man's assertion that he is self-sufficient, that he has got the brain and the intellectual
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:13.240]   capacity to understand everything, and that even God himself is someone whom he is capable
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.760]   of analyzing and dissecting.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.040]   Man asserts his own mind and his own brain.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.720]   That is the real meaning of philosophy.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:32.120]   And when you put philosophy in the first position, you are asserting your intellectual self-sufficiency.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:39.400]   And surely that is the essential trouble with men.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.080]   Let me put it to you in this form.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.920]   Why is it that the whole world tonight, in view of the world's situation and in view
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:54.560]   of all that is so true of life, why is it that the whole world is not on its knees at
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:01.000]   this moment, praying to God and pleading with him to have mercy and to show us the way out
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   of our difficulties?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.480]   There is only one answer.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:11.780]   It is that man is confident still that he is capable of dealing with the situation.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:18.320]   He feels that to go down on his knees and to ask God for help is insulting to man.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:26.480]   He feels that he can do it himself, that his own mind, I say, is sufficiently great.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.520]   That is always the essential trouble with men.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:37.560]   Confident in his own ideas, in his own thoughts, in his own proposals, and in his own schemes.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.620]   Now that is the thing that Jeremiah, you see, has got in his mind.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.260]   He is picturing to us a man, this man who getteth riches but not by right.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.740]   What is the truth about this man?
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:57.980]   Well, here is a man, obviously, who thinks that he is rather clever.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.700]   You see, he sees certain people sweating and laboring, and he says, "What fools!
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.300]   There is no need to do that.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.260]   I know how to do it," and he does it in his way.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.220]   The first thing that he proclaims is that he is a very clever man.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:18.060]   It is very obvious in the case of a man who does this with regard to wealth, isn't it?
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.340]   But how tragically blind we all are to see that it is equally true of all of us with
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.740]   regard to life and living.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.100]   Never has man thought so highly of himself and his own cleverness and his own ability
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.380]   as he does today.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.980]   The average man who is not a Christian feels rather sorry for those of us who are Christians.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.600]   My friends, you know full well that there are millions of people in the world tonight
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.940]   who would think that all of us in this building at this moment are fools, that we should still
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:53.900]   be meeting in a place of worship and listening to an exposition of the Bible and singing
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.540]   hymns and praying to God.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.040]   They say, "What?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   Still doing that?
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.600]   They are much too clever to do that."
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:09.980]   You see, like this man, like the partridge, man in sin thinks that he is clever, he has
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.540]   got great confidence in his own cleverness.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:21.440]   And man, I say tonight, if he is not a Christian, is a man who believes that he is so clever
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.580]   that he can solve all his problems, master all his difficulties, and make of himself
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.060]   and of life in this world what he wants it to be.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.860]   That is the first thing I find here.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.580]   Yes, but there is a second thing.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.260]   Man not only deceives himself with regard to his own cleverness and his own ability,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:50.060]   he tends also to deceive himself always in this way, that he feels that he can ignore
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:58.380]   the law and that he can break the rules with impunity.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.180]   Now we are carrying two ideas in our minds, aren't we?
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.260]   That man in sin is deceived and also a fool.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:13.140]   And I am trying to show you how the two elements come out in this second way, that man thinks
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:19.580]   that he can ignore all the rules and break all the laws and still, to use the modern
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.220]   phrase, get away with it.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.380]   That is what the partridge thought, wasn't it?
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.940]   Take those eggs, take those young, wonderful, clever, be all right.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.940]   What had she forgotten?
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.900]   She had forgotten the instinct in the little animals, in the little birds.
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.780]   They hear the cry of the real parent and off they run.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:47.260]   The partridge was very clever, yes, but he had forgotten the law of nature, the law of
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.540]   kind, the law of species and all the rest of it.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.660]   There is this affinity and it will assert itself.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.580]   But the partridge ignored that and believed, of course, that it could be done quite safely
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.580]   and that she, the partridge, could get away with it.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.020]   Well now, man, according to the prophet and according to the Bible everywhere, is guilty
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.020]   of the same thing.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:13.060]   Here is a man, you see, who getteth riches, becomes enormously wealthy, but not by right.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.580]   He has broken the rules, he has broken the law.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.140]   Ah, but he is a clever fellow and where others can't do it, he can do it and he is sure
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:26.380]   he can do it and off he goes and tries to do it.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.460]   But that is true of every one of us, according to the Bible.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:39.100]   We will persist in thinking that we can do things in our own way, that we can disobey
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.460]   God, that we can ignore his holy laws, that we can spit upon the sanctities and still
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.100]   everything will be all right with us.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:54.740]   Now, let me put it in a more explicit form by putting it like this.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.100]   There is a statement here in the Old Testament that puts it like this.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:05.700]   It says, "The way of the transgressor is hard."
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.220]   Hard.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:14.100]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.140]   But does mankind believe that?
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.060]   If mankind believed that, nobody would ever sin again.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.500]   You see, what we all say is this, "Oh, well, of course, that man got into trouble.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.820]   I shan't get into trouble.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.820]   Of course, he was a fool.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.820]   He didn't know how to do it.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.820]   I know.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.380]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.140]   Well, of course, it may have been at one time, but it is no longer like that.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.420]   We have advanced since then and we know so much more and so on.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.420]   I can do it.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.180]   There is no risk as far as I am concerned.
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.860]   The way of the transgressor is hard, says the rule.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.220]   I say, not a bit of it.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.820]   I know how to do it in such a way that I shall not suffer as a result of doing it.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.260]   You see, the law is there, but I take no notice of the law.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.900]   "Getteth riches, but not by right."
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:03.580]   He crashes through the laws and breaks all the sanctities and still is assured that there
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.900]   will be no trouble as far as he is concerned.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.500]   Or let me give you another example.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.540]   There is a great fundamental law in life, says the Bible, and it says it in the Old
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.460]   Testament and in the New Testament and goes on repeating it.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:28.660]   "What a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.660]   It's a law.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.660]   "Put in wheat, wheat will come up.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.340]   Put in oats, it will be oats.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.660]   What a man soweth, that also shall he reap."
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.140]   Now this is an absolute law.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.100]   There is no variation at all.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:54.660]   It is one of those eternal laws of nature that God has put there.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.940]   But you see, this kind of man ignores that.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:04.900]   He is not interested in this instinct in the birds, this affinity, this call of like to
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.020]   like, this family tie.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.980]   He is not interested in these laws in nature, in any form.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.380]   He is convinced that he can manipulate it all and still be all right.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:24.260]   Isn't this the whole explanation of all misery and unhappiness in the world this evening?
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:32.060]   What a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:37.100]   If you sow to the spirit, you shall reap of the spirit everlasting life.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:44.540]   If you sow to the flesh, you shall reap of the flesh corruption.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.980]   It is an absolute law.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:53.420]   But I say men in sin don't believe that.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.340]   We are confronted by the evidence not only in the Bible, but you get it in the whole
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.940]   story of the human race.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:08.900]   Read the biographies, read your history books, your secular history books, and you will find
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:14.580]   that these laws that govern life, these rules that govern the conduct of humanity, they
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.140]   are absolutes.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.500]   And though very clever men have stood up against them and have tried to break them, in the
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:25.860]   last analysis, they all are proofs of the fact that what the Bible says is absolutely
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:33.420]   true without any exception at all.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:38.020]   But man doesn't recognize that, does he?
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:43.440]   He refuses to believe that he's been made in the image of God.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.820]   He refuses to believe that God has put certain laws in his nature and that unless he obeys
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.180]   them, he's going to suffer.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.300]   He laughs at them all.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.700]   He does it in every respect, he does it physically.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.580]   You see, there are men who think that they are strong enough to play fast and loose with
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.060]   the laws of health.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.980]   I've known such men.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.180]   They've laughed at them, they've defied them.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.060]   They've said that they're so strong that they need pay no attention to these things.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.400]   But they've lived to see their folly.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:20.700]   If you burn both ends of the candle, it won't last long.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:26.020]   If you spend your day in making money and your night and into the small hours of the
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:32.660]   morning in spending it again on your lusts and passions, you'll pay for it.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.660]   Your blood pressure will go up, your arteries will harden.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.820]   It's no use talking to me about your vitality and how perhaps you've got some drugs that
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.580]   you can take that keep you going.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.900]   All right, live on your drugs, but the whole time a secret record is being kept and the
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.220]   result is being recorded and you'll know it eventually.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.500]   These are absolute laws.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.300]   And they're true above everywhere in the spiritual realm.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:09.820]   God has made men for himself and he has told us so plainly, "There is no peace, saith
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.340]   my God, to the wicked."
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.180]   And yet wicked people are still convinced they can find peace and happiness and joy.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.460]   That's why they plunge into sin.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.900]   They've read the story of others.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.260]   They see the account of them in the newspapers.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.260]   The man starts drinking.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.780]   He says, "Ah," somebody tells him, "Be careful, you may end in a drunkard's grave."
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:32.160]   "Not I," he says, "I can do it."
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.700]   We all think that we are the exceptions, that we can afford to break the rules.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.500]   He getteth riches but not by right.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:45.700]   Like the partridge, he disobeys the laws of nature and thinks it's going to be a success.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.780]   Well, which brings me to my third point which I put in this form.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:55.100]   That man in this way believes that he is looking after himself and his own highest and his
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.860]   best interests.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:06.700]   And nowhere are the elements of deceit and folly seen so clearly than at this very point.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.700]   The partridge does all that as I've indicated to you, thinking it's doing the best for
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.460]   itself.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.660]   And so does man in sin.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:24.020]   No man sets out to be miserable or to be unhappy.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:29.740]   Everybody is seeking happiness and peace and joy.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:35.060]   And this is the supreme folly and tragedy of men tonight.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:41.580]   That men and women, by turning their backs upon God, by spitting upon his laws, by trampling
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:47.620]   upon the sanctities, are rarely convinced and persuade themselves that they're serving
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.860]   their own highest and best interests.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.540]   That they're rarely doing a good thing for themselves.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:01.340]   That's why the man, you see, takes money but not according to righteousness.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.300]   He thinks he's doing a very good thing for himself.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.700]   Get rich quickly.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.520]   Get rich without all the effort and the sweat and the labor.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.620]   Do it in a subtle way.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.260]   Use your mind and your brain.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.180]   Don't be a fool and do it in the ordinary way.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:20.020]   He's thinking he's doing a marvelous thing for himself.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:24.940]   But you see what the Bible has to say about it all.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.940]   You see how man is proclaiming his folly in doing this very thing.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.140]   What an idea he has of himself.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:41.380]   Look at this sort of man who gets rich quickly but not by right.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:48.380]   You see what he tells us about his estimate of himself and his estimate of life?
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.380]   To him that he's a thief and a robber and a liar is nothing.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.000]   Character doesn't count.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.340]   It's money that counts.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.660]   If I have become a multimillionaire as a result of my dishonesty, well, it's wonderful.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.740]   The fact I've lost my character is to a man like that nothing at all.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.180]   It's money that counts.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:14.100]   And the power that money gives and the ability to buy things with money, that's his estimate
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.260]   of a man, you see.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.860]   That's his estimate of life and nobility and character.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.860]   And he thinks he's clever.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.100]   He thinks he's wonderful.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.300]   He thinks he's paying himself a great compliment.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.780]   He pats himself on the back.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.060]   He says, "Marvelous.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.380]   You've done gloriously.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.100]   What a success you are in life."
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   Or think of it, if you like, in terms of pleasure and people who live for pleasure and what
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:50.620]   they call happiness and joy.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:55.180]   I don't read Sunday newspapers but sometimes they're put so prominently before you that
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.180]   you can't help seeing them.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:03.740]   I gather that a man's going to write an account of his life story.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:11.940]   I saw a title, "He Puts Love Before Profession" or something.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:17.460]   How we sentimentalize about these things.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.500]   Happiness is put before honor today.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.780]   And as long as you can find a certain amount of happiness, as the modern man, honor doesn't
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.780]   count.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.620]   Vows and pledges don't matter.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.740]   What you may have said solemnly in a church service, what's it matter?
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.340]   Happiness, I'm entitled to it.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.980]   My joy, I don't care how much other people suffer.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.060]   Perhaps my little children, doesn't matter.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.060]   It's what I want.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:46.100]   Honor, it's not considered.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.740]   That's what modern man is proclaiming in sin, you see.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.340]   He thinks he's praising himself, doing wonderfully for himself, making a great life for himself
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:32:01.340]   in this way, by trampling across the law and spitting upon the sanctities.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:13.140]   But he displays this tragic, this foul view of life and qualities and sanctities, the
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.980]   noblest things that belong to man.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:22.620]   This kind of man, man in sin, who thinks he's so marvelous and so able and so successful
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.380]   is without knowing it, insulting himself.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.820]   He's deceiving himself.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.780]   He's making a fool of himself.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.500]   Well let me say a word about that second principle.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:38.300]   How does man's folly and self-deceit manifest itself?
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.120]   Well in this way.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.580]   You notice the way it's put here.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:48.300]   As the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth riches and not
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:56.660]   by right shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:02.420]   What a terrible commentary on life, but how terribly true.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.260]   How does he thus show that he's a fool?
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.380]   Well in this way.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:18.900]   What he has done and what he's planned always disappoints him and invariably fails to give
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.580]   real satisfaction.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.340]   Like that young offspring that runs away from this partridge at the call of its lawful parent,
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:33.500]   so this man finds that all he thinks he's got for himself suddenly leaves him in the
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.980]   midst of his days.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.260]   I take that to mean what I'm saying.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.900]   That it never really gives satisfaction.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.620]   That when you think you've just arrived at that point when you're going to enjoy it all
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:56.060]   so marvelously, it somehow doesn't seem to turn out like that.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.820]   Oh I could illustrate this to you endlessly.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.500]   There are some men who've lived in this world to satisfy their own ambition, to get on in
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.780]   politics, or to get on in a profession or something like that.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:14.340]   They've been ambitious men and if only they've set their hearts upon it.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.580]   I've rarely known such a person rarely satisfied.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.180]   There's always a fly in the ointment.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.500]   Something always seems to go wrong.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.540]   They've broken the rules, they've sacrificed honor, they may have been dishonest, they
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.860]   may have lost their characters, they haven't been found out and they're very pleased about
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.860]   it.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.420]   But now as a result of all this they think they've got it.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.740]   But have they got it?
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.100]   Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.300]   There are rivals, there is jealousy and envy.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.140]   And some or another when you think you've got enough money to buy your pleasures, you
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.140]   can't buy it with money.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:59.980]   There are millionaires who are unhappy and very envious of certain poor Christians who've
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:05.340]   got peace and joy and love and happiness in their hearts and who can sleep at night without
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.340]   drugs.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.060]   No, no.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.060]   You see the trouble with men is that he doesn't know himself.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.540]   He doesn't know his own greatness.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.300]   Men cannot be satisfied with money.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.100]   Men can't be satisfied with things.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.260]   Men can't live by bread alone.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.940]   He can't live by bread and drink and money and wealth and position and the gratification
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.660]   of his passions and his lusts.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.420]   You know men simply cannot.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.500]   He gets tired of it.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:46.140]   And men who've lived a life of sin are like extinct volcanoes waiting for something further
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.580]   to stimulate them.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.300]   They've exhausted themselves.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.140]   They can't find satisfaction.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.620]   I'm giving you facts.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:01.100]   The most miserable people in the world at this moment are people who've lived for pleasure
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.900]   and have now become too old or too poor to have it in the way they wanted or can no longer
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.220]   react to its stimulus.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.100]   You see the pleasure goes in the midst of the days as it were.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:20.420]   Old Jeremiah has already put it very perfectly in the second chapter of this prophecy.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.820]   He says that all men who live without God and who live by their wits and their own cleverness
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:30.700]   and who think that they can plan perfect happiness for themselves, they dig out cisterns for
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:38.620]   themselves and when they need them most of all they find that they are but broken cisterns.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:46.580]   And they have to admit at last, "I've tried the broken cisterns, Lord, but ah, their waters
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.580]   fail."
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.380]   They always do.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.820]   But what a tragedy it is that men should thus deceive himself, that he should be such a
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.820]   fool.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.980]   "My dear friend, you are made on the image of God."
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:07.300]   And nothing less than God himself can finally satisfy.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.340]   Or to put it in the second form, I'll put it like this.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:22.580]   Such a man always finds himself at the end without anything at all.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:30.100]   He hadn't realized that face to face with certain inevitable eventualities, that all
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:36.780]   the things he'd lived for are of no value whatsoever.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:42.220]   Would your money help you when your heart is broken?
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:47.420]   Would the wealth of the universe compensate you for the death of a loved one?
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.460]   No, no.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:38:00.500]   Face to face with the biggest events in life, birth and death, marriage and all these things,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.460]   these things that men outside Christ live for, they're of no value.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:11.100]   And that's what this man discovers at the end.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:18.500]   When you find yourself old and your faculty is failing, or when even if you're young,
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:29.180]   you suddenly have some terrible illness, some acute infection or some growth, when you find
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:35.380]   yourself lying on your deathbed, what's the value of money?
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.380]   What's the value of pleasure?
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:43.900]   Do you think that on your deathbed you'll ask somebody to put on the dance band for
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.900]   you?
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.380]   It'll mock you.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.140]   It'll jeer at you.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.660]   It'll laugh in your face.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.780]   Take all the things the world lives for.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.340]   It's gossip, it's scandal, it's sex mania.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.860]   Will you want all that on your deathbed, you think?
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.100]   No, no.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.020]   Like this ill-gotten wealth, it leaves you and vanishes just when you need it most of
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:14.420]   all, and at the end you find you've got nothing.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.940]   Isn't that the folly and the tragedy of men?
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.700]   Isn't it some awful deceit that leads to that?
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.260]   You see, that's why he emphasizes this, that's why that man in the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.820]   talks about the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.820]   Think of a man who's lived seventy years in this world, ignoring God altogether and all
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:40.860]   the sanctities, living by his wits according to the mind of the world, and living for these
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.620]   things that are supposed to be so marvelous.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:49.380]   Perhaps he's had great notoriety in the press, and the world says, "A great man," and there
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:59.900]   he is at the end with all the things for which he has lived, absolutely useless.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.060]   As that man puts it in that 49th Psalm, which I read to you at the beginning, he can't take
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.060]   them with him.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.780]   He can't take his money, his great estates, his great name.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.820]   They don't count in the next world.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.500]   What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.980]   It's no use at the bar of judgment saying, "Look at my bank balance.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.220]   How marvelously I did while I was there.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   Look at the happiness.
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.220]   Look at the thrill.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.620]   What a wonderful figure I cut in society."
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:30.820]   The categories are not recognized in the spiritual realm.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:38.740]   They are refuse, they are dumb, they are worthless and useless.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.500]   The man finds himself, you see, at the end with nothing.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.740]   Yes, or to put it positively, as I close.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:55.180]   But this clever man who thought that he had so cleverly and in such a subtle manner, by
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:01.840]   breaking the laws and the rules, this clever man who thought he'd made such perfect provision
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:12.020]   for himself, what he really finds at the end is that he's made no provision whatsoever
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.140]   for himself.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.580]   He's naked.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:27.140]   Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.020]   At the end you're as stripped as you were at the beginning.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:37.620]   All you've amassed is taken off you, and your naked soul goes back to stand before
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:42.740]   its maker.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:47.900]   The poor man finds that he's made no provision at all.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:57.500]   They shall leave him in the midst of his days, and at his end he shall be a fool.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.780]   The man who was so wise, so far-sighted, so long-seeing, so worldly-wise, looking after
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:10.780]   himself always, what he's neglected above everything else is himself, his soul.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:18.220]   He's made no provision for it whatsoever.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.140]   He's no provision for eternity.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:26.180]   He's no provision for answering God's law and God's absolute demands.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:33.740]   He's no provision for clothing himself in the presence of that holy God.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:43.140]   Beseetfulness, unutterable folly.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.020]   What can be done with such a man?
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:54.300]   My dear friend, the thing that makes this gospel so marvelous and so wonderful, and
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:01.740]   that should move us all to the depths of our being, is this, that though we have all, like
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:10.140]   Saul the king of Israel of old, played the fool, and in our folly have pitted our little
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:15.860]   selves against God, and have defied him, and have broken his laws, and have asserted our
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:24.660]   ideas against him, though we've done all that and deserve nothing but to reap the consequences
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:29.820]   of our own folly to all eternity.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:38.260]   God in his infinite love and kindness and compassion is prepared to forgive us if we
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:46.500]   but acknowledge and confess our folly and our utter deceitfulness.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:53.220]   If we see it, and if we go to him and confess it, which is repentance, if we see that our
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:44:01.900]   attitude towards God has been wrong over and above our actions, and if we go and cast ourselves
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:09.740]   unreservedly upon his love and mercy and compassion, do you know what he'll tell you?
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:16.060]   He will tell you that before you ever did that, he had looked upon you.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.420]   He'd seen your arrogance, your pride, your folly.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.940]   But he had said, "This is due to sin, this is due to evil.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:28.700]   They're blind, they don't know."
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.900]   And he has contrived a way for delivering you.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:39.020]   God so loved the world, the world that has done the very things about which I've been
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.140]   speaking.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:49.980]   God so loved that world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.740]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.660]   Thank God, God is the lawgiver, you see.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.620]   He doesn't break his own laws, he can act above them.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.940]   We've broken his laws, and the law is what a man so effectually also reaps.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:09.380]   I've sinned, therefore I must die and be damned.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.340]   But God has found another way.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:18.860]   His Son has come and has borne my doom, my damnation, and has died for me.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:27.620]   So God gives me new life, pardons me, forgives me, reconciles me to himself, gives me this
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:36.340]   new principle, fills me with a new law, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:45.780]   and opens out to me a glorious harvest, a spiritual harvest of praise and of glory in
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.780]   eternity.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.980]   Very well, I end by putting it in this form.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.100]   You can't improve upon the Apostle Paul, he always puts it perfectly and always has
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.340]   the last word.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.020]   He puts it like this.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:09.060]   "If any man," he says, "willeth to be wise in this world," and that's what we
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.420]   all want, isn't it?
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.820]   We all by nature, as I've said, want to be wise in this world.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.660]   We want to do the best for ourselves.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:25.820]   "If any man willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.820]   be made wise."
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.500]   What does he mean by that?
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.580]   Well, he means this.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.540]   He's been saying in that first epistle to the Corinthians, from which I've just quoted
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:39.420]   in the third chapter, he's already been saying in that epistle that the gospel of
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:45.260]   Jesus Christ, that God's way of salvation by sending his Son into the world and by putting
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:50.460]   our sins on him and punishing them in him that he may forgive us, that that to the Greeks
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.700]   is foolishness.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.020]   The Greeks said, "What unutterable folly!
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.320]   You can't have two natures in one person.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.260]   You can't put the sins of another man on another and punish him.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.260]   It's unjust.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.580]   That's folly," says the Greek.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.060]   The cross of Christ and its preaching to the Greek was utter foolishness, unutterable folly.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.460]   Men who believe it, they said, are fools.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:22.460]   Very well, says Paul, if you really want to be wise in this world, become a fool.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:29.660]   Become as a little child, humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and say, "I
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.660]   don't know.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.380]   I see that I've been a fool.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.680]   I've trusted to a mind that isn't big enough.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.020]   The minds of the greatest philosophers were not enough, so how could mine be?
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.020]   I see my folly.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.380]   I don't care what men may say.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:44.380]   They may say I've gone soft, that I've become a lunatic, that I've become as a child.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.540]   I am a child.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:52.340]   I don't know, and I go to God empty-handed, and as a little child I confess my folly,
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:58.260]   my deceitfulness, my sin, and I believe God's Word.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:03.620]   I don't understand it because it's so great, but I believe it when it tells me that Jesus
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:09.380]   Christ and Him crucified is the wisdom of God and the power of God.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.420]   I'll submit myself to it.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:15.540]   I'll receive it and accept it."
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.660]   That's the answer.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.340]   Are you alive to these things, my friend?
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:25.420]   Read again when you go home the 49th Psalm.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:29.980]   Realize that the man who trusts to himself is a fool, and he'll know it at the end.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:35.860]   Realize it now, and therefore repent and believe the gospel.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:44.900]   Become a fool in the eyes of the world, that you may be wise in the sight of God by accepting
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:49:03.700]   His wisdom, which is Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
