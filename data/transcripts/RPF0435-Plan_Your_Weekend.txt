[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   Hey, Radicals, welcome to the podcast.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.640]   Today I have a very short coaching message for you.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.000]   I'm going to take off my financial advisor hat for a moment, put on my life coach hat,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.480]   talk to you about the power of planning your free time.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.800]   It's been a busy week for me this week.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.560]   I've been working, working, working on a number of important projects, trying to make measurable
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.200]   progress toward some of the goals that I have.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.200]   This week's been busy.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.640]   I've been working a lot because looking forward to the birth of our new little baby boy here
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240]   in a couple of months.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.720]   The birth of a child is a very special time in my life, in your life.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.000]   It's extremely special in your relationship with your husband or wife.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.960]   It's a time to pull back, and I intend to do that, pull back a little bit when our little
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.080]   baby boy is born.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.240]   It's also potentially very disruptive.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.640]   When our daughter was born, for the first few months of her life, first week she was
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.640]   great.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.160]   For the first few months, she was extremely sick, basically would cry all day, every day,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.360]   and it was probably the most trying few months of my life that I've been through yet.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.000]   Being aware of that, I need to make sure that I've made progress now while our little baby
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.160]   boy is not crying.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.800]   He's inside his mommy's tummy.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.440]   He's not crying.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.080]   He's maybe sucking his thumb and he's turning cartwheels.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.160]   He's not turning cartwheels at this point.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.360]   He's gotten big enough where he doesn't turn easy cartwheels, but he's not crying.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.800]   This is the point in time at which I need to be making hay to mix my metaphors.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.440]   It's been a busy week, and for you, I bet it's been a busy week as well.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.560]   You're a hardworking person.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.360]   You're a motivated, goal-oriented individual.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.160]   You've been working.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.080]   The question is here as I sit here on Friday afternoon transitioning to planning the weekend,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.480]   do I spend as much time carefully planning my weekend as I do planning my work week?
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:20.200]   I have to confess that I'm as guilty as you are of placing more focus on my work week
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.600]   than on my weekend.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:34.320]   I've changed this, and I've learned to intentionally plan my free time.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.440]   My wife and my children and my friends and my family and all of the people with whom
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.520]   I'm interacting are the reason why we spend so much time working so hard.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.320]   It's easy to forget that.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:59.280]   After all, work is measurable, but shouldn't your days off also be measurable?
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.440]   Why would you spend more time planning your work week in order to be effective and not
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.760]   spend any time planning your days off?
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.080]   So as I sit here, I've made great progress in planning my days off.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.560]   As I sit here working on my plans for tomorrow, Saturday, which is a combination of work day
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.160]   and family day and Sunday, which I don't work on Sundays, when I start planning these
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.760]   things I've found that I get a lot more juice from them, a lot more joy.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.280]   Here's what I challenge you to do.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.720]   Stop what you're doing.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.320]   Pull over to the side of the road for a few minutes if you're driving or if you're listening
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   to me.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   Just stop what you're doing and pull out a pen and a piece of paper or the digital equivalent
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.840]   of that and start thinking through your weekend days.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.400]   Plan out your weekend days with as much focus as you do your work week days.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.040]   I was on a coaching call with one of my coaching clients earlier this afternoon and we were
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   talking about this and the recommendations that I gave to my client were to take out
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.400]   a piece of paper, start the day at the same normal time that you do.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   I don't know about you.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.240]   I think I prefer to wake up at the same time on the weekends as I do on the weekdays.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.120]   It's just more important and valuable for me to have my early morning time.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.880]   But if you start the day at 6 a.m., start the day at 6 a.m. and sketch out each hour
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.440]   of the day and plan first your activities.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.760]   So what activities are you going to do that are going to rejuvenate you and refresh you
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.640]   and strengthen you and revitalize you?
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.540]   What activities are going to make you really feel the zest of living?
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.800]   What activities are available to you that you often go past?
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.520]   What's the museum right around the corner?
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.840]   Don't just sit at home and start flipping through channels.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.000]   Go out and live, whatever that means to you.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.240]   That means working in your garden.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   Plan it out.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   What are you going to do in your garden tomorrow?
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.680]   What are you going to plant?
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.480]   What are you going to take out?
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.920]   If you're going to work on projects in the house, line them up.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920]   What are you going to do?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.520]   What do you need to get done?
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.320]   If you're going to go and go out on the paddle boards or take the canoes out on the lake,
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.240]   plan it out and plan that day.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   Plan each and every hour of the day.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.520]   Plan times with the special people.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.160]   Maybe you're going to plan to get up in the morning, have breakfast together with your
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.560]   family, you're going to load up your bags and load up some water bottles and take your
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560]   family out for a hike.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.400]   You're going to hike out to the lake and have a picnic at the lake.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   Plan it.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.920]   Maybe the afternoon you can take your daughter on a daddy-daughter date or you can take your
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.680]   son to something special and go and buy your son something special that he's been wanting
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.280]   to have.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.880]   Maybe in the evening you can plan a special family adventure.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.280]   Just plan a special date with your husband or wife and make it really special and thoughtful.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:15.920]   Dress up, buy flowers, make it an event, especially when it comes to our family relationships.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.760]   I'm not preaching at you about romance, but it's so easy.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.840]   I guess I am.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.000]   I am preaching at you about romance.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.840]   The point of this is to plan your free time, but romance is an important part of that.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.400]   It's so easy to take the people we care the most about for granted.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:40.520]   It's so easy to slip out of the care that we once showed for them and to slip into the
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.200]   comfort of an old slipper.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Take them for granted.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:50.240]   Tell you what, you take your husband or your wife for granted, first year you'll just have
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.960]   a little bit of a dullness in the relationship.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.460]   Second year, you'll just have a little bit of dullness in the relationship, but you do
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.220]   it too much longer and pretty quickly you'll be signing divorce papers.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.100]   So don't take your husband or wife for granted.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:15.780]   Plan your time with them as vigorously as you plan your work week.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.400]   We all say that these things are important to us.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.640]   We all say that it's important to spend focused time with the people we care about.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:35.600]   Isn't it time we follow through and put our planning skills, our calendaring skills, our
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.440]   productivity skills, and our money where our mouth is?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   Get to it.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:56.880]   My child arrived just the other day.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:04.240]   He came to the world in the usual way, but there were planes to catch and bills to pay.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.800]   He learned to walk while I was away, and he was talking for I knew it, and as he grew
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.520]   he'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   You know I'm gonna be like you."
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.520]   And the cats in the cradle and the sills roll, little boy blue and the man in the fold.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   When you're coming home, Daddy, don't know when, but we'll get together then.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   You know we'll have a good time then.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:45.200]   My son turned ten just the other day.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.280]   He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   Come on, let's play.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   Can you teach me to throw?"
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   I said, "Not today.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   I got a lot to do."
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   He said, "That's okay."
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   And he walked away, but he smiled, never did, and said, "I'm gonna be like him.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   Yeah, you know I'm gonna be like him."
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   And the cats in the cradle and the sills roll, little boy blue and the man in the fold.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   When you're coming home, Daddy, don't know when, but we'll get together then.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   You know we'll have a good time then.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.280]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:30.920]   And the cats in the cradle and the sills roll, little boy blue and the man in the fold.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:59.440]   When you're coming home, Daddy, don't know when, but we'll get together then.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:28.960]   You know we'll have a good time then.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.

[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   You know I'm gonna be like him.
