[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Today on the show, we tackle this question, how can dual income, high earning couples
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.840]   lower their income taxes?
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.960]   I'm going to give you a litany of ideas.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.440]   I'm going to give you an overall framework for how to think about this problem.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.400]   Then I'm going to systematically go through a bunch of credits, deductions, itemized options
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:45.040]   for you that you might be able to use to lower your income taxes if this describes you.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.840]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.740]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.680]   Thank you so much for being with me today.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.980]   Thrilled to bring you this question and today's show is a special Q&A show.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.720]   Comes just going to handle this one question, but this question comes from a patron of the
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   show.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.180]   One of the benefits of patronage at the $200 a month level is that you get to pick the
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:17.040]   topic of the show and today this is a special request Q&A from Joshua.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.880]   If you haven't been over to the Patreon page recently, then feel free to go over there.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.440]   But you'll see as you march up, you can support the show at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.080]   and there on that page I've got a bunch of bribes for you.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.920]   So you can contribute as little as a buck a month or even up as high as a couple hundred
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   dollars a month.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.400]   There are a number of supporters of the show who send me a couple hundred dollars a month.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.780]   In exchange for that, there are a number of different benefits.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.520]   That program by the way is sold out right now, although you can still send me money
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.800]   and I would greatly appreciate it, but the benefits are sold out.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.120]   But there are a number of benefits that that level of support gets.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.420]   One of them is a monthly mastermind.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.240]   Another one of those benefits however is that you get to pick the show topic and so this
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.440]   question comes in from a listener.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.240]   This listener, here's the question that he emailed me.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.640]   "Joshua, double income medium to high earning couples frequently ask me how to lower their
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   taxes.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.440]   My median income is at a higher rate of over 28% plus a state tax of 3.75% and social security
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.880]   of 7.65% or a total of 40% all in and I really don't have a lot to tell them.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.040]   I suggest to them that they calculate whether it's worth it for the second spouse to work.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.800]   For example, you can do your money or your lifestyle after tax, after child care, after
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.480]   gas expenses, income per hour of total time spent at the job, commuting and working.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.200]   I tell them the way, the qualitative factors, I tell them to max their 401k and to invest
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   in real estate.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.000]   But I'm assuming I'm missing things.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.520]   So even if you're not able to do a complete podcast on the subject, maybe you could have
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   some ideas.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   Thanks."
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.480]   And he goes on to say, "One reason my wife doesn't work is it's simply not worth it for
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.760]   her to work."
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.920]   So we're going to tackle this question and I'm going to give you the framework for it
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.840]   and I'm going to try to give a number of specific suggestions that will at least inspire some
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.280]   creativity.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   That's my hope.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.760]   Before we do that, I got a couple of quick announcements and I'm going to go ahead and
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.920]   talk about sponsors at the beginning of today's show.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.760]   Announcement number one first for patrons.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.360]   If you are a patron, you should have gotten an email from me in the last couple of days
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.720]   and that email is important because in it I announced a Q&A conference call with me
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.080]   and that conference call will be on Thursday, October 15th at 1 o'clock PM Eastern Standard
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   Time.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.900]   If you did not get that notification, check your email for the call-in number.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.440]   But that is for anybody who is a patron of the show.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   I've been slow the last two months due to all the changes in my personal life.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.320]   I haven't been able to get the last two months of Q&A calls, the monthly Q&A calls done.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.560]   And so as a thank you for sticking with me, even though I didn't deliver those, I'm doing
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.040]   a long conference call and I intend to answer as many questions as possible.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.400]   So if you want to get a live answer to your question on that conference call, check the
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   patron page.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.300]   If you're not a patron, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and you'll find all the details there.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.620]   And if you do that before Thursday at 1 o'clock PM, you'll be able to participate in that
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.980]   call at any level of patronage.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.860]   Number two benefit for patrons is because I've missed those last couple of months of
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.460]   Q&A calls, I've decided for the next eight weeks to do a weekly Q&A call with patrons
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.480]   who are at $10 and up rather than a monthly Q&A call.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.300]   So for the next eight weeks, each week I'm doing a Q&A call at a certain day and a certain
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.300]   time.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.400]   Those details are also on the patron page.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.940]   If you would like to get access to those Q&A calls, just go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron,
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.360]   sign up for supporting the show at $10 a month and greater, and you will quickly be able
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   to have access.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.980]   You'll immediately be able to have access to that and you can have access to those Q&A
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.900]   calls each week going forward for the next eight weeks.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.980]   Sponsors of the day, number one is Paladin Registry.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.660]   Paladin, if you haven't listened to it, go to listen to episode 248 where we launched
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.660]   Paladin Registry.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.620]   But in essence, if you are looking for a financial advisor, I would recommend that you start
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.780]   by going to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.020]   Listen to episode 248 of the show for a one-hour discussion with the founder of that website,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.860]   but it's a financial advisor referral service and I'd like you to check it out and start
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.740]   your search there as you search for a good financial advisor.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.460]   I'm starting to receive, I received one email from a listener who has gone ahead and started
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.940]   that, started interviewing financial advisors through that system.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.300]   If you have done that or if you are doing it, I would love to collect your feedback
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.620]   on their service.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.500]   Remember the sponsors are here to serve you.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.700]   But if you're looking for a good financial advisor, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin,
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.380]   put in your information and start interviewing the advisors that the system is there.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.660]   They're carefully curated and vetted and hopefully that will help you to get a good
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.660]   one.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.100]   My plan number two is you need a budget, budgeting software.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.420]   This is the budgeting software that I now use to run my family's budgeting and it is
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.060]   fantastic.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.380]   For details on that, listen to episode 246 for an extensive review of the software and
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.680]   an interview with the founder of the show.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:20.420]   You can download a free 30-day free trial at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB, Y-N-A-B,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.540]   stands for you need a budget.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.220]   So go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB, download the free software.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.780]   It's a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.780]   Put in some information.
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.100]   I recommend you just keep it very simple.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.220]   Do one bank account, do your personal checking account and just work with it for 30 days.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.740]   Take the free classes that they offer and see if you like it.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.020]   I personally love it and I think everybody should be budgeting with this software as
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.020]   a starting place.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.140]   It's fantastic.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.100]   So announcements and sponsors done.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.180]   Let's go on to the major point.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.820]   So let's talk about tax planning.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.020]   This question of how can – specifically how it's stated, how can a dual income high-earning
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:03.660]   household lower their taxes, this is a thorny one because from the perspective of taxes,
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.060]   this is the absolute worst place to be.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.080]   Households that are made up of two employees, both working outside the house, both earning
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.140]   high incomes are screwed by the US tax code.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.220]   Now the level of your screwedness depends on where you live, how much you earn, what
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.760]   you do, all of – what kind of company you work for, those kinds of things.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.580]   But this is absolutely the worst place to be and this is why the political gamesters
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.620]   get away with talking about how the rich aren't taxed enough.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.500]   Most famously when Warren Buffett a couple of years ago made all the news and was trotting
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.100]   around talking about how my secretary pays more in taxes, which is a lie.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.540]   It's stupid because the secretary doesn't pay more in taxes.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.940]   But as expressed at a ratio of income, it's absolutely true because the secretary is earning
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.300]   income and is paying taxes on her earned income.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:05.700]   So she's going to be taxed on earned income, wages and salaries at a higher rate than Buffett's
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.660]   income which is all structured in the form of dividend payments.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.740]   Now this is an intentional plan behind the tax code but what it just illustrates in stark
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.120]   contrast is how employees are screwed basically.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:28.460]   Now in order to reduce your income tax, you must reduce your income and it's absolutely
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.700]   as simple as that.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:36.620]   The higher the income that you earn, number one, the higher the total tax amount that
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:43.200]   you will pay and number two, the higher the total rate that you pay.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.780]   So the only way to reduce your income tax is to reduce your income.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.020]   This is why the system that we have of progressive taxation is so stupid.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.500]   You're always disincentivized from making more money unless you have a really compelling
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.740]   reason to do it because the more money you make, the more total tax you're going to pay
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.560]   and the higher rate of tax you're going to pay.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.600]   So the simple answer to the question of how do I reduce my income tax is simply, "Well,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.380]   how can I reduce my income?"
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.800]   Now many of you are sitting there shaking your head saying, "Well, how could Joshua
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   say I can reduce my income?
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.600]   I thought he was going to give me something intelligent."
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.320]   Well, that's where we get into the major question that you're asking which is, "Is there a way
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.900]   that I can reduce my income on paper without actually reducing my income in reality?"
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.000]   Or "Is there a way that I can play some kind of trick to reduce my income without actually
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.840]   reducing my lifestyle?
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.000]   Is there some fancy trick, some fancy deduction, some fancy credit, some little thing that
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.420]   I can use to allow me to spend the same amount of money but pay less in taxes?"
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.560]   The answer to that question is maybe.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.320]   You might be able to play some tricks on paper with your income and with your deductions
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.520]   and with everything like that if you're willing to jump through hoops and if you're not consuming
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.340]   all of your income.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:11.440]   If you have a high income and you consume all or most of that income, then there's not
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.200]   going to be anything that you can do to affect your taxation.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.120]   Every single tax planning strategy that I know of is going to involve some level of
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.680]   change in your level of consumption.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.200]   The best example I could use of this would be making a 401(k) contribution.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.160]   This would be the first place that any employee would start, make a 401(k) contribution.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.160]   Well as I'll go over in a moment, this is an income timing strategy and basically what
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.240]   you're doing is saying, "Well, I don't need to consume this income now.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.240]   So I'm going to put it into a 401(k) account and then later I'll consume it at a lower
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   tax rate."
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.240]   That's the whole gist of the strategy.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.300]   It's an income timing strategy.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.660]   But that assumes that you're not going to spend the money.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.600]   You might think I'm belaboring a point.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.200]   I am.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.360]   Most of you listening aren't living up to your income but many couples are.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:08.320]   The simple reality is that the high earning couple that's also the high consumption couple
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.680]   is the ideal – this is the ideal household from the perspective of US tax policy because
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.960]   you are absolutely going to pay the highest amount of taxes.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.520]   You must be able to be somewhat flexible with your consumption patterns if you're going
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.080]   to implement any strategies around taxes.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.120]   Now, it's up to you to try to figure out the reason why this is the case.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.440]   I have my own opinions on it.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440]   Are they right?
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   Are they wrong?
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   I don't know.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.840]   Personally, I think the system that results in this being the fact that high income earning
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.880]   households from wages and salaries, high consumption households are the most heavily taxed, personally
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   I think it's stupid.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.440]   It's a stupid lifestyle for most people and there are much smarter, more intelligent lifestyles,
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.160]   the ways that you can achieve better results without paying and living in this high tax
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.320]   lifestyle.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.280]   But everything is oriented around this type of lifestyle in our modern American society.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   We're trained from the beginning to be consumers.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.840]   We're taught to be a homogenous society so that we're easily marketed to.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.360]   Your class is going to determine for most people your level of consumption.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.120]   The neighborhood that you live in will be determined by the type of job that you have.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.480]   The type of job that you have will determine what type of car you should wear, what type
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.880]   of clothes you should wear.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.280]   So we've become a very homogenous system and this leads to a need for high levels of income
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.960]   and high levels of consumption.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.120]   You've got to be a little bit countercultural in order to go against that and save money
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.440]   on your taxes.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.320]   So it's up to you to figure out why.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:45.880]   I'd say just simply look at your lifestyle straight ahead and then think about it intentionally.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.120]   Create your life and your lifestyle intentionally.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.160]   If you're willing to think about your lifestyle and create it intentionally, figure out what's
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.920]   really important to you and if you're willing to adjust your consumption patterns so that
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.720]   there's some flexibility in your budget, then you can design a much more efficient
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   lifestyle for yourself.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.560]   Now let me give you the framework for tax planning and this is very important that you
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   understand.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.740]   There are only three major tax planning strategies that I'm aware of and all of the little tips
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.640]   and tricks fit into these strategies.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:25.720]   These include number one, income timing strategies or let's just call them timing strategies
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.760]   which a timing strategy is when do we recognize the income?
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.480]   Do we bring it forward or do we defer it out?
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.920]   Do we push it to the future or bring it forward to today?
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.720]   Any type of timing strategy will involve when do we actually recognize the income or it'll
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.840]   involve when do we recognize the expense or the deduction.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.700]   Do we push the deduction forward or do we bring it forward to today?
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.400]   If this is your first time understanding or hearing about the concept of timing strategies,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   don't worry.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.560]   I'll explain it more in a moment when we go through some specific ideas that could
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:03.320]   be applied to a dual income household or go back and listen to episode 36 of Radical Personal
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.880]   Finance wherein I talk in detail about this as a framework.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.000]   The second of the three strategies would involve income shifting.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.040]   This is where we are shifting the income that we have from a high rate taxpayer to a low
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:24.160]   rate taxpayer or from moving an expense from a pre-tax expense to – or from post-tax
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.180]   expense to a pre-tax expense by shifting it among an entity.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.480]   The third strategy would be a conversion strategy where we're converting income from a high
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.840]   tax rate activity to a low tax rate activity.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.680]   This is the framework that you need to apply.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:45.240]   So if you understand the framework, then you can look at your own situation and understand
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.200]   what is the best way for me to apply it.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.220]   Again, go listen to episode 36 and episode 41 of Radical Personal Finance for an in-depth
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.820]   discussion on it.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:00.560]   By starting with goals, you'll be able to figure out how can I achieve my actual goals
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.460]   and apply the appropriate strategy to lower my taxation.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.860]   So begin with what is my ideal life?
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.400]   What is my ideal lifestyle?
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.760]   What is my ideal day?
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.080]   What do I want the meaning of my life to be?
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.000]   At my funeral, what do I want the meaning of my life to be?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.280]   Good journaling exercise for you if you've never done it.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.560]   Sit down and write your eulogy.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.840]   Find yourself a quiet place, get a cup of coffee, sit down with a journal and a pen
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.600]   that you like writing with or whatever your preferred way of writing is, maybe your computer,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.000]   and write your eulogy as you would like your best friend to deliver it for you at your
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.160]   funeral.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.440]   And then look at that eulogy and figure out, "Well, what do I need to do to make this
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.020]   eulogy true so my friends don't have to lie about me at my funeral?"
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.560]   If you start there, what you'll start to get closer to is what is the overall impact
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.120]   and meaning of your life?
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.360]   And that might include what you're doing at your job or it might include something
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.620]   different.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:04.180]   By starting with that as a perspective, then you can efficiently design the financial plan,
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.860]   the tax plan to help you to accomplish that.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.120]   Here would be a simple example.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.740]   Let's say that you are a dual income household like so many people are.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.720]   That means that when we put the aggregate of your taxes together and we'll talk about
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.600]   the different types of taxes you're paying in a moment.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   When you put the aggregate of your taxes together, then the second income is being taxed at an
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.380]   aggregate rate of about 40-ish percent.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.760]   Now assume that you're in a situation like so many families are where you have children
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.320]   at home and you have also aging parents and perhaps you have an aging parent who needs
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.760]   care of some kind.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.920]   Well, there are a couple of ways that you can do this.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:45.920]   Number one, you can keep on working at your job and you can continue to earn money.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.560]   You can use that money to pay with – number one, you got to pay 40% on every dollar.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.960]   You can turn around and use that money.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.520]   You can use it to hire a caregiver for your parents.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.200]   You can use it to hire caregivers for your kids, all of which are extremely expensive
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   activities.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.000]   So you're going to earn a dollar, pay 40 cents in tax to the government and then use
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.520]   some of the 60 cents that's left over to pay for the caregiver and pay for your kids
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.880]   which is all non-deductible activities.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:20.560]   Well, if your goal of your eulogy is to be a corporate titan and you are proud that your
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.040]   best friend talks about your business acumen and how high you rose in the ranks of the
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   corporate life, that would be an appropriate strategy.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.680]   But perhaps your eulogy involves something like Joshua was the most loving person I know.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.240]   He always had time for the people that were close to him.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.420]   He built strong family relationships.
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.880]   His family always knew that no matter what, he loved and cared about them.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.740]   I'm not saying that you can't maintain that as an accurate reality through hiring
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.180]   caregivers for your children, for your parents.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.080]   But if you were facing a situation like that, it might be much more efficient for you to
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:02.540]   simply say, "Why don't we stop paying this 40% marginal tax rates, drop back, cut
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:08.120]   our income, cut our taxes and I'll go ahead and be the caregiver for parents and kids."
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.960]   It's up to you what you do.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.440]   I'm not telling you how to live your life.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.320]   But that would explain an example of how your long-term values would impact what you actually
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.520]   did in the type of strategy that you chose to pursue.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.880]   It's up to you to figure out how to actually implement it.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.640]   So begin with what are your actual goals for your life and your lifestyle and then design
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.720]   around those goals an intentional plan.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.920]   A good way to think about this is pretend that you're hired as a consultant to a
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.600]   business, the business of U, Inc., so Joshua Sheets, Inc.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.080]   And if I were hired as a consultant to Joshua Sheets, Inc. and I were hired to run Joshua
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.640]   Sheets' life, what would I do?
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.520]   Well, I would start with saying, "What is the mission and purpose of this company?
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.320]   Why does this company exist?"
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.200]   Get very clear on that.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.760]   Bring that back to your life.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.480]   Why do you exist?
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.640]   Get very clear on that.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.160]   That's number one.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.080]   Number two, I would do an audit to find out where are we with regard to fulfilling our
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.200]   mission.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.360]   What's the current status?
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.800]   Is Joshua Sheets on track to fulfill the mission for why he exists?
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   Is he ahead of the game?
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.240]   Is he behind the game?
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.320]   Where are we with regard to that mission?
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.440]   That's number three if I were coaching Joshua Sheets, Inc.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.960]   I would say, "All right.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.440]   We've got a clear mission and purpose.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.000]   What tools and equipment and personnel are going to be required for us to achieve our
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.280]   mission?
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   Is this mission the type of thing that will be achieved with a small number of employees
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.560]   or a large number of employees?
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.600]   Minimal equipment, lots of work.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   Maximum equipment, minimal work."
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.000]   All goes back to the mission and purpose.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.840]   Then I would go to the financials and I would say, "Where are we with regard to our financials?
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.880]   What income do we have?
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   What assets do we have?"
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.840]   We'd take a look at a balance sheet and we'd create a balance sheet.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.760]   Then I would say, "Where are we with regard to our cash flow, our income and our outgo?"
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.720]   That's where our cash flow statement works in.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.480]   Search the archives for balance sheet and cash flow statement and you'll see how those
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.080]   things drive everything in the financial plan.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:16.280]   So you start with the big picture and then you go to the line by line item analysis.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.600]   You've got to have both the big picture and the line by line item analysis in order to
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:26.160]   do effective tax planning because tax planning is not one big thing.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.020]   It's many, many little things applied in a specific local situation.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.920]   If you're a corporate executive living in New York City paying in excess of 50% taxes
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.680]   and you find out that your mission statement, your purpose statement actually involves you
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:47.420]   rescuing Mustang ponies in Wyoming, you'd be a fool to continue paying 50% of your income
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:53.000]   in taxes when you can go and take $100,000 and buy yourself a ranch and start rescuing
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.440]   Mustang ponies in Wyoming in a state that has no income tax, no state income tax.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.560]   You drop your total tax burden to under 10%.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.040]   That would be the big win.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.280]   But if on the other hand your mission is to transform New York City and bring it into
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.680]   a global leader as a city, well, sitting on your horse ranch in Wyoming isn't a very
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.740]   good way to do that.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.720]   So first you make sure the big things are there by talking about mission, purpose, strategy.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   Then you go to the line by line item and whether you're running a horse ranch in Wyoming or
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.760]   whether you're running the city government in New York City, you go line by line through
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.080]   the budget, through the balance sheet and you make sure that you're approaching things
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.480]   efficiently.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.040]   What happens though is people get these things wrong.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.440]   I'm laboring on this point.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.920]   Hopefully I'm not belaboring it, but I'm laboring on this point because this is what I see throughout
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.160]   the world that people get wrong.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.480]   The basics of tax advice is start a 401(k).
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.400]   Well, a 401(k) might be a useful tool for you or it might not.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.880]   I regret some of my 401(k) contributions at this point in my financial life because I
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.640]   wasn't clear enough on my mission and purpose and what I wanted my life to look like when
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.600]   I was making those contributions.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.120]   And how many times have you seen this happen where somebody diligently labors to put money
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.480]   in their 401(k), then they decide they want to pursue another course of action and now
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.640]   they have no access to the money that's in their 401(k) because they took that deal of
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.080]   giving up access to it thinking that that was what they needed to do to reduce their
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.440]   taxes.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.280]   In some circumstances it might have been much better for them just to put the money in a
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.520]   bank account, pay the tax now so that they could fulfill their larger purpose and their
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.360]   larger mission.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.480]   We get these things wrong, we get them backwards by focusing first on the strategy and on the
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.880]   tactic instead of focusing first on the mission and on the purpose.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.560]   The strategy and the tactic is important, but it must be subjugated to its proper place
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.920]   in our planning approach.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:53.560]   If you're not clear on the mission, purpose, and vision for what you're trying to accomplish,
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:02.800]   you don't know whether you should build warships, airplanes, or intercontinental ballistic missiles
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.080]   or order a bunch of rifles for your soldiers.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.640]   If you're fighting a global superpower and you want to have a way to destroy their major
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.160]   air base facilities, an intercontinental ballistic missile is a useful tool.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.320]   If you're fighting a guerrilla warfare in the streets of a far-flung city, you need
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.760]   rifles and well-trained people, not intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.560]   I'm mixing about a dozen metaphors in this show and I'm going to move on, but don't
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.400]   miss the point.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.920]   Get clear on the big picture and then craft the plan to that.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.960]   Don't start with this prescribed predetermined lifestyle that is marketed from the pages
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.680]   of every financial magazine, from the advertisement on every page of every media communication
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.480]   that you get.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.760]   Create your own lifestyle.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:58.000]   Choose it yourself based upon your personal mission, your personal values.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.800]   Design it intentionally.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:06.720]   That's the most efficient process for you to build a good tax plan.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.280]   If you've got that message loud and clear, now let's dig into the specifics.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.920]   So back to the analysis.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:18.120]   We need to begin with some basic financial statements, balance sheet, cash flow statement,
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.640]   and then we need to do an analysis of where we are with regard to the total taxes paid
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.160]   over the previous – let's go with year, whatever the accounting period is that you're
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   going to look at, but let's go with year.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.080]   This will be where most couples – if you're helping somebody with tax planning or if you're
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.000]   doing it yourself, this will be where most people will absolutely fail because most people
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.440]   do not have any kind of financial records.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.760]   They don't have any kind of transaction record.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:48.360]   They don't have any ability or knowledge of what they're actually paying in taxes.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.040]   You can get some of this info directly from the tax return.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.920]   So a good place to start if you're doing this for yourself is learn how to read your tax
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   return.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   Take a look through.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.280]   They're not that complicated, especially for employees.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.800]   Just go through and read it.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.760]   What you want to do is you want to figure out how much total tax did I pay.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.960]   Here you'll see the first reason why you need a complete cash flow statement.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:16.220]   There are many kinds of taxes and federal income tax is only one type of tax.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.960]   As my listener who asked the question astutely stated, there are other types of taxes including
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:26.120]   state income taxes, also including employment taxes.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.720]   As an employee, employment taxes will be a major factor in your planning.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   Remember that the employment taxes that you pay as a W-2 employee, salaried employee,
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:44.920]   are going to be always 7.65% of the first $118,500 that you earn.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:56.480]   So for the first $118,500 that you earn, you're going to pay $9,065 of employment taxes.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.120]   That's what $118,500 is, the 2015 Social Security wage base.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.880]   Then you're going to pay an additional 1.45% Medicare taxes on every dollar in excess of
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.920]   that and then you need to look to see if you're going to pay the additional Medicare, Obamacare
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.560]   taxes on investment earnings and it gets a little more – I'm sorry, more complicated
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.560]   but it's less apt.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.640]   You do need to look through that.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.880]   That may or may not be a big number for you.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.660]   But for every again 120 grand, you're going to pay 9,000 bucks of employment taxes.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.440]   You need to be aware of that and you need to factor that in.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.040]   Here's where scale of income becomes a big deal.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.600]   You've got to look and understand what is the scale of your income.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.640]   What does high income actually mean?
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.360]   If you have $100,000 income, you can do a lot to save taxes with simple retirement accounts
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.960]   and deferral of income.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.800]   If you have a million-dollar income, a 401(k) deferral is practically useless to you.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:01.000]   Just consider that if you make a maximum 401(k) deferral amount in 2015 of $18,000, if you're
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.240]   earning $100,000 a year, that will allow you to save 18% of your income.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.120]   That will be useful for you.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.840]   If you're making a million dollars a year, then the 401(k) account will allow you to
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.360]   save 1.8% of your income.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.800]   Not that big of a deal.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:23.120]   So you've got to look to figure out what are my big taxes that I'm facing and what are
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.520]   going to be the strategies that are going to get me there, back to that $100,000 and
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.960]   million-dollar number.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:34.560]   If you're making $100,000 a year, your federal income taxes are not going to be very, very
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.940]   substantial, especially as compared to things like your employment taxes.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:47.240]   Your employment taxes are going to be a big, big number for you, 9,000 bucks-ish on $120,000.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.280]   So that's going to be a big number, and it's going to be comparable in many ways to your
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.920]   federal income taxes that you're paying.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.640]   If you're making a million bucks, then the employment taxes are going to be relatively
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.280]   insignificant.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.080]   But the federal income taxes are going to be extremely significant.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   So you've got to always keep in mind that your scale here is a big deal.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.200]   So that's why you look at your actual cash flow statement, and on that cash flow statement,
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   you start with gross income, your total income prior to any taxation, and then you have a
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:29.320]   line item for every single category of expense and every single category of income.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.480]   So you know where is your income coming from and what is every expense, including all of
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:40.800]   the different types of taxes that you're paying.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.680]   Based upon which of those tax line items is the largest, and we'll keep it simple, employment
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:52.600]   taxes, federal income taxes, and state income taxes, that's going to adjust your strategy.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:59.640]   But you also want to look at your other taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, miscellaneous
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.280]   consumption taxes, use taxes, et cetera, and figure out which of those is going to be the
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.120]   biggest deal to you.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:13.280]   Most people simply will not either have the capacity or make the time to create good data,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.160]   to create for themselves good statements.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.600]   But if you have it, it should show you the big wins.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   Example, you're a dual-income, high-income earning household.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.640]   This goes back to my listener's point about calculate the actual costs of working.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.840]   Let's say that you're a dual-income, high-income earning household.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:37.200]   One of you has a corporate job where you work in one office location.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.920]   The other of you has a corporate job where you're on the road a lot, sales.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.360]   I just was up in Asheville, North Carolina.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.040]   I spoke with a bunch of sales people.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.520]   That's a big financial hub – excuse me, not Asheville, Charlotte, North Carolina,
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.740]   big financial hub for sales guys.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.360]   They spend most of their week on an airplane.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.680]   It doesn't really matter where they live.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.080]   They pick Charlotte because it's good cost of living and it has easy access through the
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.640]   airport.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:04.140]   Now two households working, living in – or two – a couple, both people working, living
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.380]   in New Jersey.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.360]   You can dicker around and get a child and dependent care tax credit if you qualify based
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.480]   upon the income limitations but your maximum tax credit here is $1,200.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.680]   That's the most that you're going to be able to get for dependent and child care credit,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.720]   $1,200.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.920]   You might look down however and notice that you're paying $10,000 to $12,000 a year
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.000]   of property taxes to live in New Jersey.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.360]   You realize that, well, if we just made a simple shift and moved from New Jersey to
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.800]   a state with lower property taxes, which is pretty easy to find, then all of a sudden
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.600]   we could kiss say $8,000 a year of these property taxes goodbye.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.200]   If the employment situation works out where one of the spouse can negotiate a work from
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.440]   home scenario for a part-time pay, living in a different state and the other spouse
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.120]   is on an airplane anyway, you might find the big win.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:02.740]   A lot easier to just simply change property taxes by changing states than it is to try
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.280]   to figure out how can I maximize my dependent care credit.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   If you're eligible for it, take it, but stay focused on the big wins first.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.160]   When you start looking and saying, "Oh, my state income tax, I can change that and
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:26.120]   my property tax level," now all of a sudden you open up more wins for yourself.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.000]   At this point of my knowledge and understanding of tax planning, I am convinced that the big
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.800]   wins of tax planning are all going to be major lifestyle changes and they're not going to
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.040]   be found in lists of deductions and credits.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.960]   I'm going to give you a list of deductions and credits, but the big wins, I'm convinced
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   they're not going to be there.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   I could be wrong.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.520]   If you can prove me wrong, tell me.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.080]   I've never really found somebody who does a good job and can say, "Look, here, Joshua,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.400]   is your approach, so I've made this up from synthesizing information," but I'm convinced
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.020]   they're major lifestyle changes.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:03.040]   By starting with the vision, mission, purpose, then focusing on the aggregate of all the
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:08.480]   different types of taxes, starting there, that's going to be the major wins before
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.360]   we get to the minor wins.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.520]   Now, to keep this continued to be practical, with that as your backdrop, now let's dig
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.360]   into what can you actually do to lower income taxes.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.520]   I'm going to stay focused on federal income taxes.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.420]   The strategies for changing employment taxes are going to involve changing who you work
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.240]   for and how you work.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.400]   That's a different show for another day.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.280]   The strategies of state income taxes are going to involve a very small number of credits
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.480]   and changing states.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.920]   That should be something you should seriously consider, but that's also a show for another
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   day.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   Let's stay focused on federal income taxes.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.120]   Let me give some examples of how we could approach this problem with the backdrop I've
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.520]   given you for young couples.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.800]   Here's the stereotypical case study I'm going to use.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.920]   Here's why I say that the basic situation, that the high-income, dual-income household
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   is a disaster from a tax perspective.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.080]   Pretend I have two attorneys that are married to each other.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.640]   Each of them makes $150,000 a year as employees of a large law firm, so you've got $300,000
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.160]   of total gross income.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:16.800]   Well, that kind of lifestyle for most people is going to lead to a certain consumption
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   pattern.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.840]   It would be an unusual attorney who would drive around a 1998 Toyota Corolla like I
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.840]   do.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.120]   In general, if you're going to be an attorney, you need to maintain your image.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.680]   You need to signal the proper amount of competence for your clients.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.280]   That's going to involve your purchasing a BMW or a Mercedes.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.240]   Can you avoid that?
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.640]   Well, I'm not sure I would because it is important.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.880]   You have to market the appropriate thing.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.440]   You have to put forth that, again, signaling.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.960]   You have to signal how you want to be perceived, and you need to be perceived as successful
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.560]   in your career in order to attract clients, which is the way you make partner, where you
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.920]   go from $150,000 to $1.5 million per year, which is the basic function.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.680]   But what that means is that early in your career, you are purchasing an expensive car.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.040]   Let's say you find a good deal.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   You're still $20,000.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.480]   Well, you're going to incur a sales tax on a $20,000 car, big sales tax.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   You're going to incur a depreciation, $20,000 car.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.680]   This is about as conservative as I can conceive even with talking about a $20,000 car, but
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.880]   big depreciation, $20,000 car.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:29.240]   First of all, all of these expenses are after-tax expenses.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:35.180]   As an employee and as an employed attorney at a large law firm, you're going to have
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.020]   a minimal ability to deduct any personal transportation expenses.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.020]   What else is associated with it?
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.720]   Well, you got to have a certain level of clothes.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.320]   I mean, it's going to mean nice suits.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.720]   Well, those clothes are entirely non-deductible.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.360]   The only type of work clothes that are deductible are specialized work clothes that are needed
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.160]   for a specialized occupation.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.160]   A nice suit for an attorney doesn't count.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.680]   You're going to, based upon your social status as a working professional, you're going to
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.280]   be expected to live a certain lifestyle, which means you need a moderately fancy house or
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.640]   apartment or condo.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.760]   Not much you can do there as far as say tax savings.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.280]   You're going to be expected to engage in a certain lifestyle, drinks after hours, dinners
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.800]   out, a certain level of entertainment, most of which is going to be relatively expensive
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.880]   and all after taxes.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:31.400]   As a junior, considering here a young couple just starting out, as a junior level attorney,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.480]   you're not going to have a substantially padded expense account for you to easily be able
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.800]   to move that entertainment over and deal with that on the corporate credit card.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.300]   So what you have here is you have a relatively high gross income with very few deductions
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:51.240]   and all of the income is going to be front loaded and most of your expenses are non-deductible.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.380]   So you have heavy tax across the board and every one of your tax categories is heavy.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.680]   You're paying high employment taxes because your income is salaried.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.400]   You're paying high income taxes because you have a high household income.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.220]   You have very few deductions that you can put against that.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.840]   You have all of your income is structured as salary so you're not able to take advantage
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.440]   of any capital gains tax rates or dividend tax rates.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:22.040]   This is the problem that employed dual income households face.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.720]   Now I said the big wins are going to be major lifestyle changes, not just in lists of deduction
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   and credits.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   Here would be the example.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.580]   Compare that scenario to the million and next door as outlined in Tom Stanley's books.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:39.020]   Let's assume that instead of being a young attorney, I decide I'm going to be a young
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.020]   house flipper.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.760]   Well, all of a sudden I don't need to drive a BMW or Mercedes.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.480]   I can drive a $6,000 or $8,000 Ford F-150.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.440]   That Ford F-150 is going to be an important part of my business and so as part of that
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:59.280]   business now, it is either a depreciable asset or a deductible expense asset.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.520]   So I can deduct the cost of it right off of my profit.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.160]   Now I don't need to set up a high cost office in a class A office space.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.040]   I can set up a home office.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.260]   Because of the nature of my work, most of my driving now goes from instead of me commuting
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:17.560]   to my inner city attorney office, now most of my driving is going to have some business
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.360]   association to it.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.480]   When I'm driving my pickup truck, I might be going to look at a house.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.800]   I might be going to meet with a contractor.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.720]   I might be going to deal with something like that.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.240]   I can wear a pair of work boots and blue jeans which cost me $4 at the local Goodwill.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:40.280]   I can live in a middle class type of neighborhood instead of having to live in the upper class
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:45.020]   posh neighborhood with all the fancy people because I'm not trying to get my neighbors
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.240]   as my clients and joining the local country club so I can meet prospective legal clients.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.020]   Rather, I'm simply trying to find people who need to rent houses and I can have the most
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:57.260]   comfortable house in my lower middle class or middle class neighborhood instead of having
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.060]   the aspirational house in my aspirational neighborhood.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:06.020]   Because I wear blue jeans and drive an F-150, I can enjoy a Friday night out at the local
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.540]   high school football game with a $6 beer and a $4 hot dog instead of having to go out to
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.620]   the fancy country club.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:19.660]   So even if I made the same net, let's say that I grossed $150,000, even the structure
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.760]   of my company where I can – the structure that I can put in place with my simple house
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.420]   flipping company is going to be much more advantageous from the structure of my income
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.260]   versus the W-2 attorney income.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:40.140]   So even if I just grossed the same amount, $150,000 from a legal job as a junior attorney
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:45.180]   or $150,000 as a house flipper, there's going to be a dramatic difference in lifestyle
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.740]   and taxes based upon that.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.300]   That's why I talk about the big wins going to be major lifestyle changes.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.260]   I hope that's helpful.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.780]   Next, let's go on to applying those strategies and the order of the show in case it's unclear,
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.700]   focusing on the things that have the biggest impact first.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.300]   Now we're moving on to the things that are going to have the medium impact and we'll
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.420]   finish with the list of credits and deductions that are going to have the least impact rather
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.900]   than starting with all the noise of credits and deductions, blah, blah, blah, that has
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.460]   a small impact.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:18.260]   So medium impact, let's apply these timing strategies, shifting strategies and conversion
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.180]   strategies to employees.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.620]   How could we implement this?
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.760]   Well, first, timing strategies.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.940]   Any kind of timing where we are either deferring or accelerating taxable income or deferring
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:38.340]   or accelerating tax deductions in order to take advantage of the lowest tax rates.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.700]   With regard to your income, one of the things that you should think very carefully about
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.380]   is when do we want to actually recognize the income?
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.940]   This start with 401Ks.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.300]   401K, major place to start.
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.900]   I can put $18,000 in a 401K.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.180]   What you're doing is you're deferring the recognition of the $18,000 of income from
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:02.580]   today to a future date and the only reason that you would do this is if you expect to
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:08.220]   be in a lower tax bracket in the future at retirement than you do today.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.980]   Probably that's a reasonable expectation.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:18.420]   Now could you do that with a heavy focus early in your career?
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:24.340]   What most people aren't doing if they're early in their career as employees is focusing first
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.340]   on savings.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.700]   Most people are focusing first on getting their consumption established.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:33.580]   Back to my stereotypical dual attorneys in a household as a simple example.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.580]   Both of them, we're going to get our cars.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.980]   We're out of college now.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.260]   We're tired of being broke students.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.260]   We're going to get our house set up.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.740]   We're going to get our cars set up.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.940]   We're going to get all of our things set up.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.020]   We're going to have our fancy vacations.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:51.620]   What most of those people are doing is they start by focusing on the lifestyle expenditures
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:57.740]   and they don't focus first on the savings and investments.
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:02.860]   What often ends up happening is kids come along and after a while when kids come along,
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.460]   one of the spouses will switch to either part-time or switch to staying at home.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.940]   This is often what happens.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.600]   Even if both spouses don't switch to doing that, there are going to be other expenses
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.860]   and because you start to have kids, there might be some deductions that are associated
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.860]   with that.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:23.620]   What I would love to see people do is substantially reduce their income in the early years by
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:28.100]   investing the maximum in the 401(k) and then as their kids come along and perhaps they
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:33.440]   pull back a little bit from the career track, perhaps they have child credits and things
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:39.500]   like that that are slightly helpful, then go ahead and pull back on the 401(k) contributions
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.860]   and save less in the 401(k).
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   That could be a timing strategy.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.900]   Front load your retirement plan contributions.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:54.100]   If you have – back to the big picture vision, if you don't always intend to be employees
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:59.060]   and most people don't always intend to be employees, usually in most families that I've
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:04.500]   worked with, there's some kind of self-employment career transition that people want to do,
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   do that early.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:11.320]   So instead of both people trying to work in full-time jobs where now you're paying high
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.820]   marginal tax rates on the top levels of income and then at some point in time, we're going
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:20.580]   to have kids and now mom or dad is going to transition to the next job, building the business
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.180]   that can be the part-time business from home, switching from being the employed attorney
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.860]   to being the self-employed attorney, why don't you do that early?
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:35.420]   Take that lower income that it requires to set up a business earlier in life when the
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.300]   marginal tax rate is the highest and adjust the timing and bring that reduction of income
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:43.100]   forward instead of trying to do it when you got a two-year-old in the house and you're
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.360]   going to have lower tax rates because of that transition.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.340]   So use those high-earning years and think like a family unit instead of as business
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.620]   partners.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.500]   When you don't have many deductions to use, renting an apartment perhaps, you don't have
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.540]   mortgage interest deductions, things like that, why not just keep your income low and
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:06.340]   your expenses low and build the business then?
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.380]   You can do the same thing with your investments even if you're not using retirement plans
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.500]   and even if you're not investing in business.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.100]   If you're going to invest in something that's going to require capital expenditure, do that
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.700]   early so that you can use your upfront depreciation expenses which are going to be higher in the
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:26.660]   beginning stages to offset some of your higher earned income.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.060]   This is back to the strategy that my listener mentioned of real estate.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:34.740]   One of the major advantages of real estate is you can enjoy the higher upfront depreciation
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:40.420]   and that depreciation can count against your income from the investment and also potentially
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.520]   against the income from your job.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.620]   So do that early.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.580]   Buy those investments early using that upfront depreciation to offset the high income so
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.180]   that over time you can pivot and instead of needing to live on the high income, you can
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.460]   live off of the – your high earned income.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.260]   You can live off the income from your investments.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.500]   Working a high income job can be an awesome strategy.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:07.780]   That young attorney can – those young attorneys can do a really amazing job with that $300,000
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:13.620]   income and if they just switch from buying BMWs, fancy aspirational middle class – upper
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:19.380]   middle class housing, all of the fancy deals and they focus on buying investments and all
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.500]   of a sudden you take five years of focused effort and they come out the other end with
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:30.100]   five to ten rental houses, that's going to make a massive difference in their overall
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:37.100]   lifetime wealth as compared to the kind of scuzzy looking vehicles, worn out suits, et
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.100]   cetera.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.780]   Now obviously you got to figure out a way to meet the minimum requirements and that's
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:41.940]   up to you.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.980]   But as a concept, that can be a useful scenario.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.540]   Timing of your expenses or your deductible incomes, obviously we talked about funding
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.980]   the retirement accounts early.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:58.860]   From a tax perspective, rather see those retirement accounts funded to the max from an early perspective
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.060]   if you're going to use retirement accounts.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.900]   Consider funding all of the accounts that you have.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.100]   Can you fund five to nine plans early when you can take the deductions if you're going
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.020]   to use five to nine plans, if you're going to be able to get a deduction on your state
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.600]   income taxes?
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.260]   Can you fund your health savings accounts?
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.380]   Fund those early.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.300]   Maximize all of your expenses and deductions.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:23.480]   As an employee, most of your deductions are going to be the freebies, the retirement plans
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.820]   and things like that.
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.500]   Those all have problems associated with them.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.500]   They're locking up the money.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.980]   That's a show for another day.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.300]   There aren't many deductions that you can really, really capitalize on.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.780]   That's what's so limiting about being an employee as compared to a business owner.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.280]   Shifting strategies.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.780]   Shifting strategies always involve how can we shift income from a high-rate taxpayer
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.500]   to a low-rate taxpayer.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.980]   Here there's not much you can do as an employee.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:55.500]   You can't assign the income from your job to your eight-year-old daughter.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.020]   That's not going to work.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:03.500]   You could focus on the state that you live in.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   That's a big deal.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.820]   That would be one way of shifting from one high-tax-rate jurisdiction to a low-tax-rate
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.340]   jurisdiction.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.980]   This would be especially useful to you if you live on an airplane or if you work remotely
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.820]   or if your company has multiple locations.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.940]   Sometimes this could be an easier type of transfer to make.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.780]   Shift from the high-tax-rate state to the low-tax-rate state.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.780]   Look for that.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.020]   Shift from the high-tax-rate county to the low-tax-rate county.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.500]   On expenses, you just want to look to see are there any expenses that you can shift
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.340]   from personal expenses over to the company.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.220]   Simple examples come to mind here.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.220]   Phone.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.980]   Do you pay for a personal phone and you have business on it or does your employer pay for
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.100]   it?
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.300]   The IRS is pretty loose with simple things like an iPhone, iPhones, iPads, things like
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.300]   that.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.780]   So get your employer at least to pay for that phone so that you don't have to pay for it
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.580]   completely yourself.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.660]   Is that going to make a big difference if you're making $300,000 a year?
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.660]   No.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:00.520]   But again, tax planning is all about little things, as many little things as possible.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.920]   Can you arrange and negotiate a company car, sales reps, things like that?
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.980]   That company car, if you're in a service business, even if you're an employee, that company car
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.220]   can be a big benefit for you.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.500]   Your employer by law is required to track your personal use and your business use and
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.900]   to disallow any deductions for any personal use.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.780]   But still, many businesses can be arranged in such a way that you are traveling from
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:28.020]   your home to the job site and therefore the business car is part of your business use.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:33.140]   So look for any way to shift any personal expenses from your bank account over to the
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.740]   company's bank account.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.980]   Finally, conversion strategies.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.260]   Conversion strategies is all about where we can try to convert income from a high tax
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.900]   rate activity to a low tax rate activity.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.220]   First thing is can you convert from salary into ownership?
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:50.660]   Can you participate in some sort of bonus program, stock option program, executive compensation
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.660]   program?
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:56.820]   And rather than recognizing your salary immediately, can you start to transition to the ownership
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:57.940]   perspective?
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.500]   That's going to be a big savings.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.300]   For your expenses, can you switch out some of your expenses and possibly transfer anything
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.180]   over to the company checkbook?
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.540]   For example, if you like to go out to fancy dinners, then go ahead and sign up to be part
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.380]   of the client entertainment team.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.620]   And do your fancy dinners out with clients.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.060]   You can take your spouse along if your client's spouses are present.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:28.300]   The IRS rules on that are that if your spouse's attendance is necessary in order to be appropriate
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.220]   for the situation because the people that you're entertaining for a business purpose
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.820]   also have their spouses along, then that's an okay scenario.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.700]   If not, you would need to pay for your spouse out of pocket and that would be a disallowed
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.380]   business expense.
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.580]   But can you just switch some of your entertainment over and turn it from personal entertainment
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.060]   into business entertainment?
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.940]   Why not do the fancy dinners out?
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.740]   Why not do the baseball games with clients?
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:50.740]   Things like that.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.540]   It can be perfectly enjoyable, can help you to move it over to your expense account.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.280]   Make sure you get all the little ones.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.780]   Take all the tax-free money you can get.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.620]   Take the tax-free airline points.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.940]   Take the tax-free airline miles.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.380]   All of those types of things are a big deal.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:09.660]   If you're paid a per diem allowance on business travel, underspend your per diem.
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.660]   That can be tax-free money that flows into your pocket.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:17.620]   You should just look for whatever is appropriate to your situation.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:22.420]   Now let's go through some specific employee benefits, deductions, credits, things like
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.420]   that.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.300]   Always look for all the tax-free money that you can get.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:30.500]   So for example, maximize the tax-free health insurance premiums that your company is paying
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.500]   for you.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.340]   Get your $50,000 of group term life insurance premium for the company.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.540]   That's tax-free money.
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:43.660]   Get any kind of health plans that you can that are going to be a benefit to you.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:48.560]   Look for the tax-free merchandise that's distributed to the employer.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:54.580]   Make sure that you carefully track all of the appropriate expenses of your employer.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.020]   Simple one, make sure you get your cab fares tracked.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.640]   Make sure that you get your supper money.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:05.280]   If you can arrange to work as an employee – if you can arrange to work from 11 AM
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:13.620]   to 7 PM instead of 9 AM to 5 PM and your employer agrees to pay you supper money because of
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:20.400]   your work hours, then those otherwise personal supper expenses are converted into non-taxable
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   income.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.640]   Simple change could be something that could accumulate over time.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.600]   Again, make sure you get all those benefits that you can with personal phones, computers,
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.240]   etc.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.840]   Take advantage of any meals and lodgings that your employer provides.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:41.400]   If your employer provides, for example, lunch on the premises so that they minimize the
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.480]   time that employees are away, that's a non-taxable fringe benefit.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:51.060]   If your employer doesn't do that, consider investigating that and asking them to do it.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.000]   You have to make sure that it's done for the convenience of the employer so it follows
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.240]   the rules but that can be a substantial win.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:02.040]   So maybe you can start a corporate program like that and that could be substantial.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.040]   How substantial?
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.600]   Well, consider this as an example.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.900]   I'll do some math here to show you what I mean.
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:07.900]   Little things add up.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.220]   Let's assume that you're in the habit of spending $15 a day for lunch, eating out
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.800]   each day on personal expenses.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.720]   Ignore the concept of brown bagging for less.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.800]   Just assume you're in the habit of doing this, going out every day with your coworkers.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:25.520]   Well, $15 per lunch per day times – let's use 220 days of work.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.320]   That comes out to be $3,300 per year that you're spending on lunches.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.880]   Because you're going out with coworkers and you're just simply going out for personal
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:41.600]   lunches, you have to pay for those lunch expenditures with after-tax dollars.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.640]   So that means if you're in a 40% tax bracket with that higher income, take 3,300, divide
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.280]   that up by 0.6 and you wind up with $5,500.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:56.080]   You have to earn $5,500 just to pay for your lunches out every day.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.800]   Now assume you go to your employer and you ask your employer to go ahead and institute
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.880]   some sort of employee lunch program where for the convenience of your employer, your
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.240]   employer serves lunch to all the employees every day.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.840]   That's a valuable fringe benefit which can be fully deductible to the employer and allows
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.400]   you to save the $15 a day.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:19.880]   That's $5,500 that you don't have to earn to put towards that.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:25.840]   Simple, small, but actually powerful in the aggregate.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.440]   You could apply the same thing to coffee.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.600]   A lot of people want to have a fancy coffee.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.800]   Well, a couple of dollars a day for a fancy coffee.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.160]   What about going to your employer and asking them to install the equipment for a coffee
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.440]   bar for the employees?
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.960]   Even if you don't have a barista, what about just getting the equipment?
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.040]   Many employers might be willing to spend a few thousand dollars on fancy equipment.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   You go ahead and get fancy equipment.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:52.120]   Now you can have fancy coffee and ask your employer or negotiate if you're in a leadership
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.120]   position.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.220]   Arrange for a beautiful break place, a nice little outdoor patio seating where employees
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.460]   can go and have fancy coffee together.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:04.560]   That's a material benefit which allows you to minimize your expenditures that are after
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:12.880]   taxes and move them over even as an employee to the business balance sheet.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.760]   Get creative with that.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:20.160]   Make sure you maximize any type of flexible spending accounts or cafeteria plans that
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.400]   are established.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.480]   Perhaps you can encourage and persuade your employer to establish a dependent care assistance
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.120]   program.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:34.840]   The benefits received under that type of program can be substantial to you.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.800]   Maximize your employer educational assistance opportunities.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:43.880]   If they provide for you any type of tuition payment, things like that, that can be extremely
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.840]   valuable.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.360]   Shop for employers carefully based upon that if nothing else.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.240]   Simple example, if you wanted to be an attorney, continue to pick on my attorneys, maybe you
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:54:00.120]   get a job at a law firm that provides reimbursement for law school expenses and you get a job
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.240]   there as a paralegal and you work through and you take advantage of their program.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:12.440]   That would be a deductible expense for the employer and that's tax-free money for you,
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   the employee.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.960]   So if many of your compatriots have to earn – let's say law school costs $100,000.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:25.640]   If many other people have to earn money at a 40% tax rate, so $100,000 divided by 0.6
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.840]   would be $166,000.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:33.720]   So your friends have to earn $166,000 to get the $100,000 out that they can then use to
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:40.600]   pay for school and you can get that as a tax-free benefit by working for a firm as a paralegal
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.000]   and then allowing that firm to pay for law school.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   That could be a useful thing for you to be involved with.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.760]   Maximize any of your employee awards programs.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:57.000]   Get the gold watch, get the pen, set up those programs as part of your employer so that
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.280]   they can benefit you.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.520]   Try to take advantage of any scholarships or awards that you can find.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.920]   Take advantage of any other fringe benefits that your employer provides.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:12.080]   For example, sometimes you might be able to find a system where your employer will move
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.920]   you and will pay a moving allowance as part of your contract.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:21.800]   Well, if you can negotiate that moving allowance and also involve that as something where you
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:28.080]   are purchasing real estate, you could theoretically put together a couple of those things to create
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.880]   tax-free income for yourself.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:37.560]   If your moving allowance offsets some of the costs of your moving and you take advantage
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:44.440]   of the Section 121 tax-free income from the sale of your house, you might be able to put
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.960]   those together to enrich yourself.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:53.600]   If you need to drive to work, put together a carpool association with some of your coworkers.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:59.540]   Award them money, those carpool receipts coming to you are tax-free income.
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:05.180]   As you can see, most of these ideas are things that will involve – many of these ideas
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.080]   are things that will involve negotiation with your employer.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   Something as simple as this.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.960]   Let's say that you travel a lot for business and whenever you travel for business, you
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:21.200]   have to – again, two spouses, husband travels – husband is the one who works at a job
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   that doesn't involve travel.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.280]   The wife is traveling for business.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.920]   Husband's job involves a long commute.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:31.300]   So what happens is the wife's job involves a short commute and so she is able to take
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.340]   care of the dogs when she's home.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.940]   But the husband's job has a long commute.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:39.920]   So on the times when the wife is out traveling, that means that she has to put the dogs in
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.360]   the kennel because – during the day and pay for doggy daycare.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:49.800]   So doggy daycare rates in your area are a total of 20 bucks, 20 bucks per day.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.920]   This happens a total of 40 days per year.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:56.800]   40 times 20 equals $800 per year that you spend in doggy daycare.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.760]   So you're going through that cash flow statement and you're asking yourself, "Is there a
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:06.800]   way that I could change this expense from a taxable expense and shift it over to a non-taxable
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   expense?"
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:12.160]   Well, you look at that and you say that's $800 we're spending and the reason we're
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:16.120]   spending it is because it is part of the travel expenditures.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.760]   Well, it's not going to work to get your employer necessarily to pay you extra for
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.720]   the doggy daycare, although check it out.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:27.760]   But maybe you could convince your husband at his company to lobby for a dog-friendly
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.640]   work environment so that he can just simply take the dog with him to work.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:40.720]   Well, $800 that otherwise was an after-tax expenditure that meant that you had to earn
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:48.240]   $1,333 pre-taxes at a 40% aggregate rate to pay for that expense.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:54.640]   Well, just simply him going in and asking to change the company into a dog-friendly
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.880]   environment where he can take the dog to work is going to make a big, big difference.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:04.240]   That's $1,333 that you don't have to earn in order to cover that expense.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:09.320]   Now you can go through more and more lists of all the deductions, the above-the-line
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:15.160]   deductions, below-the-line deductions, your child and dependent care tax credits, moving
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.160]   expenses.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.160]   You can go through the list of those.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.520]   But from here, all of those deductions are all going to be equally applicable to business
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.560]   owners or employees.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:30.560]   Hopefully you see at least the process that you can apply to personal tax planning.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.200]   It's a lot, but it's also just a system of little things.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:38.960]   But I'm going to close with reiterating the thing that my listener mentioned even
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.280]   in the comment.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.360]   Well, two things actually that my listener mentioned even in the comment.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:49.380]   Number one, you heard me at the beginning when reading his email talk about calculating
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.320]   is it worth it for the second spouse to work.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.880]   I would challenge you, any of you listening, whether you're married, whether you're
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:02.200]   not, whether there's one income, whether there's multiple incomes, go through the
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:08.640]   income calculations and figure out the true income per hour and figure out what it actually
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.280]   costs you to work.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:19.800]   If you compare the expenditures that I went through as an example with my attorney example,
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.600]   the young aggressive attorneys working through these things, if you were to go through those
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:30.240]   lists of expenses of what it actually costs to be a young attorney and all of those lifestyle
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:35.040]   expenses associated with it, the long hours, the billable hours, things like that, you
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.560]   would find that the actual rate per hour, if you take the gross income, pull out the
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:44.740]   costs of working, the costs of lunches, the costs of the BMW, etc.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:49.440]   If you pull out the rate per hour, it's actually much lower than it seems at first
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.420]   glance.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.080]   Many of you listening would love that lifestyle.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.080]   For me, I would hate it.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.380]   I'd rather do what I'm doing now, which is work in a pair of shorts and a t-shirt
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:04.160]   every day and drive a $500 car because I enjoy this type of lifestyle much more than
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.160]   I would enjoy the other.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.760]   It's a free world, sort of.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.620]   You do what you want.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:13.060]   But recognize the costs and if you run those calculations and you actually sit down and
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:17.720]   figure out what is the incremental tax rate, you might find the opportunity to do something
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   different.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.800]   I'm going to read here in closing one of my favorite emails that I've ever gotten
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.000]   from a listener of the show.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.820]   This email says this, "I've been meaning to tell you, Joshua, about some exciting
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.640]   changes in our family, much due to the inspiration from your show.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.220]   After the inspiration to track expenses, cash flow, taxes, etc., and after reading the book
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:41.020]   you recommended, How to Pay Zero Taxes, I realized that my wife did not need to be working.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:44.820]   She put in her notice one month ago and will begin as a stay-at-home mom on Monday.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.020]   She's thrilled.
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:50.220]   Through tax savings credits and reductions in income-based payments to student loans,
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:55.580]   I discovered nearly $30,000 in savings right away for her not working.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.180]   In addition, we can enjoy more home cooking, slow living, and hopefully less stressful
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.360]   purchasing.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.620]   Some example savings.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:05.980]   Previous work expenses were $5,000 per year of the cost of actually working.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.620]   Pay as you earn student loan payments, $6,000.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.940]   Taxes, $7,000.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:14.980]   Savers credit, we now can get an additional $2,000 tax credit because of the lower income.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.940]   And an IRA contribution for both of us saves us $3,000 of additional tax.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:25.140]   Long story short, I discovered savings of nearly $30,000 for her not working.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.260]   Now instead of three hours of getting the family ready, sitting in traffic and getting
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.220]   to work late, I can wake up at 5 a.m., get on the express bus and be at work by 6 a.m.,
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:37.220]   getting home much earlier, all while they sleep in, have a casual breakfast, and enjoy
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.220]   life.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.100]   Thank you for the inspiration and your shows on stay-at-home parenting.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.260]   It's made a great difference in our lives."
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:48.980]   That is one of my favorite emails that I've ever gotten from the show because I see this
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:53.500]   as a very doable thing for many people.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.980]   The reason that I close with this email is to demonstrate to you that the major savings
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:03.740]   and the major lifestyle improvements are not found on a list of IRS Form 1040 deductions
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.500]   and credits.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:10.220]   I hammered that point home throughout this show by starting with the things that are
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.220]   most impactful, moving to less impactful, and moving to least impactful, which are deductions
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.220]   and credits.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.900]   In short, consider your lifestyle.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:26.540]   The modern U.S. American lifestyle for many people, especially many people in this situation,
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.140]   flat out sucks.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:35.820]   I think it's well characterized by that Facebook meme that goes around of a picture of massive
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.300]   gridlock on the highway.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.860]   I'm sitting in a car that I don't own on my way to...
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:46.100]   I'm sitting in traffic in a car that I don't own, driving on my way to work at a job that
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.580]   I don't like, to pay for a house that I don't get to live in because I'm sitting in this
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.780]   car in traffic on the highway going along the way.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.180]   I got to do this so that I can pay for...
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:01.540]   You bring it into dual income households and you say, "I've got to do this so that my spouse
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.660]   can be doing the same thing.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.300]   We've got to get up early to take our kids to daycare so that we can pay with after-tax
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.580]   money someone else to take care of our kids, or so that we can pay our property taxes so
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.980]   that we can hire people to babysit our kids."
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:14.980]   It sucks.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.740]   The lifestyle sucks.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:22.100]   Whoever sold us a bill of goods that you should determine your self-worth based upon the amount
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:27.900]   of your income as measured in dollars, sorry, I don't buy it anymore.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.300]   The whole concept of work, work, work, work, work so that you can spend, spend, spend,
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.340]   spend, spend so that you can save a little bit of money so hopefully someday maybe you'll
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:41.020]   be able to retire and play golf every day is stupid.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.580]   I'm not playing that game.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.740]   Now it's not either or.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:47.980]   It's not you got to be broke and poor and make $10,000 a year just so you can be happy.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.820]   I fully intend to make millions of dollars a year.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.820]   That's the plan.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.380]   I got the business plan for it.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:01.220]   But that business plan is built out of mission, purpose, values, what I started with the show,
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.940]   and then it's built on lifestyle, and then it goes finally to tactics.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:11.740]   If you're in the right place so that you're able to actually make these things happen,
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.140]   go for it.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:18.100]   But consider as you're looking at saving taxes, is it really worth it?
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:21.500]   Should I make some big change or should I make the little changes and then do both of
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.980]   them?
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.700]   That would be how I would answer the question.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.980]   Hope this content is useful to you.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:31.540]   I felt a little bit off of my game and a little bit off my timing.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.920]   I think I've done so many interview shows lately it's been tough for me to get back
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.820]   on my timing but I'm working on it.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.900]   So if this show is a little bit flat, let me know.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.900]   I am working on it.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:44.260]   A couple of things as we go, a couple of announcements.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:49.140]   Number one, that email that I received from that listener, if Radical Personal Finance
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.900]   has helped you, would you do me a favor and just email me and let me know?
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.940]   It's so helpful and it's especially helpful.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:59.540]   I am launching the details of the coaching program that I'm starting, personal coaching.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.180]   I'll go over that on a future day.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.420]   But I'd really love to have more emails like that to just simply share with people as part
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.700]   of testimonials that I can show.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:11.380]   I will clear your name from it.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:14.820]   I'll redact your name so that it's private or something like that.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.120]   But if you're okay with my sharing your name, that would be helpful too.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.660]   But I'd love to get some emails from you guys.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:23.220]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com if any of the content on the show has been helpful.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.980]   Or of course you can leave the iTunes reviews.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.940]   Those are super useful and helpful as well.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:32.020]   Remember that if you are a patron of the show on Thursday, what did I say?
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.020]   At one o'clock.
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.020]   Where's my calendar?
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.460]   At one o'clock Eastern, there is a conference call for all patrons of the show.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.220]   I have two hours blocked on my calendar.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:44.260]   I intend to answer as many questions as possible and have a conference call.
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.260]   You can dial into that.
