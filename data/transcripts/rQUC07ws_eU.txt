[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140]   Another goal this year that's a little new from last year is that when cash back is more efficient than points, I'm willing to do that.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.900]   It would have been crazy when I recorded the 2024 version of this episode almost 18 months ago to think about getting cash back.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.860]   For some reason, I was just so wired to focus on points.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:26.820]   But I think my mindset is that if I'm getting points instead of cash back, then I'm effectively just buying those points at whatever the rate is based on what cash back I would have gotten.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:36.640]   So for example, if I'm spending money on just something that gets no bonus on any card, obviously I could be using my Venture X card, get 2X points on everything.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:47.320]   But I also have a Bank of America card with Platinum Honors, which is their program that elevates all of their rewards based on how many dollars you have on deposit at Bank of America,
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:56.040]   which brings up their unlimited cash and their travel rewards and their premium rewards cards all the way up to 2.625% cash back.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   And if you want to go deeper on that, I'll link to an episode in the show notes on the best cashback cards.
