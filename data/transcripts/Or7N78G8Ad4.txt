[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   A podcast listener named Brooke has today's question. It's short and to the point. Hello,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.600]   Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast. My question for you is simply, what does the
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.080]   Apostle Paul mean when he says that we are to judge angels in 1 Corinthians 6.3? Can
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.520]   you explain this text and its context?
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:34.520]   The context of the question is whether Christians should use law courts, secular law courts,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.880]   to settle matters with each other, whether they should sue each other in secular court.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.160]   Let me read it to you, 1 Corinthians 6.1-3, "When one of you has a grievance against another,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.520]   does he dare to go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? Or do you not know
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.600]   that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.200]   incompetent to try trivial cases? Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.520]   more than matters pertaining to this life?"
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.660]   The first commentary I glanced at on this said this, "But exactly how we shall judge
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:30.680]   angels is not revealed to us." Now that's true, but we're not left without any help
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.000]   in Scripture. This is pointing to something absolutely mind-boggling when he says we will
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.180]   judge angels. And we would do well to reflect on it, which is what I enjoy doing, getting
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.520]   ready to answer this.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.600]   Scholars disagree about whether the angels here are good angels or bad angels, angels
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.400]   who haven't fallen and are sinless, and angels who have fallen and are in the category
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.760]   of demons now. But it does seem strange to me that this would be a reference here to
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.480]   absolutely sinless angels, since the context has to do with sorting out what is right and
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   wrong among Christians who have sinned against each other and are going to law to get it
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.760]   sorted out. That's not the sort of thing you would need if you were dealing with sinless
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.080]   angels, it seems like.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:42.540]   So perhaps the reference is to judging angels, namely demonic spirits who had played a role
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:52.880]   in your life and had tempted you and battered you, and you can become a witness at their
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:02.080]   final condemnation by saying, "This is how I experienced demonic assault," so that you
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:11.160]   are a witness to their increasing guilt. That's a possibility. But I think greater things
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.680]   are being pointed to in this verse, and it's the greater thing that I want to mention especially.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.160]   Remember, Jesus said, "God has given him, son of man, all authority," or authority,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.240]   "to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man," John 5:27. In other words, if we
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.520]   have any role in judgment at all, we humans, it will be a participation in the rights and
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.240]   the authority of Jesus, the Son of Man, who has supreme authority as the judge of all
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.200]   things in this universe, because God has imparted it to him. And that is the most stupendous
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.320]   thing about this text, and others like it. Whatever the specifics are, the implication
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:08.480]   is we are being elevated to a status and a role in the coming ages that surpasses our
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.520]   present nature like the ocean surpasses a thimble full of water. Here's what I mean.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.880]   In Revelation 3:21, Jesus says to the saints, "The one who overcomes, I will grant him
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat with my Father on his throne." Sit
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:42.680]   with Jesus on the throne of God who rules the universe? Try to let that sink in. And
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:50.520]   in Revelation 2:26, Jesus gives a specific example with the promise, "The one who conquers,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.600]   who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations." Paul
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:08.280]   puts it like this in 2 Timothy 2:12, "If we endure with him, we will reign with him."
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.820]   So the spectacular thing about being told that we will judge angels is not mainly the
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.960]   specific ways that that will take place, but the inexpressible greatness of the status,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.600]   the position given to ordinary people like you and me, ordinary people of God to actually
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.240]   share in the functions of the judge of the universe.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.880]   Now I think this really sheds light on a very puzzling couple of verses in Ephesians 1.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   At least they used to puzzle me a lot, and I don't presume to have everything right
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.840]   and clear and full about them, but consider this. This is verses 22 and 23 of Ephesians
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:09.040]   1. It says, "And God put all things under Jesus' feet and gave him as head over all
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:22.960]   things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all." So
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.320]   the first thing he says is that all things are under the feet of Jesus. He's the absolute
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:38.200]   judge, absolute ruler over all things. And then, as such, it says that Jesus is given
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.840]   as head to the churchâ€”head, that is, in the sense that the church is the rest of his
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.400]   body. So he's got a head and he's got a body attached to his head, so he's not whole.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.240]   So now you have a head with all authority over all things, possessing a body, which
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:08.120]   is the church of millions of believers, and then he says, "This body is the fullness
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:16.000]   of him who fills all in all." Now what could that possibly mean? That the church, as the
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:26.560]   body of the ruler of the universe, fills it all. My suggestion is that the way Jesus fills
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:34.800]   the universe is with his rule and his control and his judgment, and he does this by means
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:43.480]   of his body, who share in that rule and control and judgment, sitting on the very throne with
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:50.800]   Jesus. So the fullness of the influence and the presence of the Son of Man filling the
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:59.960]   universe is the presence and the action and the judgment of his people, positioned perfectly
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.400]   in every way for their greatest joy and his greatest glory.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.800]   So my answer to Brooke is that even though I may not know the specifics of how we will
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:20.400]   judge angels, the truth of this text is a breathtaking exaltation of ordinary believers
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:29.760]   that should fill us with a continual sense of wonder and awe and hope and joy and confident
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:38.740]   engagement in helping others live this way, especially believers who are in conflict with
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:45.800]   each other and are being tempted to settle that conflict with worldly means rather than
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.120]   Spirit-filled Christians.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.000]   Glories upon glories upon glories here, just speechless listening to you expound all of
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.800]   them. Thank you, Pastor John, for this answer. And Brooke, thank you for getting us here

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.840]   Well every once in a while we get emails in the inbox that just leave me just speechless,
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.440]   dumbfounded, because they arrive with not only a pointed question, but with very real
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:35.960]   life hurt and pain behind the question, seeking genuine answers to alleviate very deep, core
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.120]   identity struggles. Like the email we're going to field on Wednesday when we return, it's
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.480]   an email from a young woman who is the product of IVF. And her biological father was a donor
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.200]   she's never met, and she was just told about it. And now she feels like a part of her was
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.320]   sold as a commodity and it's having damaging effects on her search for her own identity.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.980]   You won't want to miss this one, it will have connections more broadly to really anyone
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.640]   who's been adopted or conceived through any form of reproductive technology. That is on
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.320]   Wednesday when we return. I'm your host Tony Reinke and we will see you then.
