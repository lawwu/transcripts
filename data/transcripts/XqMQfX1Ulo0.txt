[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   Hello, everyone.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.120]   Well Pastor John's new book, Coronavirus and Christ, is now available in 20 languages,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.240]   including American Sign Language, and soon to be in 29 total languages, with the potential
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.800]   for even more languages to be added in the near future.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.560]   It's been very encouraging to see how fast this book has been translated and how far
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.380]   it has reached across the world in such a short time.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.540]   Here in the States, we've seen pastors buying cases of the book and putting them on a table
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.320]   outside the front of their church building so that members could drive up through the
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.820]   week and take a free copy.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.040]   We've seen family and friends posting links to the free book and the free audiobook online.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.120]   It's been amazing to watch the DG community help us spread word online and offline.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.840]   Thank you so much.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.560]   So many encouraging updates have been arriving by the day, but of course, not all the updates
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.200]   have been positive.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.920]   This week, a major news outlet reported on the book in a story of a US Army chaplain
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.880]   under fire for commending the book.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.920]   Senior Army Chaplain Colonel Moon H. Kim.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.460]   He's the US Army's command chaplain based in South Korea.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.560]   He apparently passed along an email to the Coronavirus and Christ book, passed it along
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.460]   to fellow military chaplains, commended the book to them, and for it, got severely criticized.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.800]   No criticized, there's now a call for him to be disciplined and even possibly court-martialed.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.680]   In a letter to the Secretary of Defense published online from an organization called the Military
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.580]   Religious Freedom Foundation, accuses the chaplain of "an absolutely egregious and deplorable
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.440]   act."
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.360]   It says that in sharing the book, he gave a "full-fledged endorsement in validation of
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.040]   what the book espouses and proclaims."
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.980]   The letter recommends that Kim be "officially, swiftly, aggressively, and visibly investigated
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.020]   and disciplined in punishment for his deplorable actions."
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.580]   That is for commending your book to fellow chaplains because what you write is, the letter
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.120]   says, "unmitigated drivel."
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.720]   The letter to the Secretary of Defense is remarkable because of how much of your book
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.800]   it actually quotes, at least 10 citations in the letter.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.400]   As you read this response, what do you think of how you're quoted and interpreted, and
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.120]   is the letter a fair interpretation of your book?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.840]   Well, Tony, some of it is.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.120]   I think it would be fair to say that some of my views about what the Bible teaches,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.600]   even rightly understood, the author of that letter hates.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.440]   He hates what I think.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:50.520]   They are, he says, "incendiary, bigoted, vulgar," not just because he misunderstands,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.480]   but because in part, because he does understand, and that's how he thinks and feels about some
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680]   of what the Bible teaches.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:09.240]   For example, the truth of Romans 5:16, that not only some death, but all death, including
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.320]   yours, Tony, and mine, is the result of God's judgment on the human race because sin entered
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.920]   the world.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.680]   Or second, that God is sovereign over the coronavirus and sends it and ends it when
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   he wills.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.760]   Or third, that homosexual intercourse is a sin.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:39.840]   Or fourth, that the coronavirus is a call for repentance to all of us, all of us, to
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.640]   bring our lives into alignment with the infinite worth of Jesus.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.520]   I think the author of that letter considers all of those views as wrong.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   That's putting it mildly.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.440]   I mean, his language is very colorful.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.680]   While I consider all of those views to be true because they are what the Bible teaches,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   and therefore they're very valuable to know.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.760]   So I think it's not just that he misunderstands, but that he gets some things right in those
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.720]   quotes and he just doesn't like them, period.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.560]   And obviously there are places where the author of this letter gets your meaning wrong.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   Take us through those areas.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.920]   What do you see?
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:37.080]   Well, I see at least three things that the letter and the interview with one of the news
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.040]   outlets gets wrong about the book.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:49.560]   For example, when I say some people will be infected with the coronavirus as a specific
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.440]   judgment from God because of their sinful attitudes and actions, he assumes that I know
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.360]   who those people are, or at least what kind of people they are.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.720]   But here's what I write on page 72.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.300]   And if anybody wants to just check it out, there's pages 69 to 72 are the real ones he's
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.880]   after and they can go look.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.200]   But here's what I say in the summing up of that little chapter.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:27.240]   The coronavirus is never a clear and simple punishment on any person.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   The most loving, Spirit-filled Christian whose sins are forgiven through Christ may die of
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.280]   the coronavirus disease.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:45.840]   But it is fitting that every one of us search our own heart to discern if our suffering
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.240]   is God's judgment on the way we live."
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.480]   In other words, God does judge people with sickness.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.280]   That's very clear from 1 Corinthians 11.32.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   And there it's even talking about Christians.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:09.200]   But I can'tâ€”John Piper and you or anybody else can't determine from outside who is experiencing
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:17.480]   the coronavirus as judgment in a punitive sense and who's experiencing it, say, as purification
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.440]   or who's experiencing it for other reasons that God may have.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   My point was God does do all these things and all of us should do sober-minded self-assessment
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.680]   to discern as well as we can what God's purposes are in all that happens to us.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.920]   And I take the Bible, the Christian scriptures, as the main guide in these things, and the
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.960]   author of this letter apparently doesn't.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.040]   And there's the big canyon between our worldviews.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.520]   Yeah, that's a really important point.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.720]   You said there were three misunderstandings.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.160]   It seems that one of those obviously is the question over homosexuality.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   Right.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:16.080]   You could say probably that that issue is a specific instance of the first misunderstanding.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.840]   As far as I can see, the author of that letter wants to say that Piper thinks every person
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:32.760]   who engages in homosexual acts and who gets the coronavirus is being punished by God for
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.640]   those acts.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.320]   And my response is, well, no, it's not that simple.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.780]   For sure, in Romans 1:27, the Bible says that living in homosexual behavior is sometimes
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:51.720]   punished by God with a "due penalty," which could be a disease.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.360]   But not always.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:02.080]   And sometimes disease comes not as punishment, but as a merciful wake-up call that results
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.880]   in repentance and reconciliation and hope.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.200]   God's ways are simply more complex than the letter acknowledges.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:22.400]   So I say again from page 72, "The coronavirus is never a clear and simple punishment on
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.640]   any person."
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   It may be punishment.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.200]   It may not be.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:37.640]   And our prayer should be that all of us experience our suffering as redemptive, not punitive.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:46.600]   I suspect, though, Tony, I suspect that this clarification won't even come close to satisfying
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:55.360]   the author of this letter, since he considers it drivel and vulgar to even suggest that
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.960]   God controls this disease and would judge anyone with it.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.080]   Yeah, you're exactly right.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.140]   And in the Christian Post interview, one of the rhetorical questions the author of this
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:12.520]   letter poses, and it's used as a kind of unanswerable argument against your view, is
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   this, he says, "What are you supposed to tell a couple that has a gay child who also has
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   COVID?
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.720]   Well, this is your due penalty.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.120]   It's just horrible and wrong."
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.280]   How would you respond to that specific argument that he raises?
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:34.820]   Well, actually, that is the third mistake I was referring to earlier.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:44.400]   He thinks that if you believe what I do, you can't possibly have any good news for someone
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.880]   who is dying of a disease that came to them because of their sin.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   Now, that's the objection in this letter I care about most.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.080]   Actually, it wasn't in the letter, it was in the interview.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.520]   And that's the one I care about most.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.560]   When I read that, I thought, "Okay, even though he states this sarcastically or cynically
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:09.960]   as though there couldn't possibly be any answer to it, I thought, "I want to take that question
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.180]   seriously," because it's a very good pastoral question.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:23.700]   But his viewpoint about what I think or would be able to say is so wrong.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:31.740]   It's wrong at the very point where God's sovereign grace shines most brightly.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.660]   Two thousand years ago, in Jerusalem, the Jewish King Herod, the Roman governor Pontius
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:46.460]   Pilate, the angry crowds, the brutal soldiers, all of them combined to kill Jesus Christ,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.000]   the Son of God.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.460]   But here's the all-important fact.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:58.060]   That horrorâ€”and crucifixion is a horrible thing, especially when it's done to the most
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.420]   innocent person that ever lived and the most glorious person that ever livedâ€”that horror
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.140]   was not a random historical event.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:18.140]   The Bible says in Acts 4:27 that God predestined it and His hand brought it to pass.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.300]   Why?
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.820]   Because He loved His enemies.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.820]   He loved them.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:30.260]   We should say He loved us, all of us who are His enemies, enough that He didn't spare His
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:38.820]   own Son, His only infinitely loved Son, but gave Him up for us.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.340]   Romans 8:32.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.900]   That was love when that happened, according to Romans 5:8.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:50.940]   God shows His love for us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:59.660]   In other words, we have the best news in the world for someone who has lived in a homosexual
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:07.660]   lifestyle or homosexual behaviors and who is dying of COVID-19, and it's the same news
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:14.740]   that I would bring to any other sinner who is dying of COVID-19, including myself.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:22.460]   It is what I want to hold on to when I die, perhaps, of COVID-19, being old like I am
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.900]   with compromised lungs.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.340]   I'm not out of this thing yet.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:32.420]   Maybe I'll be on the deathbed, and I'll be bringing all of my thousands of sins before
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.220]   the judge of the universe.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.700]   What I'm going to do, and my answer is I'm going to hold on to the very same message,
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:46.180]   the grace, the good news that I'm going to bring to the person that this author says
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.380]   I don't have anything to say to.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:57.620]   Jesus said to the thief on the cross who had spent a lifetime in sinning, just hours before
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:03.080]   he died, He looked over to Jesus and said, "Have mercy.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.180]   Remember me when you come into your kingdom."
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:11.180]   And Jesus said, "Today, you will be with me in paradise."
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.740]   Are you kidding me?
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.220]   I mean, this has got to be like a bolt of lightning out of the blue.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.740]   Can that possibly be true, Jesus?
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.300]   You're really going to forgive in this split second before I die?
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.620]   All my sins.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:30.740]   That's how great God's grace is for those who repent and trust Him.
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:41.140]   So Tony, I hope the world hears we have a spectacularly wonderful news for all sinners
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:47.660]   who are dying, however they are dying, whatever they are dying from, whatever sins they have
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.220]   committed.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.060]   And the news in a nutshell is this.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.980]   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.580]   Turn to Jesus Christ.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.340]   He died for sinners like you and me.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.500]   Trust Him.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:13.580]   And you can know that your suffering is not the punitive judgment of God.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.220]   You can know this.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.820]   You can know this as you die.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.500]   I'm not being punished now.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.420]   I won't be punished later.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.060]   How can you know that?
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:32.900]   As Jesus said in John 5, 24, these amazing words, "Whoever hears my word and believes
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:38.740]   Him who sent me has eternal life.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:46.660]   He does not come into judgment, but has passed already."
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.560]   That thief on the cross, he passed while he was hanging on the cross.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.820]   He passed from death to life.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:02.900]   A dying person, any dying person can know the sweet voice of God in Romans 8, 1.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:09.580]   There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:17.140]   So when this letter asks, "Where's the pastoral care and comfort in that belief?"
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:23.900]   Namely, Piper's belief and the belief of this accused chaplain, "Where's the care and comfort
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.900]   in that?"
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.940]   And then answers, "There is none."
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.780]   That's what he says, "There's none."
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:38.060]   My response is, "Sir, no, you are profoundly wrong.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:45.380]   We have the best news in the world for the hardest moments in the world.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:53.180]   The best care, the best comfort, the very heart of Christianity is that through Christ,
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.140]   God rescues guilty sinners."
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.420]   That's me and you and all of us.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:07.300]   Through Christ, God rescues guilty sinners from His own wrath.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:14.580]   Romans 5, 9, "Since therefore we have now been justified by the blood of Christ, much
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.740]   more shall we be saved by Him from the wrath of God."
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:27.500]   That's what God sent Christ to do, rescue us from His own righteous punishment.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.940]   Amen.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.820]   That is the best news in the world.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:36.660]   And it's what motivates us even now to do ministry in this hard time, to get the book
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.740]   translated as far and wide as possible.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.260]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.260]   You're welcome.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.220]   At the beginning of today's episode, I mentioned the "Coronavirus and Christ" book is now
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:51.180]   available in 20 languages, including American Sign Language, and soon to be in 29 total
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.420]   languages, with the potential for even more to be added in the near future.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:00.500]   You can find links to all those translated versions at DesiringGod.org or get there by
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.380]   Googling the title "Coronavirus and Christ" by John Piper.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.380]   It's truly remarkable.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.740]   You see that list of translations and how quickly this international publishing project
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.540]   came together.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.040]   Praise God and praise the Savior for His grace over all of it.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.740]   And thank you for listening to this special episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.420]   We'll see you next time.
