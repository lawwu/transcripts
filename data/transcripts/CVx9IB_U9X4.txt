[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   That's all that matters, that he got there,
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.600]   that he got to the place to act like a fighter,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.480]   to do what we want him to do, to be ready to persevere,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.360]   to go beyond the comfort level, to do another round.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.120]   He didn't want to, damn right he didn't want to,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.280]   but he knew we want him to,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.920]   and he knew in order to pass the test, he had to do it.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.880]   He goes, "Now it's gonna be your job
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.620]   "to get him in the gym, make him mentally stronger,
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.560]   "make him face things, and teach him how to slip punches."
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.600]   And create holes, and fill those freaking holes
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.060]   with devastating punches, this is a classic.
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.280]   With punches with bad intentions.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.840]   - The following is a conversation with Teddy Atlas,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.880]   a legendary, and at times controversial,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.840]   boxing trainer and commentator.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.120]   When I was going to this conversation with Teddy,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.320]   I was ready to talk boxing.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.040]   Styles, matches, techniques, tactics,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.240]   and his analysis of individual fighters
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.120]   like Mike Tyson, Michael Moore, Klitschko's,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.600]   Usyk, Pawecki, Lomachenko, Triple G, Canelo,
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.920]   Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Hagler,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.640]   Duran, Floyd, and on and on and on.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.540]   Like I said, I came ready to talk boxing,
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.240]   but I stayed for something even bigger.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.320]   The Shakespearean human story of Teddy Atlas,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.680]   Customato, and Mike Tyson.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.640]   It's a story about loyalty, betrayal,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.120]   fear, and greatness.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.320]   It's a story where nobody is perfect,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.640]   and everybody is human.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.440]   To summarize, in the early '80s,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.240]   young trainer Teddy Atlas worked with his mentor,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.880]   Customato, in training the young boxing protege,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.600]   now a boxing legend, Mike Tyson.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.680]   Mike was a troubled youth, arrested over 40 times,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.080]   and at age 15, he was sexually inappropriate
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.680]   with Teddy's 11-year-old niece.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   In response to this, Teddy put a .38 caliber handgun
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.640]   to Tyson's ear and told him to never touch his family again,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.720]   or he would kill him if he did.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.400]   For this, Customato kicked Teddy out.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.720]   Why?
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.300]   Well, that's complicated.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.040]   In part, I think to help minimize the chance
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.240]   of Mike Tyson, who Cust legally adopted,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.820]   would be taken away by the state,
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.720]   and with him, the dream of developing
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.680]   one of the greatest boxers of all time.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.940]   Of course, that summary doesn't capture
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.640]   the full complexity of human nature
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.280]   and human drama involved here.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.440]   For that, you have to listen to this conversation,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.600]   the things said and the things left unsaid,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.560]   the pain in Teddy's voice,
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.920]   the contradictions of love and anger
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.140]   that permeate his stories and his philosophy on life.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.440]   Like I said, I came to talk about boxing
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.540]   and stayed to talk about life.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.240]   This conversation will stay with me for a long time.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.520]   The people close to you, the people you trust,
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.760]   the people you love, are everything.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.480]   And if they betray you and break your heart, forgive them.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.900]   Forgive yourself and try again.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.920]   Happy holidays, everyone.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.800]   I love you all.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.560]   This is "Alex Friedman Podcast."

[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.120]   in the description.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.080]   And now, dear friends, here's Teddy Atlas.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.680]   You wrote in the book that your father
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.800]   had a big influence on your life.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.020]   What lessons have you learned about life from your father?
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.920]   - When you ask that question, you know,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   I remember Coach D'Amato, when I was with him
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.520]   up in Gadsden for all those years,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.200]   he used to say to me, "Teddy, you learn through osmosis."
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.880]   I believe that's true to that, if I know what osmosis is.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.040]   (laughing)
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.640]   But it sounds good.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.960]   But I learned through osmosis with my father.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.880]   He wasn't a big talker, he was, you know, he was a doer.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.360]   And when you're around someone who lives
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.720]   a certain kind of life and does certain things,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.080]   it penetrates.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.360]   - He was a doctor.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.720]   - He was, I'm gonna sound like an idiot right now
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.280]   because I'm being a son, but he was the greatest
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   magnetistic doctor, I mean, if I say I ever knew,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.640]   what's that mean?
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.960]   You know what I mean, are you a doctor?
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.760]   You know what I mean, like, what does that mean?
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.520]   But other people have told me this.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.120]   Like, just legendary stories.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.880]   - He would do house calls and he would help people,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   and like you said, a lot of people have spoken about
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.600]   the impact he's had on their life.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.920]   - He built two hospitals.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.680]   And he built a hospital before the Verrazano Bridge
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.760]   in New York, connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   And he built it so people could get proper hospital care
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.240]   they couldn't afford it, period.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.600]   And everybody looked at him as eccentric.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.240]   - Yeah, nice.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.920]   - Yeah, because he would literally sneak patients,
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.640]   not sneak 'em in, he was Dr. Atlas.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.160]   He could do what he wanted to a certain extent,
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.600]   but he would bring patients in without administering,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.720]   putting through administration, so there was no charge
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.960]   because they didn't have anything.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.720]   They were street people.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.000]   I remember being, my only way to be with my father
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.160]   was to go on house calls, or to go to the door.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.240]   There was no, you know, and so I went on house calls with him.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.680]   And he did house calls, by the way, 'til he was 80.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.760]   And three dollars, I mean, it was better than McDonald's,
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.720]   you know what I mean, I mean, the deal.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.280]   Three dollars, and you got medicine, you got everything.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.040]   But he used to, right around the holidays,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.480]   there was just certain things that I didn't understand,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.560]   but I understood later, where we would just
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.000]   drive certain areas, and he'd just,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.680]   all of a sudden, open his door.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.640]   He would pick up things, and you know.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.300]   - Help him. - I'm 10 years old.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.920]   - Yeah. - You know, move over.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.280]   Move over, you know, and.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.000]   - It's just you, him, and a homeless guy.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.800]   - A couple. - Yeah, a couple.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.160]   - Whatever he can fit in, three, four, you know,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.120]   whatever it was.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   - That's a big heart.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.760]   - And then he took him to the hospital, dropped him off.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.480]   So, you know, I would ask questions
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.520]   after it was all over with.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.000]   I'd say, "Dad, they're sick."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.800]   He goes, "Well, not in a way,
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.400]   "whether you put them in the hospital."
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.080]   So, he said, yeah, and he'd try to explain things to me.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.200]   You know, he would try, he didn't talk much
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.600]   unless you asked him something.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.860]   - Yeah. - And that kind of works.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.320]   And, you know, don't talk unless someone asks you something.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   - Yeah. - And he explained to me that,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.080]   he said, "Well, why are you putting them in the hospital?"
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.320]   Then, you know, and of course the sickness was,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.480]   they were alcoholics.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.160]   But, "Why are you putting them?"
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.840]   It wasn't an alcohol rehab, you know?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.920]   So, "Why are you putting them?"
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.080]   And it wasn't for the purpose to dry out.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.360]   He wasn't trying to cure them.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.560]   - Yeah. - Let's put that first
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.400]   before we anoint him for sainthood, you know,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.240]   by Teddy Atlas.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.520]   So, I was like, we finally get to the point.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.560]   Why you put them in there?
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.760]   - Yeah.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.720]   - Well, because it's the holidays.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.120]   All right, why you put them in there?
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.680]   Well, the holidays, you know,
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.200]   are good for certain people and bad for others.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.600]   And it was always before the holidays.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.720]   It was before Christmas, before whatever.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.240]   And New Year's, whatever.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.700]   And so, I said, "Why?"
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.080]   And he said, "Because they remind people,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.200]   "certain people, of what they don't have."
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.080]   That other people enjoy the holidays
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.960]   because of what they have, family, you know, whatever.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.720]   And it reminds them, their mind is that.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.560]   - That's pretty profound.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.760]   - Yeah, and then, I don't remember,
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   because he didn't use the word suicide,
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.160]   but I got it.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.280]   Like, he basically, I forget how he said it,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.200]   but, like, I just got it.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.880]   I don't know how he got, I don't know.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.920]   But I just got it, like, so they don't hurt themselves.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.480]   That's what came across. - In every way.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.920]   - I don't think he ever articulated that,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.240]   or ever verbalized that,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.600]   but yeah, they don't hurt themselves.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.800]   And, well, how does that work?
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.760]   Well, just basically, they're gonna be around people
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.840]   that are gonna be alone.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.400]   They're gonna be around people that are gonna get fed.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.080]   They're gonna be warm, right?
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.920]   And it's gonna be for three days, two, three days, whatever.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.980]   And basically, it's a bridge.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.200]   So, the funny thing is, the 10-year-old,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.440]   I wanted to, I want to be connected to him.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.640]   So, I enlisted myself in the job
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.600]   when he used to drop them off.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.200]   He would take them, get them in, right?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.000]   And then, the thing that I know, again,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.160]   he didn't say nothing, but you notice things.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.080]   And if you care enough.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.560]   You don't notice nothing if you don't care.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.440]   But if you care, if it's important, you notice.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.000]   And this guy was important to me.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.360]   I just was, I didn't know what a hero was, no clue.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.200]   I loved Mickey Mantle, I loved Willie Mays,
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.880]   I loved Muhammad Ali.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.660]   I never, ever connected in my mind as heroes, never.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:21.260]   My father, I didn't connect it that way, but he--
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.100]   - Looking back now--
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.240]   - Looking back, he was my first connection to a hero.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.720]   - Did the two of you ever talk about
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.920]   how much you love each other?
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.240]   - The one thing that was not allowed.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.600]   The greatest memory I have my father showing me love
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   was, we were down in Florida at an airport,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.480]   and we were, I was born in Miami,
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.160]   don't ask if I was passing through,
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.840]   and the rest of my family's born in New York, stand out.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.600]   And so, I was supposed to go back home, right?
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.720]   And I wanted to stay with my mother for whatever reason.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   And so, he, of course, conceded to it.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.040]   And he's, okay, you know, whatever.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.280]   And very quiet, very, and this is a man
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.840]   who never showed emotion to anyone.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.560]   I mean, for the most, you know, really.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.960]   All of a sudden, he just turned
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.320]   and kissed me on the forehead and left.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.880]   And I was like, that's different.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.120]   - Yeah, you still remember that, huh?
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.120]   - Yeah, like, that's weird.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.520]   - You lost him 30 years ago.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.840]   How did that change you?
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:41.400]   - It made me realize that some of the deals
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.800]   I used to make for God weren't realistic.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.880]   When I was a kid, I used to make deals for God,
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.680]   let me die before my father.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:58.080]   And then, you know, you get older, you have kids,
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.440]   you're blessed, why did you make that deal?
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.840]   You know what I mean, like.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.320]   Thank you for not taking me up on it.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.000]   - Thanks.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.840]   - Yeah.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.960]   - You know?
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.760]   - Yeah, you miss him?
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.080]   - I miss him in moments when I'd like to know what to do.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.560]   And, you know, I remember when I would drive
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   with him on the house calls, he didn't listen to music.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.520]   He was a guy, he read books to his, when he got older,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   he read books till blood vessels broke in his eyes.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.440]   He only read non-fiction books.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   Science, he loved science, wars, generals.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.560]   I mean, I cheated on a couple book reports
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.160]   because I didn't do the reading of the book
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.200]   the night before, I had a freaking book report
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.280]   to put in that.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.920]   I got a book report to do on the War of Stalingrad.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.680]   Really, the War of Stalingrad.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.200]   And who the freak could tell you where you get an A?
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.040]   I got an A.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.120]   - Yeah.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.080]   - I just wrote what he told me.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.840]   Told me generals, he told me times, he told me strategy,
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.680]   he told me about the winter that came
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.880]   and destroyed the Germans.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.720]   - Yeah.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.920]   - And the Soviets were tougher than--
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.760]   - You got an A.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.360]   - And the Soviets were tougher than the Germans
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.400]   and you know, the Germans picked on the wrong opponent.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.240]   - Yeah.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.280]   - I was already in the boxing business.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.120]   - Yeah.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.960]   - I didn't even know it.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.780]   - Yeah.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.620]   - I didn't even know it.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.460]   - Yeah.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.280]   - Matchmaking, very important.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.120]   - Yeah.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.360]   - They mismatched.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.520]   They made a mistake with picking the opponent.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.280]   And so when we would be driving in the car,
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.440]   my father would be in a trance.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.640]   And dad, he wasn't ignoring me at all.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.160]   He was just with his thoughts.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.400]   He was wherever.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   He wasn't even hearing the radio no more.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.040]   I always wondered where he was.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.880]   I did.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.520]   So I asked him one day.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.160]   And just so we're driving, I said, I wanna know.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.600]   So I said, dad, what do you think
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.240]   when you're basically in this place
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.560]   that I know you're somewhere?
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.400]   - Yeah.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.360]   - What do you, where are you?
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.800]   What do you see?
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.400]   I actually said, what do you see?
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.060]   And he said to me, I see what could be.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.000]   I see what could be.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.160]   And I'm like, oh, all right.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   - I gotta ask you, when did you discover boxing?
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.160]   When did you first fall in love with boxing?
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.280]   - When it saved me.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.080]   - How did it save you?
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.760]   - I was a stupid, violent kid that was angry.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.440]   Not exactly know why I was angry.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.360]   I'd fit in real good in today's society
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.040]   because there's a lot of angry kids out there
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.560]   that I don't think they know why they're angry.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.240]   I was just out there getting in fights.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.480]   And I got this stupid thing from that.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.680]   - Can you tell the story of how you got that?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.200]   - I was just running around doing stupid things, bad things.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.040]   I hurt people, some people physically,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.320]   but I hurt my family.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.200]   You know, that's BS.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.520]   You only hurt yourself.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.240]   You know, that's a good way of, you know, alibi-ing it.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:32.840]   But at some point, the truth usually finds its way.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.720]   I'd like it to look like I was just hurting myself,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.560]   but I wasn't, obviously.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.000]   So I was just out on the streets
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.360]   with kids that didn't grow up in the neighborhood I grew up.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.160]   I grew up in a neighborhood where a father was a doctor.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.880]   And I walked down the street.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.640]   The funny thing was down the hill
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.160]   was a very tough neighborhood called Stapleton.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.120]   And most of the people down there on the corners
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.720]   wished they could get up the hill.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.280]   And I wished I could get down the hill.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.200]   So I went down the hill.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.920]   And I hung out with all these friends
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.520]   that became lifelong friends.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   And I gravitated to that
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.000]   because I figured out later a little bit,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.960]   but, you know, I wanted family.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.760]   We were a disjointed family.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.440]   We were, you know, my father was a doctor.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.160]   He didn't have time for nothing but being a doctor.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.480]   You know, I think when you're great at something,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.680]   you sacrifice something, too.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.720]   You know, when you're really great at something.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.960]   So great that maybe God made you great
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.480]   and you're too great for your own good.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.920]   And I don't know, it took me to these stupid,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.600]   dangerous places.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.480]   Dangerous for me, but dangerous for other people, too,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.840]   because I got to the point where I was doing robberies
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.520]   on the street, I was fighting everybody.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.720]   And you know what the most dangerous part about it was?
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.040]   And I came to this realization on my own, all by myself.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.640]   I figured out, I was really as dangerous,
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.000]   you know, these kids from the projects,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.160]   some of them, they got nothing.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.760]   First of all, I learned you don't have to be poor
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.680]   to be poor.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.000]   You don't have to be deprived of certain things
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.120]   to be deprived.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.800]   Because you, at least to think you're deprived.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.560]   And I was poor in a way that I didn't have
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.360]   the only thing I wanted to have, him.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   So here I am where I'm out there doing these things
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.120]   and what made me more, I was more dangerous
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.120]   than some of these psychopaths.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.600]   Well, I was a psychopath, too, I guess,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.720]   the way I was behaving.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.300]   But some of these psychopaths, they really had nothing.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.240]   You know, really would, you know,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.520]   they obviously would kill you.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.800]   I was dangerous almost in the same way,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.640]   but for a different reason.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.520]   I know it's ridiculous what I'm about to tell you,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.480]   but I figured it out, 'cause I felt it.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.440]   I thought I was on a righteous path.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.740]   I thought I had a right.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.440]   Because it was gonna get me my father back.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.160]   Why, why?
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.240]   I mean, you know, you're a scientist,
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.720]   you couldn't figure this one out.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.920]   Because all the people that had him
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.600]   were injured people, fractured people,
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.720]   screwed up people in some ways,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.280]   but hurt, damaged people.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.040]   So if I get damaged, I get 'em.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.080]   So I was on a crusade, really, a righteous crusade,
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.920]   where I thought it was okay.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.800]   I had permission.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   I had permission to do these terrible things, quite frankly,
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.840]   and to fight everyone, and to, I did.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.360]   And then it came almost to a crash,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.200]   doing all that, you know,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.600]   winding up in Rikers Island like an idiot.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.360]   Not understanding the damage I did to this poor man
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.640]   that, you know, he was a great doctor,
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.800]   and he's gotta see his son and hear about,
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.640]   you know what I mean?
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.520]   Like, God.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.560]   I was out on that day, you know,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.280]   with the guys that I grew up with now, you know,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.240]   the guys from the projects, as I described,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.600]   and I was with one of 'em who, he's dead now.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.000]   So I was with him, and we were,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.060]   we were in a neighborhood, the neighborhood we grew up,
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.000]   that I hung out in, and he grew up in, Billy.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.200]   He came from the project.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.720]   And we got into a thing where we cut,
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.220]   somebody cut us off, we cut them off, you know,
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.300]   jumped out to fight.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.360]   And, you know, it turned out there's like
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.080]   five or six of them, and two of us.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.840]   And, you know, we fought, you know,
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.800]   right on the side, right there.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.120]   Only about a block from where I used to hang out.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.280]   And maybe a block and a half.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.200]   And right in front of like a Spanish bodega.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.520]   And it really does happen in slow motion.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.880]   I actually saw the guys, fighting the guys
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.080]   that I had to fight, and then all of a sudden,
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.000]   I was able to get one guy out of the way a little bit.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.800]   And I really, I noticed the guy go into his pocket.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.660]   And I knew why he was going in his pocket, you know?
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.160]   And when he came out of his pocket,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.280]   I knew what it was right away.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.600]   It was weird, because in the neighborhood,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.260]   guys used to hang out, they were into this,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.080]   you know, they get into fads, like, right on the streets.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.640]   And they were into, at that time,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.040]   they were into this cheap knife,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.440]   but it was, they thought it was,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.200]   well, we thought it was cool.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.720]   It was a 007.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   And the cool thing, whatever, was that you could flick it.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.780]   You could learn, and I learned how to flick, you know?
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.120]   But I never carried a knife.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.920]   But when my friends would have it,
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.600]   I would just, you learn how you could flick it open.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   Not a switchblade, but flick it with your wrist.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.240]   And I was like, here I am in the middle
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.880]   of this frickin' fight, and all of a sudden,
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.640]   oh, it's a 007, you know?
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   And so, I'm like, you gotta make a decision, you know?
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:26.120]   And I got a split, I can either not do nothin',
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.080]   which didn't seem like a great, you know, a great option.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.740]   I couldn't run away.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.580]   - Why not?
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.660]   - 'Cause you gotta live with yourself afterwards,
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.500]   and that's more difficult to live with
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.980]   than whatever it is at that second,
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.140]   because that don't go away.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.340]   - You couldn't live with yourself running away.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.820]   - It just don't go away.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.060]   That thing, none to do with being brave.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.740]   It had nothing to do with being brave, really.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.920]   It's got to do with just common sense in life,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.920]   that for me, whatever you're dealing with, it's done.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.700]   Like, okay, deal with it, go to bed, whatever.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.620]   But you do that, you know, that other thing, you're gone.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:19.820]   That never ends, this thing ends.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.580]   - Memory of you being, let's say, a coward in that moment,
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.740]   that never ends.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.620]   - The only thing I had at that point in my life,
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.140]   in my stupid mind, was a reputation,
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.060]   that I would stand up to certain things.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.060]   That was like, and that, for me, was worth something,
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.380]   whatever, because I didn't feel any worth to anything else.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.460]   That was the only thing I felt a connection of worth to, so.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.300]   - So stood your ground, and you got caught.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.820]   - No, I made a decision.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.700]   I stood my ground, but I actually, things do slow down.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.540]   They do.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.820]   And I actually said, it's a double seven,
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.060]   he's got to flick it, you know, I didn't say it.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.820]   But he's got to flick it, I get a split second,
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.540]   either, like I said, either I do nothing, whatever,
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.380]   or I get to him before he gets it flicked.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.780]   I went to get to him before he got flicked.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.780]   And just as I got close to him, I did him a favor.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.180]   I walked right into a counterpunch.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:24.380]   Because I cooperated with him.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.500]   I went right to him.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   And just as I, he practiced more than I did
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.980]   with the double seven, apparently.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.900]   Because he was like, womp, womp, womp, womp.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.580]   And anyway.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.540]   - What did you think?
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.300]   What did you think that happened?
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.020]   That was all slow motion.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.380]   Did you think he might die?
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.740]   - Yeah, well, not immediately.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.100]   Took me a minute.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.180]   I'm a slow learner.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.820]   I'd put my hand up.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.660]   Right, wouldn't you?
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.740]   I guess so.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.500]   And it went into my face.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.580]   And that was it.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.700]   It was gooey.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.140]   It was warm and gooey.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.060]   And I was like, I don't know what this means,
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.380]   but I don't want to know.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.380]   But I think I know.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.100]   - Did you think about your dad in that moment?
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.300]   - No, you know, what I thought about him was,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.780]   you don't know who anyone is until they test it.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.260]   And I learned that.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.620]   Cush used to tell me, but I learned it.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.140]   He used to say, I remember one time Cush,
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.500]   I was a 17, 18 year old kid up there,
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.460]   and thought I was whatever I thought I was.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.740]   And he said, "You got a lot of friends?"
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.820]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.100]   Because I was on the street,
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.660]   hanging out with a hundred kids at night sometimes
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.500]   on the street corners.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.140]   So I was like, I don't know,
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.940]   too many people that hung out with a hundred kids
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.060]   on the street, on a corner, on a Friday, Saturday night.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.260]   And I was like, "Yeah, I got a lot of friends."
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.100]   He goes, "Really?"
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.380]   I said, "Yeah, really."
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.380]   He said, "How about if I told you, you might not have any?
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.380]   "Most likely you don't have any."
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:20.700]   And he goes, and then he just started this thing.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.460]   He said, "Everyone's got to be tested.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.080]   "You, me, everyone.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.860]   "'Cause you don't know about nobody 'til they're tested."
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.100]   He goes, "You know nothing.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.520]   "Because you know nothing until you know.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.460]   "Until something happens to test
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.020]   "if they were really a friend."
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.340]   And then he told me this story about a guy.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.900]   A guy came to him and he was upset.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.300]   "What are you upset about?"
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   He goes, "I'm upset because I just lost a friend.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:56.060]   "After 20 years of friendship, we're not friends no more."
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.500]   So he goes, "Let me ask you a question.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.220]   "What made you think you ever friends with him?"
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.420]   Now the guy gets insulted.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.380]   He goes, "Did you hear me?"
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.940]   He goes, "I just told you 20 years
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.840]   "I've been friends with this guy.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.900]   "Why would you say that to me?"
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.940]   He said, "Well, I'll say it again.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.140]   "What makes you think he was your friend?"
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.260]   He goes, "Whatever happened in the 20 years
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   "other than chasing girls."
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.240]   This guy figured that one out fast.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.140]   "Chasing girls and drinking together
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.040]   "and whatever else you're doing out on the street.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   "Whatever gave you the inclination that he was a friend?"
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.540]   He goes, "Whatever, when did he risk himself
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.760]   "to be your friend?
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.700]   "When was it dangerous to be your friend?"
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.900]   - When was the friendship tested?
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.620]   - "When was it uncomfortable to be your friend?"
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.740]   And you know what the guy said?
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.500]   You can figure it out, you're a scientist.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.500]   He said, "Today."
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:03.540]   And today came for me.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.500]   And today, today, today, today kept coming for me.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.260]   Today, and that day my friend, Billy,
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.100]   had turned out while I was fighting these whatever,
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.700]   five, six guys.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.140]   And where was Billy?
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:23.140]   He was on a roof, he was on a roof, he was on a roof.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.300]   He was my best friend.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:31.300]   And so anyway, they take me to the hospital.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.660]   And here's the thing with my father.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.380]   But one thing Billy did do for me
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.100]   when he got off the roof, thank God,
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.380]   he did, he dragged me into this bodega,
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.760]   laid me on the floor, and started putting towels.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.900]   And the towels, I vaguely remember this,
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.980]   they filled up with blood.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.060]   I mean, completely drenched,
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.860]   like you put 'em under a shower.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:03.100]   And I heard the bodega owner screaming,
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.500]   screaming, you know, like, "What?"
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.220]   You know, whatever.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.860]   And everyone's screaming and there's chaos.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.420]   And I'm like, I don't know, I'm calm, weird.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.780]   I'm like, real calm.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:21.740]   And I'm just in this place,
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.240]   everything's calm.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.060]   And all of a sudden, I hear Billy,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.780]   he's screaming, "Call the ambulance, call the ambulance."
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.740]   You know, and nobody's doing nothing, everyone's frozen.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.980]   I'm starting to understand already,
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.940]   people get frozen in situations.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.720]   People, the fear, fear, fear, fear, fear,
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.620]   just paralyzes people.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.900]   And I was going into a fear business.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.500]   I was learning, I was learning,
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.380]   I was getting a learning, an early PhD.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.220]   - A student in fear.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.940]   - Yeah, and all of a sudden, genius,
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.740]   Billy, genius, really, street kid.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.940]   He jumps up on a freaking counter,
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.820]   jumps over the counter, grabs the phone,
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.300]   calls 911, says a cop's been shot.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.540]   And forget about it, it was crazy.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.860]   All I remember after that,
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.220]   I'll tell you a couple of things I remember.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.700]   Lights, being put onto a stretcher,
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.740]   bounced around, you know, rushed.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:33.500]   I felt everyone's anxiety, except mine, I had none.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.480]   But I felt everyone's anxiety, everyone's fear.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.820]   Like, it was all around me, it was like,
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.740]   oh, this is interesting, this is kind of interesting.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.340]   I know that's stupid, but like, well, this is interesting.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.860]   - You really have an eye for fear, that's fascinating.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.660]   You're really studying it.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.420]   - Well, I had no choice, I got introduced in a crash course,
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.120]   and they put me in the ambulance,
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.940]   and this is what I remember, to your point.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.900]   I'm sorry it took so long to get to it.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.020]   I am, although I'll probably do it again
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.220]   before this conversation's over.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.880]   But I-- - It's all about the journey.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.720]   - Yeah, we'll get there, we'll get there, pops.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.420]   So I hear the cops say, "We might lose him."
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.380]   And I'm like, laughing to myself.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.820]   I'm not laughing because I'm not, again, I'm not John Wayne.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.340]   John Wayne would've laughed.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.460]   But I'm like, hey, lose?
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.080]   You guys are stupid, you know, I didn't say that.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.180]   But I'm like, lose me?
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.100]   My father's the greatest doctor in the freaking world.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.660]   There's nothing to worry about.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.660]   You people are all uptight and whacked out here with fear,
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:46.520]   and there's nothing to worry about.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.180]   Dr. Atlas is my father.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.620]   So anyway, so they're taking me to the,
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.240]   and they say, "We don't have time."
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.600]   I hear, a couple things I remember, don't have time.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.760]   Take 'em to, and they take me to US Public Health Hospital.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.000]   Marina Hospital it was called at the time,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.680]   but US Public Health.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.780]   And it's in Stapleton, so it's close, thank God.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.520]   So they're taking me, and I hear them on the radio,
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.780]   you know, saying this stuff about we gotta move,
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.000]   we gotta move.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And I start talking, and they're telling me don't talk.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.120]   But I like to talk a lot, you know?
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.200]   And I'm, so again, fear.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.020]   There's no fear when the fear's been removed.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:37.720]   It's the only time you're really free in life.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.520]   And I know that sounds absurd, but really, it is.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.840]   It's the only time you're really free in life.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.360]   I was, when you-- - Close to death?
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.360]   - When you're devoid of things that normally hold you back,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.640]   that normally influence you in ways that, you know,
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.080]   that are not of the influence,
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   that are always positive influence,
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.720]   where you're in a pure place,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.800]   where you're in a purely free place from all inhibitions,
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.640]   from fear, from anxiety, from joy.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.840]   Joy can screw you up.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.580]   And you're free from all these things.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.640]   And I'm in this place.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.800]   - In the back of an ambulance, you're free.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.720]   - Yeah, I'm like, I said, just get me Dr. Atlas.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.920]   And they say, we don't have time.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.760]   No, no, no, no, no, you don't.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.240]   You have to get Dr. Atlas.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   You have to get him.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.000]   This was the, damn it, this was the,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.820]   you know what I mean?
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.160]   I finally freaking hit the number,
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.640]   and I'm not getting paid.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.640]   And then all of a sudden, I'm out.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.880]   - How many stitches did you take?
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.320]   - Well, I think it was 400, 200 inside, 200 outside,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.160]   or whatever it was.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.980]   - That's a lot.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.980]   - Look, after 50, that number doesn't matter no more, right?
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.720]   Or whatever, 60, 70, 80, 90, whatever.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.320]   You know, so I was fortunate.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   I was fortunate.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.040]   And of course, I was fortunate.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.960]   They told me afterwards that I missed my jugular
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.400]   literally by like a centimeter.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.120]   I mean, whatever.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.680]   And so then we wouldn't be having
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.600]   this conversation, obviously.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.560]   - Well, I'm glad you made it.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.400]   - Yeah.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.220]   - That's another thing.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.060]   - I'm kind of glad, too.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.360]   And it just missed my eye, which, thank God.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.440]   It's bad enough I have a scar.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.000]   Imagine me with a patch.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.400]   I mean, it's enough that I got this freaking thing.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.480]   And look, it goes all the way.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.360]   It's pretty long.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   And I don't know, I was out.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.880]   And then somehow, I sensed like they had the curtain closed.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.700]   And it's amazing how vivid this is.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.700]   And the curtain's closed and I see a shadow.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.420]   I felt a presence.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.420]   I did.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.780]   And I felt him.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.300]   He's a powerful guy.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.060]   And I felt him.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.380]   And I just see like a shadow, you know?
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.940]   And all of a sudden, the curtain gets pushed back.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.100]   And I can't really see.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.960]   It's dark and I'm, you know, out of it.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.960]   But not completely out of it.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.380]   And pushes the curtain back, comes in.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.220]   And his hand, even though it's all bandage, you know,
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.420]   whatever, but his hand surveys.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:29.020]   It felt safe.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.940]   And it felt warm and safe.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.940]   I was happy.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.820]   And he got there, you know?
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.780]   - Did he say something?
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.240]   Remember, I gave you a little bit of introduction
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.080]   to my father, right?
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.260]   You know him now a little bit, right?
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.180]   What'd he say about the job?
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.460]   - He just said, this is what he said.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.800]   I remember to this day what he said.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.640]   - Yeah.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.460]   - That I do remember.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.080]   I don't know if it was six or five people,
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.620]   but this I do remember.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.740]   - Yeah.
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.500]   - He said, "They did a good job.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.580]   "You're gonna have a scar the rest of your life."
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.420]   And he left.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:07.260]   - Oh, man.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.500]   They did a good job.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.180]   - "You mentioned Kostamato, legendary trainer.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.660]   "And you also mentioned it turned out
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.480]   "he really cared about you.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.500]   "In the book you write about a testimony he gave."
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.380]   I was hoping I could read it,
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.940]   'cause it speaks to your character, it speaks to his.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.540]   It's just powerful.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.360]   The testimony goes, "Your Honor,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.220]   "I realize you might not know much about me,
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.780]   "but I spent my whole life developing young men.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.340]   "As a boxing manager, I trained two world champions,
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.180]   "heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson,
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.120]   "and light heavyweight champion Jose Torres.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.020]   "I've also helped a lot of other young boys
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.620]   "straighten out their lives and build character.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.420]   "I know things about Teddy Atlas this court doesn't know,
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.720]   "things you won't find on his arrest record.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.160]   "This boy has character, he has loyalty.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.240]   "He'll hurt himself before he'll let down a friend.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   "These qualities are rare, and they shouldn't be lost.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.440]   "He's made mistakes, we've all made mistakes,
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.120]   "but I've come to know this boy,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.800]   "and if we lose him, we'll be losing someone
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.120]   "who could help a lot of people.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.380]   "Please don't take this young boy's future away.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.340]   "He could be someone special.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.000]   "Let's not lose him, please."
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.240]   Those are powerful words from a powerful man.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.060]   What have you learned about life from Mr. Customato?
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:43.720]   - He gave me a quote, and he drilled into my head.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.480]   I became his guy, you know?
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.820]   He loved me, I loved him.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:55.040]   He said to me, "Teddy, no matter what a man says,
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.460]   "it's what he does in the end
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.560]   "that he intended to do all along."
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.500]   That's what I learned from Cust.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.160]   The rest of it is BS.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:17.940]   A lot of people say things.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.820]   You just have to give 'em a minute
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.440]   to let them show you, eventually,
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.860]   what they really meant by it.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.660]   I also learned from him that
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:37.700]   everyone's afraid.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.140]   Cust is a way of saying, another great saying,
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.260]   you'll get a kick out of this.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.860]   Anyone who's in a situation where fear should be prevalent,
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.900]   where fear is actually necessary to survive the situation,
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.120]   anyone who says that they're not afraid,
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.920]   they're one of two things.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.460]   They're either a liar, or they should go to a doctor,
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.500]   find out what the frick's wrong with 'em.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.260]   He was right about that.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:09.660]   We live in a taboo society where that word,
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.100]   to a certain extent, is taboo,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.800]   because it invokes weakness.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.020]   We are just layers of what we saw and learned
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.980]   since we were kids.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.340]   We all are.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.460]   We're products of those layers.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.860]   I learned that on my own, through some help.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.240]   At the end of the day,
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:44.580]   fear, people will find their way of avoiding that term,
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.520]   so they use the word anxiety.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.500]   They use the word, you know, butterflies.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:58.560]   Apprehension, you know, a million different words.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.920]   I find all those other words to be cousins of fear.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.920]   And fear causes a lot of things in life.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.060]   It causes a lot of problems,
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.040]   and it also solves a lot of problems.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.520]   Without it, we couldn't be great.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.840]   If we are great, if we ever have a chance
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.600]   to be great, or at least to aspire to be great.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.680]   - How does fear connect to greatness?
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.520]   That's a profound statement.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.460]   Without fear, we wouldn't be able to be great.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.640]   - Yeah, you couldn't be great without fear,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   because fear allows you to be brave.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.400]   The most important word for me
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.200]   in this whole conversation, right,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.660]   in this whole neighborhood, would be selfishness.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.700]   It allows you to be, for a moment, less selfish.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.320]   One of the things I learned, I guess,
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.240]   partly on my own, everyone thinks
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.680]   my greatest teacher was Cuss.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.760]   He was a great teacher, mentor.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.160]   My greatest teacher was my father,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.400]   the one who never taught.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   And I realized, one of the things to be better,
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   towards great, is if you can submit less than we submit.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.680]   See, one of the things that I'm afraid of,
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.520]   one of the things I was always quitting,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.820]   in my business, it's kind of not a good thing.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.640]   - Every business, I think.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.320]   Yours is just more clear.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.320]   - Yeah, it hurts more.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.500]   - True, in the moment, at least.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.820]   - Yeah, in the moment.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.340]   You're right, 100%, because some things hurt
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.260]   for a long time afterwards.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.820]   And something like regret.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.140]   Regret is the worst thing in the world,
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.240]   because it's a solitary sentence.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.360]   - That's a powerful phrase.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.020]   Regret is a solitary sentence.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.960]   Oh boy, you're full of good lines.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.020]   - It wasn't easy to accumulate them.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:17.000]   It was a little bit hurtful.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.620]   Submit less, because we submit every day.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.660]   And if we can get to a place where we submiss
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.500]   or compromise ourselves less,
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.320]   we'll get to a better place.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.660]   Again, one of the words for me
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.660]   that attaches to things that wind up hurting you in life,
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.620]   and have hurt me in life,
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:47.980]   one of those boogeymen words is the word of convenience.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.780]   That's attached to everything.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.140]   People disappoint you not because
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.780]   they want to disappoint you,
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.480]   or let you down, or betray you,
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.380]   because they want to betray you.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.820]   They do it because it's more convenient to do
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.180]   than the other thing.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.320]   An old man once told me, he said to me,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.860]   I was trying to rationalize something.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.700]   I was trying to make some excuse for something.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.380]   I was trying to make myself better than I was.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.880]   I was trying to say it was okay.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.740]   And he just looked at me, and he liked me.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:29.720]   And he said, "Teddy, there ain't no such thing
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.180]   "as being a little pregnant."
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.540]   I was like, yeah.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.860]   'Cause either you're pregnant or you're not pregnant.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.300]   Either you're real or you're not real.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.180]   Either you're truthful or you're not truthful.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.540]   Either you're tough or you're not tough.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.540]   Either you're committed or you're not committed.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.100]   Either you're in or you're out.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.700]   - That applies to a lot of things.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.220]   - Yeah. - Including loyalty.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.900]   - That's quite a statement.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.700]   But the lifeblood of humanity, for me, is loyalty.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.460]   It's what goes through the veins of,
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.140]   everything has to have some veins in some form.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.380]   And if humanity has veins,
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.800]   what runs through the veins of humanity
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.200]   instead of blood to keep it alive is loyalty.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.380]   Without loyalty-- - Those are powerful words.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.100]   - Without loyalty, we're dead.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.820]   We're freaking, we're vessels.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.220]   I never understood what a ghost ship was.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.300]   You know what, as I got older,
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.620]   I know what a ghost ship is, it's people.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.660]   It's people that are empty.
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.780]   They got no loyalty.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.780]   Therefore, they got no humanity.
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.180]   Therefore, they got nothing.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.220]   Therefore, freak them, freak them.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.700]   Because, and you know why they don't have loyalty?
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.740]   Convenience, and you know why?
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:52.940]   Because it takes, it's hard to be loyal.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.100]   It's actually hard.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.540]   I'll be a son of a gun.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.580]   Yeah, you're talking about, yeah, it sounds great.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.900]   Give it to me, give it to me, paint me with it.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.060]   Yeah, it's great, yeah, I'm loyal.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.540]   Yeah, I'm great, yeah, this is good, I'm ready.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.420]   I'm on that team, I'm ready, put me in, coach, I'm ready.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:14.340]   Okay, now you have to, you're gonna have to get hurt here.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.420]   What do you mean, get hurt?
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.260]   Oh, well, it's gonna be painful.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.380]   I mean, to be loyal, you're gonna be in danger
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.140]   because the person that you committed your loyalty to
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.980]   for a reason, because obviously,
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.480]   you did something in your life, whatever, whatever.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.940]   You're actually gonna get hurt to be loyal to 'em.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.140]   You're actually gonna, hold on a minute, wait,
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.340]   hold on a minute, coach.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.920]   Hold on, call time out here.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.220]   Let me think about this, coach.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.220]   I might need more practice.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.740]   I'm not ready for the game.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.540]   I'm not ready to go in the game yet.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.260]   Give me a little more practice, coach.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.660]   And it hurts to be loyal, it frickin' hurts.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.660]   But without loyalty, we're ghost ships.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.780]   We got no strength.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.380]   We got nothing.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.700]   We got nothing, we got nothing.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.340]   - I agree with you in a deep, fundamental sense,
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.820]   but there's pain that comes with that.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:17.820]   I have to ask you to introspect on this part of your life
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.800]   because of your value for loyalty.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:26.020]   As people know, you and Acosta Motto,
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.860]   trained young Mike Tyson.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.860]   And the interaction there between the three of you
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.120]   led to the three of you parting ways.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:42.100]   Given your value for loyalty, can you tell the full story
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:47.100]   of what led up to this and maybe the pain you felt
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:51.140]   from that?
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.300]   (silence)
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:45:02.100]   - I guess it was the second time in my life I felt betrayed.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:08.940]   The first time was when I was whatever, young, 17.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.060]   And I got arrested.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.860]   I was with all these older guys, tough guys, whatever.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:24.940]   And supposedly, and the detectives separated us,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.260]   that's what they do.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:32.260]   And they asked me who did whatever, whose gun,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.380]   this, that, all that, the particulars
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.180]   of obviously what we did.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.900]   And it was me.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.000]   And they said, "You sure?
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.880]   "You don't want to change that?
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.220]   "Because your friends changed it."
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.480]   And these cops, they were nasty,
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.320]   but they were cops.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.460]   They were the way, you know, you're gonna wind up
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.540]   with Rikers and they're gonna be doing this to you.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.740]   And I won't even say the things
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.720]   because then why say them, you know?
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.820]   Figure it out.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.740]   But you know, they're trying to get what they're trying
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.060]   to get and you know, you want to change it?
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.580]   And no.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:13.020]   But I felt very betrayed, you know?
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.100]   And especially when I was standing in the cell
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.000]   at Rikers looking at the airplanes leave LaGuardia Airport
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.120]   and then hoping I was on one.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.880]   You know, I was making like a deal with God
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.960]   that let me be on one of those planes and let it crash.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.560]   I'd take a shot.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.600]   - Was part of you proud
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.380]   that you didn't give up your friends?
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.000]   - No, because I didn't understand what proud was.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.040]   I didn't understand nothing.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.840]   I just understood that--
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.640]   - Rules are rules, you're just loyal and that's it.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.080]   - I didn't even know there was an option.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.740]   I didn't think, I know the cops said you could do this
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.660]   but there was no option.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.580]   My father never had an option
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:59.500]   but the betrayal, the private betrayal was like
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   and so when Cuz, we were partners, me and Cuz.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.200]   Cuz was retired.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.540]   This stupid kid goes up there
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.540]   and all of a sudden I start training fighters.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.500]   First I won the gloves, Cuz put me in the gloves,
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.380]   I won the gloves, then I had an injury, whatever
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.700]   but bottom line is I still want to fight.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.220]   I want to turn pro, I want to fight.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:25.920]   That was the plan and Cuz had a different plan.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:31.060]   Cuz was like, and he had it set up a little bit,
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.940]   whatever, without getting into it.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.020]   Hey, he did me a favor
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.220]   and I'd like to think he knew he was doing me a favor
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.040]   and you know what?
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.380]   I do think he was.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.380]   He was doing himself a little bit of one too
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.500]   but he was doing it for the greater cause
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.760]   because he believed in this thing of boxing.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.940]   He believed that it changed lives.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.900]   He believed that it was worthwhile.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.300]   He believed that there was a power to it
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.820]   beyond the left hook.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.980]   - The big picture of boxing.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.800]   - Yeah.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.640]   - He believed in it.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.140]   - Yeah, he believed that to be a champion,
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.900]   you had to be special, you had to be smart,
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.860]   you had to have character,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.900]   that you had to be a better person
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.580]   and that you couldn't make a champion
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.540]   if you didn't make him a better person first
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:15.300]   and that this could strengthen people,
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.460]   the sport could strengthen people in those ways.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.180]   So he was married to it
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:25.140]   and he was old and he needed,
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.580]   there was no one in the gym, it was empty
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.940]   and it was above a police station, which was crazy
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.060]   and he needed an heir to the throne.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.660]   He needed to pass it on to someone
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.980]   and he saw something and all of a sudden
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.060]   he saw that my career as a boxer was less important
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.780]   than having me become his heir to the throne
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.220]   and become his trainer, his man, his guy
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:53.740]   to continue that we could do a lot more for him
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:57.540]   and for everyone, not just for him, but for everyone.
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.060]   It was more like to keep it going.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.340]   Like it couldn't die, it couldn't die
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.780]   and the cousin was afraid that it would die with him
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.180]   and he committed his whole life to it.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.900]   He didn't get married because of boxing.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   So he saw me as the little bit of the seed to plant
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:22.580]   for more things to grow before that plant died
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:26.700]   and so all of a sudden he said, "You can't fight."
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.980]   And I had people tell me
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.420]   that I could go somewhere else and fight
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:36.420]   and I could, but I couldn't because I'd be disloyal.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.860]   - Loyalties, everything.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.260]   - Yeah, so I couldn't leave 'cause and he kind of knew that
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.860]   and so I couldn't leave him and he said,
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.700]   "You have an ability to teach."
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.020]   He said, "Knowledge means nothing."
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.540]   He said, "See these Britannica?"
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.020]   He had Britannica encyclopedias,
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.940]   the whole set in our library.
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.300]   He said, "You see these?"
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.700]   Yeah, I see 'em.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.880]   "All the knowledge of the world," whatever,
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.060]   "is in these."
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.980]   All right.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.900]   "Means nothing if you don't have somebody
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.300]   "to convey it to people.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.980]   "Otherwise it just sits on a bookshelf and looks good."
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.620]   He goes, "You have the ability
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.060]   "to convey knowledge to people.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.220]   "You're a teacher.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.260]   "You were born to be a teacher.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.620]   "You'd lessen yourself by only being a champion fighter
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.940]   "because you'd only take care of one person.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.540]   "You could take care of all kinds of people
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.460]   "and you could do this and you could do that
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.380]   "and you could do this."
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.780]   So we go on this venture.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.900]   Took a minute 'cause I didn't believe him at first,
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.220]   but finally we, I am.
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.060]   I'm there.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.140]   I'm training fighters.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:44.100]   And then he gets me to buy in.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:49.340]   And I was a teacher and I start teaching these kids
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.340]   and there's no one in the gym, it's dead.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.860]   And all of a sudden there's 10 kids,
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.820]   15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.220]   Catskill Boxing Club, which was never there.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.420]   Now it's there.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.940]   And I'm training fighters.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.260]   I'm taking them down to South Bronx to get experience.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.460]   One of his former fighters, Nelson Cuevas,
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.540]   down to South Bronx.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.180]   I'm taking them down there to get smokers,
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.300]   to get fights when they're ready.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.460]   After I teach, I'm wearing out dungarees.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.740]   I'm getting holes in my dungarees.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.260]   I was fashionable before it was fashionable
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.980]   to have holes in my dungarees.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.900]   I could have made a lot of money with that
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:23.060]   because I was on my knees with these little kids,
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:26.180]   nine years old, 10 years old, eight years old,
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:30.020]   10, 12, 13, 14, 15, all these kids.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.500]   And I'm teaching them and I'm building a gym.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.380]   And Cuzz only came once a week
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.620]   because he was semi-retired, you know.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.980]   And when he would come once a week,
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.580]   he knew he couldn't give me money,
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.060]   but he gave me more than money.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.220]   He gave me praise.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.300]   And he said, "Look what Atlas is doing.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.660]   He's creating champions."
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:54.260]   And I was like, "Whoa, yeah, wow, I'm doing good."
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.940]   And then all of a sudden, after four years of that,
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.900]   because I was up there seven years, eight years,
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.500]   after about three and a half, four years of that,
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.260]   we get a phone call that they got this kid in prison
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.340]   in Tryon Prison from one of the guys that knew Cuzz,
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   Matt Baranski, and there's a correctional officer
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.180]   named Bobby Stewart, who used to box.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.900]   And Cuzz had helped him out a little bit,
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.220]   and they knew we had this gym now
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.580]   that was really starting to become something
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.100]   because we were winning tournaments and everything else.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.500]   They're going, "We got this kid, Mike Tyson.
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.780]   He's 12 years old, he's 190 pounds, and he's a mess."
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.420]   But Bobby Stewart got involved with him,
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.220]   you know, the former fighter,
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.220]   and he's taken a liking to it.
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.300]   And now where he didn't behave at all,
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.700]   and he didn't listen to anyone, now he's listening
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.060]   because Bobby's got a carrot,
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.140]   and the carrot is his teacher boxing.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.540]   And now he's at the point now
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.740]   where we want you to take a look, you and Teddy.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.060]   All right, bring him down.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.060]   What did you think when you first saw Mike Tyson?
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.980]   - Well, I wanted to see his birth certificate
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.740]   because he's 190 pounds, 12 years old, and all solid.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.340]   - Yeah.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.340]   - You know, really?
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.180]   But yeah.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.660]   - Just physically, just as a physical specimen.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:17.660]   - Yeah, and listen, Cuzz was right, I was a teacher.
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:23.060]   He was right, and he was testing me even that day.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:24.300]   He said, "What do you think?"
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.700]   So I said, "Well, we ain't gonna know nothing in the bag.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.860]   "Who the freak cares about that?"
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.820]   He knocked the bag down.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.540]   We gotta put him in, we got no one to put him in that way.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.140]   They didn't have anyone that way.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.900]   We gotta test him, everyone's gotta be tested.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.260]   And so you gotta put him in, responsibly.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.220]   But let's put him in, just responsibly.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.700]   But let's put him in with Bobby Stewart,
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.140]   former pro fighter, had 14 pro fights.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:51.340]   Smaller than Tyson, when he was fighting, he was 175.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.740]   But still, he's 28 years old, Tyson's 12, come on.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.700]   And he'll work with him, right?
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.100]   So we do, we put him in.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.420]   Tyson, he recognized the moment.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.540]   He understood this was an audition.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:08.540]   This was a chance, this was that TV show, Change Your Life.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:13.020]   And he understood that if he passed the audition,
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.940]   he could possibly change his life.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.140]   He wasn't sure what, how could he be sure what exactly,
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.260]   but it was better than what he had.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.580]   And so he was on audition, so he wanted,
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.780]   he innately understood what we would wanna see.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:32.780]   Ferociousness, toughness, character, desire,
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.660]   and of course, ability.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.700]   Well, we saw the ability, power, speed,
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:43.060]   but it was unbridled, it was untaught, it was raw.
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:47.340]   He didn't know really much at all, at all.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:50.140]   But we saw that.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.620]   But he wanted to show more.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:52.820]   He knew that wasn't enough.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:55.140]   Again, innate intelligence.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.500]   He had to show desire, he had to show toughness.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.300]   And so I was being responsible.
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.740]   After two rounds, that's enough.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.460]   Normally, I don't put a guy into boxing
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.420]   to maybe four months, five months, six months,
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.340]   eight months, 10 months.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.700]   It depends what it takes to learn on the floor
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.980]   before it's responsible to put him in the ring
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:17.980]   to actually take on incoming real live shells
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.260]   instead of blanks.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.980]   And so normally, I wouldn't have him in.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.260]   And I knew after today, he wouldn't be in the ring again
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.100]   if I trained him.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.140]   I would teach him first,
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.380]   and then he'd get back in in a few months.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.940]   But for this day, it was the only way...
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.660]   It's kind of like, I used to make this announcement,
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.580]   Cus loved it.
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.340]   He said, "What's training a fighter?
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.900]   "What do you look for in training a fighter, Teddy?"
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.820]   You know, he asked me this ridiculous question
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.100]   just to test me.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.300]   And I say, "It's like going to Macy's."
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.500]   Oh, he loved it.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.820]   I said, "It's like going to Macy's window at Christmas."
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.220]   He goes, "What do you mean, Macy's window?"
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.340]   You know, Cus was like, boom, boom, boom.
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.460]   So, "What do you mean, Macy's window?"
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.580]   "Oh, you go to Macy's window,
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.460]   "and they got the window with everything you wanna see,
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.700]   "everything in there, and it looks great, everything."
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.500]   And, "Yeah, and then what?"
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.420]   "Well, then you ask what's in the warehouse,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.820]   "and they tell you nothing."
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:15.780]   And Cus says, "That's it, that's a trainer."
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.100]   And I wanted to see what was in the warehouse,
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:21.060]   because I saw what was in Macy's window.
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.460]   I saw the power, I saw the speed.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:25.460]   So, he goes two rounds, and he gets a bloody nose.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:28.940]   Here's the weird thing, not weird, very telling.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.100]   We knew what we were doing.
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.780]   Not bragging, but we knew what we were doing,
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.860]   because he got a bloody nose because he got hit.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.100]   After that bloody nose,
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.700]   he never got another bloody nose.
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.500]   You know why he didn't get hit?
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.580]   Because he learned.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.540]   He was still strong, but he was smart enough.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:48.660]   Anyway, he goes two rounds, and I'm being responsible,
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.900]   because if he goes more, it's not responsible.
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.820]   I saw what I needed to see.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.900]   I saw speed, I saw power, I saw athleticism.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.900]   And I saw, I didn't believe him.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.260]   I thought he was lying to me, I'm just telling you.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.100]   I thought he was lying, trying to act tough
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.540]   when he wasn't really feeling tough.
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.740]   It didn't matter.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.260]   Cus questioned me on it afterwards.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.620]   "What did you see?"
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.900]   And when I said, he goes, "Young master!"
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.380]   You know, again, he wasn't paying me money.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.900]   So, he had to give me something, right?
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.580]   And that was better than, that was currency.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:17.420]   "Young master!"
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:19.020]   I'm the young master, whoa.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.100]   You know, "Young master!"
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.700]   Like, I felt like that guy, Kung Fu, you know?
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.220]   Like in the movie, like Kung Fu.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.420]   Grasshopper, when you're ready,
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.740]   when you can take this out of my hand, you can leave.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.940]   And-- - That's powerful.
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:31.340]   - Yeah, it was.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.700]   It worked.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.540]   Cus knew how to work me.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:36.900]   And he did, and it worked.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.980]   And so, but you know what?
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.020]   I didn't mind being worked.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.580]   I kind of knew I was being shuffled a little bit.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.500]   - Well, you're making it sound a little bit negative,
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.580]   but it's also extremely positive.
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:54.020]   That's a teacher instilling wisdom into you
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:56.700]   that you carried forward and impacted a lot of people.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.020]   - Yeah, Cus got the job done, but he did it his way.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.700]   And he did it for a lot of, a myriad of reasons.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:05.860]   But at the end of the day, it was all good.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:10.860]   And I just had to understand that eventually, later on.
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:12.020]   - And you do the same.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.980]   You do things your way and carry some of him in you,
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:15.980]   some of your father in you.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:19.940]   - Yeah, that day, you know, that day was funny
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.180]   because when Cus said, "What did you see, Teddy?"
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.260]   When him, after two rounds, I got up on the ring.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.820]   I knew I was gonna train him.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.180]   Obviously, we weren't gonna say no.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.900]   And he still had about four months to serve
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.300]   and we were gonna work it out.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.140]   - Yeah.
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:38.900]   - And when I got up on the ring apron,
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.740]   that's my job, I'm the boss.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.740]   You know, people later on in life called me a dictator.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:44.580]   You know what they said?
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.700]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:46.540]   I didn't deny it.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.900]   People thought, "You mean I'm right?"
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.100]   Yeah, I'm a dictator.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:50.940]   I'm a trainer.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.060]   I'm the boss.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.180]   I'm in charge.
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.260]   If I, you wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.420]   What the frick you need me for
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.340]   if I'm not frickin' in charge, you idiot?
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.260]   Yeah, yeah, damn right.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:04.260]   Well, what do you think, it's a shared responsibility?
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.860]   No, it's my responsibility.
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:06.980]   That's why you're here.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.180]   Yeah, I am in charge.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.740]   And you shouldn't be here if you don't understand that.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:15.020]   So I get up there and I know that I'm gonna be training 'em.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.940]   I gotta show 'em who the boss is.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.420]   You know, I'm being really frank about this.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.980]   So I get up there and I say, "That's it, out."
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.540]   No, no!
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.380]   You know, this is Tyson.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.260]   No, let me go, I wanna do another round.
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.580]   I wanna do another one, I wanna.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.620]   I said, "Out."
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.060]   Did you hear what I said?
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.260]   Because I knew that, you know, he was gonna test me.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.220]   He was testing me.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.540]   I said, "Get out."
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.620]   And then he got out.
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.820]   - But were you impressed with the fact
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.380]   that he wanted to keep going or not?
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.260]   - Yes, and I recognized what it really was.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.340]   So Cus asked me, "What was that?"
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.300]   Cus wanted to know what the young master saw.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.740]   So Cus said, "What was that?"
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:56.420]   I said, "It was an act."
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.260]   He goes, "You saw that?
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.820]   "Did he really wanna go?"
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.940]   I said, "No."
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.260]   I said, "He didn't really wanna go,
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.100]   "but he knew that we want him to go
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.900]   "and he made himself ready to go in order to satisfy,
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.340]   "and that's just as good."
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.820]   And Cus said, "Damn right, it's just as good."
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.820]   All that matters was not how he got there,
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.860]   but that he got there.
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.060]   That's all that matters, that he got there,
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.460]   that he got to the place to act like a fighter,
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.740]   to do what we want him to do, to be ready to persevere,
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.620]   to go beyond the comfort level, to do another round.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.340]   He didn't want to, damn right he didn't want to,
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.500]   but he knew we want him to,
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:43.220]   and he knew in order to pass the test, he had to do it.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.940]   And he said, "You're right."
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:49.780]   He goes, "Now it's gonna be your job to teach him,
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.020]   "to make him a fighter that don't get bloody noses,
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.320]   "that don't get hit, and will get to that place
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.100]   "without being coerced to get there,
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.040]   "to get to that place on his own,
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:07.440]   "instead of using the things that he had to use
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.460]   "to get to that place today.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.380]   "Those things are not going to be available one day."
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.620]   When you, and listen to this,
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.660]   you talk about a man being prophetic,
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.100]   'cause it's pretty good.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.380]   You talk about a man being on the job, on the money.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.540]   Lex, he says, "How do you think he finishes the sentence?"
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.360]   He goes, "Because someday, because you know,
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.960]   "you're gonna have to make sure that he learns these things,
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.860]   "because you know, he'll be your first heavyweight champ."
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.680]   What did you just say?
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.860]   He's 12 years old.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.780]   He's been arrested 30 times.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:46.420]   He's getting out of jail, out of juvenile detention,
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:51.420]   try on, he's a mess in a lot of ways.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.200]   There's a lot of things we find out later,
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.400]   a lot of problems, weaknesses.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.780]   He goes, "And that's part of your job.
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.560]   "That'll be part of your job."
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.840]   But he really said that.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.880]   And then he turned to him, he goes,
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.440]   "You want to come live with us, young man?
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.520]   "You want to be a fighter?"
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.760]   Yes, even that, 'cause he said to me later,
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.720]   "What do you think about that?"
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.320]   I said, "It ain't gonna be--"
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.320]   - The way he said yes.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.460]   - Yeah, the way he said yes.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.040]   "Yes, sir."
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.600]   He said, "What do you think about that?"
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.840]   And we're talking, I said,
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.320]   "It ain't gonna be that polite
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.600]   "in a little while down the road."
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.820]   Again, he knew that that's what he felt
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.660]   that he needed to project himself as,
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.460]   to present himself as, to get to where he wanted to get to.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.700]   He goes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.940]   - Did you see what Cuss was seeing
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.020]   in terms of the heavyweight champion of the world?
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:44.820]   - No, again, the easiest answer would be yes.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.020]   Teddy's just, Teddy Ellis, genius, wow, wow.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.620]   Teddy's, wow.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.500]   No, no, no, no.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.500]   But again, it was my job.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.500]   And I just, my job, it was simple, simpler than Cuss's.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.780]   Cuss knew too much.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.620]   I knew nothing.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.620]   I just knew rudiments of boxing.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.020]   I knew what it took to be a fighter
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.740]   and how to execute it, the steps of executing it.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.260]   So I took those steps.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.260]   The rest of it, you get blurred by those other things.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.180]   I wasn't blurred by those other things.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.960]   It was just, get 'em in the gym,
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.780]   make 'em mentally stronger, make 'em face things,
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.100]   and teach 'em how to slip punches,
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.740]   and create holes, and fill those frickin' holes
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.580]   with devastating punches, this is Cuss.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.220]   And what are you gonna do?
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.940]   I'm gonna teach 'em to fill holes
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.460]   and fill 'em with punches with bad intentions.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.060]   And that became the moniker.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.580]   And Tyson would say that.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.680]   I'm throwing punches with bad intentions.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.520]   Yes, you are.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.180]   - How do you make it mentally tougher?
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.300]   So that part of the job.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.980]   You said don't get a bloody nose,
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.020]   but the part of the job where it makes it mentally tougher,
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.280]   how do you do that?
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.060]   - Most important part of the job, to make 'em face things.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:04.020]   Make 'em face where he's lying to himself
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.380]   where he's submitting.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:08.220]   We start this conversation with submission.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:12.220]   Submit less, submit less, submit less every day.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.580]   Submit less.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.300]   'Cause I only come to the gym once in a while.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.900]   And if I had him sparring, he would come
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.340]   because that was his project, that was the heavyweight.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.740]   Now he came, you know, put my life in 'cause.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.580]   'Cause I had life.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.220]   He was losing a little life,
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.500]   but that made the light bulb bright again.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.340]   It did.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.300]   And it was great to see, I felt proud of that.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.740]   I felt connected to that.
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.140]   And that's why when it all went bad
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.620]   and 'cause to decide that the only side he could take,
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.180]   the side of the next heavyweight champ of the world.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:46.180]   But he left me, his partner, the young master.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.260]   And of the second time I'd get betrayed.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:55.100]   And I'm like, for a while,
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.580]   I thought everything Cus taught me, said to me was a lie.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.140]   I didn't want to be any part of it anymore.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.580]   Until I got a little more mature
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.580]   and I got a little past that where I was able to understand.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:16.940]   I was able to understand that just because so many people
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:22.780]   just because so many that you perceived as great
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.660]   in every area is you find to be weak in certain areas.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:33.500]   Doesn't mean that they can't still be what they want to you.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:37.260]   It's something that,
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:43.140]   it's something that can be understood or forgiven.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.460]   It's hard.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.420]   It's hard.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.780]   To get to that place and forgive somebody
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.780]   in that kind of way that I felt betrayed.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.940]   Because Cus told me the most important thing was loyalty.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.820]   Cus told me he loved me because I was loyal.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.500]   Cus told people that the reason that he went to court
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.020]   was because I didn't give up anybody,
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.860]   even though it meant putting me in a risk
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.020]   of going to jail for 10 years.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:12.980]   And Cus felt that he admired those traits.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.980]   And so I assumed that he would show the same traits.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.020]   And he took a deal.
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.900]   He took a deal.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.740]   He took a deal.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:28.180]   He signed the papers that those so-called feds of mine signed.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:34.380]   He took a deal to have the future heavyweight champions
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:42.580]   turned out and to let me go.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.580]   To sign the deal, to let me take the weight.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.140]   - For people who don't know,
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.220]   Mike was inappropriate with a young girl
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.620]   and you pulled a gun on him.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.940]   I don't know if there's deeper things
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.540]   to say about that situation.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.460]   - No.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:05.180]   - But why do you think Cus made the decision
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:09.340]   to cut you off from both Mike Tyson and from Cus D'Amato?
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.180]   Like to break that?
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.580]   When he valued loyalty so much.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.340]   - I served my purpose.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.740]   I got him to where he needed to get.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:21.140]   Brought life back in the gym.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.220]   If I wasn't in the gym at that particular time,
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.100]   Tyson never would have been in the gym.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.260]   There would have been no gym to bring him to.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.980]   When they called up and made that phone call
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.420]   to bring him to the gym, there would have been no activity.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.980]   There would have been no boxing program.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:37.100]   There would have been no trainer training him 24/7
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.500]   the way I was, where Cus wasn't capable of doing that
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.300]   at that point in his life.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.380]   But then again, it's not poor Teddy.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.740]   I get the benefit of a career.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.020]   I get the benefit of knowledge.
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.700]   I get the benefit of a life.
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.100]   I get the benefit of learning,
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.680]   of becoming hopefully a better person.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.740]   I get the benefit of being betrayed again.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.740]   But--
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.140]   - That's a hell of a statement right there.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.220]   I don't know what the benefit of that is.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.960]   - You can learn to forgive weakness.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   You know, when you realize how easy it is to be weak,
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:25.400]   and when you realize that, somebody asked me,
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.080]   how did you get to the point where you could forgive?
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.920]   Right, it's a pretty good question, pretty simple,
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.760]   pretty basic, pretty important, right?
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.240]   And I didn't understand, I understood,
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.320]   but I did understand immediately for me.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:45.460]   I said, how could I not forgive somebody?
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.480]   It becomes easier to learn how to forgive
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.940]   when you're still trying to forgive yourself,
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:58.920]   when you're still in the process of trying
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   to forgive yourself for your own inherent weaknesses
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.080]   and betrayals of people like my father.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.720]   And different ways that we forget very easily
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.800]   because it's handy and it's a way of surviving.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.360]   It's a lot easier to figure it out,
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:24.200]   rationalize it, to find forgiveness
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.040]   when you realize that you still haven't figured out
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.820]   completely how to forgive yourself.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:33.040]   I'm still trying to figure that out.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.840]   And so that helped me figure out how to forgive Cus,
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.480]   because to figure out how to forgive me,
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.920]   I had to understood why I did these things,
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.780]   where the weaknesses came from,
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.420]   where the selfishness came from,
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:55.520]   where the convenience came from, that they really existed.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.020]   But they didn't exist for malice,
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:03.240]   they existed for me not being prepared
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.200]   to understand that I could be stronger,
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.280]   to wanna be stronger.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.840]   And then I looked at Cus, he wanted to be stronger,
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.940]   but he got to a point in life where he had been strong
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.560]   for a lot of his life.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.160]   He was strong with me, he was strong
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.960]   with a lot of things in his life.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.760]   And does everyone deserve a pass in life
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:31.040]   where he got to a place where everything was in one,
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.800]   everything was in one basket, the basket of boxing.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.280]   He once told me that he never got married
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.720]   because it would have been selfish to a woman
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.660]   to have gotten married when his whole life was boxing,
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.400]   that he couldn't give to a kid, he couldn't give to her.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:52.240]   And then I thought about it, he had no money really,
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.000]   and Jim Jacobs and Bill Caden took care of the bills,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.160]   so he didn't really need money that way.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.300]   But what was the payoff for that kind of life,
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.880]   that kind of commitment, that kind of sacrifice?
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.780]   Really, what was the payoff?
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.920]   The payoff was to have champions,
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.020]   to have a champion that would keep your name alive.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:20.440]   That word legacy, what does it mean?
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:25.200]   Sometimes it's just a word, sometimes it's more than a word.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   It's a reprieve, it's a pension plan.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.680]   It's being given a pension on your way out
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.040]   for the rest of your life, for your life,
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.260]   wherever you're going, you're going to wherever you're going
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:45.260]   for eternity, it's the only thing that you take with you
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.560]   is what you left behind.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.560]   And for Cuss, it was all about leaving behind a mark,
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.600]   a mark of champion.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.320]   Yeah, it was attached to ego, we all have it.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:00.760]   Yeah, it was attached to some selfishness and all,
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.600]   but yeah, it was also attached
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.700]   to wanting to leave something great behind,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.380]   to know that you were part of it,
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.620]   that you existed for a reason,
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.240]   that you sacrificed for a reason.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.060]   And all that freaking pain I brought my father,
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.280]   I was searching for something.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.800]   Yeah, I made it into a righteous search.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.120]   I made it into, I did.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.480]   And I made it into, it was okay because it was righteous.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.340]   But it still did damage.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:37.080]   It still did damage, it still hurt people.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.360]   It still betrayed my father's trust.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.840]   And Cuss betrayed mine, but he didn't do it maliciously.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.520]   He did it out of, again,
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.520]   my father came home, this is how I'm gonna connect it.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.200]   My father came home from work one night,
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.640]   12 o'clock and I was waiting out.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.000]   And like I said, I was over nine, 10 years old.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:05.840]   And he got mad at me.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.120]   He goes, "Go to bed, what are you doing up?"
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.080]   I said, "I'm waiting for you, waiting for you."
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.920]   And he said, "Well, go to bed."
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.960]   I said, "No, what were you doing?"
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.520]   He said, "I was at the hospital."
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.320]   "You were there, why were you there so late?"
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.520]   He answered me.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.280]   He said, "There was a patient, it was a sick patient."
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.320]   I said, "Oh, he must be better now
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.720]   "because you're his doctor."
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.480]   Because my father could fix anything.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.720]   My father, nothing got in the way of the truth, nothing.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.600]   Nothing, even blown his son's bubble.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.120]   Matter of factly, he said to me,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.480]   "No, he's not gonna get better, he's gonna die."
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:14:00.080]   So as a nine-year-old kid, you know, you're a kid,
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.200]   you're selfish, you know, not in a bad way,
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.940]   but you know, you want what you want.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.940]   And I said, I said two things.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.880]   First, I said, "How, you're his doctor, how?"
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.320]   I mean, it can't be.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.480]   And then I said, I just said it almost angry.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.400]   "Then why were you there?"
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.040]   Like, "You should have been here with me."
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.680]   - Yeah.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.660]   - And you know what he said to me?
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.560]   "Because you don't give up on life, go to bed."
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.120]   - Don't give up on life.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.480]   - And that's, I finally connected the dots.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.680]   This idiot that didn't graduate high school,
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.800]   I finally connected the dots.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.880]   I was asking Cus to give up on life.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.480]   You know, you don't give up on life,
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.640]   you don't give up on aspirations of life.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.160]   Life is all forms of life.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.600]   Doesn't have to be a physical form of it.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.980]   It's life, it's having a reason to be alive.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.320]   It's having a reason to have tomorrow.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.280]   And Cus's only reason to have tomorrow
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.040]   was to have another heavyweight champ.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.560]   And Teddy Atlas, even though we were together
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.640]   all those years, and we were partners,
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.800]   and we trained together, and we were,
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.960]   we were, you know, the only thing we didn't do
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.920]   was what they did in the Indian movies,
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.800]   where they cut the finger and they became blood brothers.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.200]   That's the only thing we didn't do.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.320]   And I felt like we did that without cutting.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   And now here we are, and he freaking betrayed me.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.040]   And then all of a sudden I connected the dots.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:45.040]   I was like, he didn't betray me in that cold sense.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.480]   He didn't give up on life.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:56.520]   - Years later, Mike Tyson apologized to you.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:01.500]   What's meaningful to you about that?
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.080]   How does that fit the story?
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.800]   - I wanna be the great, gracious guy right now,
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   say, oh, I'm so human that, you know,
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:17.080]   a man's man enough to say, sorry, that's it, we're good.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:22.080]   I wanna be, really, that's the best presentation
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.640]   of Teddy Atlas I could put out there.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.720]   He's a good guy.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.800]   He forgives, he's a good guy.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.880]   He's a stand-up guy, and he's a good guy.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.760]   I'm not sure.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.920]   If he truly did it for himself,
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   that he really did it because he felt that it was true.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:53.880]   But if he's persuaded by other things,
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.080]   he was in the middle, I know I'm taking it too deep,
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.680]   I know it, but what am I gonna do?
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.360]   He was in the middle of 12 steps with the, you know,
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360]   getting out of drugs, alcohol, 12 steps,
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.840]   which is a commemorable thing, really, it is.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.000]   And he's taking the steps, and part of the steps
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.880]   was to admit or to apologize
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.360]   to all people you offended in life.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:18.360]   Okay, but are you doing it for the 12 steps,
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:23.080]   or are you doing it because you really, truly
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:28.720]   have come to terms with believing what you did
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.300]   was that hurtful to me, and that it matters to you
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.920]   that it was that hurtful to me,
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.520]   and that you were wrong in doing it?
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.260]   Did you do it for, and I know that's deep,
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.860]   I know that I'm a freaking idiot,
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:45.120]   you're a Teddy freaking, you should be better than that.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.920]   He's better than you.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.120]   Yeah, maybe he is better than me.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.920]   Maybe he is, really, seriously, maybe he is.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.400]   And I took it, he put his hand, I took it,
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.400]   we hugged, he said, "I love you."
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.440]   Yeah, yeah, but I wanna believe.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.040]   But what did Cuss tell me?
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.980]   No matter what a man says, it's what he does in the end
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.380]   that he intended to do all along.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:16.620]   So to this day, today, was it really genuine,
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.460]   or was it reflexive of that moment for him
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:24.020]   to get what he needed for that step?
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:29.020]   Or was it truly for what I needed?
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:34.220]   To really, that he really cared that what he did to me
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.040]   caused me to do what I did?
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.880]   Because I did something that was pretty damn bad to him too.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.360]   Is he able to deal with that,
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.960]   and put that where it has to be put?
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.520]   Is he able to put that, or is it just,
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.920]   he did something he had to do,
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.900]   and maybe he's sorry he did it?
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:19:01.160]   Look, I appreciate it that he,
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.000]   I would've rather been in a private place.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.140]   - Yeah, so what people don't know,
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.260]   you were in the middle of commentating a fight,
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:09.960]   and he walked up from behind you,
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.180]   and he said he was sorry, he shook your hand,
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:15.740]   gave you a hug, I didn't know he said, "I love you."
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.820]   - Yeah, he's emotional.
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.580]   I get emotional a little bit too.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:23.220]   But he's emotional, and he can be,
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.420]   I can see why people have a fascination
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.740]   and a love affair with him right now.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:32.740]   'Cause he was the meteor that went across the sky,
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:38.980]   that is, if they didn't see it,
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.180]   their parents told them about it.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.460]   There was a meteor that came across the sky one day,
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.460]   and the meteor's walking around in a room now,
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.500]   and that's the meteorite, and it actually landed here,
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.240]   and that's it right there.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:55.240]   And now he's come a long way, and now he's more human,
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:20:00.700]   and he's lovable, and compassionate,
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:04.860]   and he cries, and I get the fascination,
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.020]   I get the love affair, I get it.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.980]   Because we're inherently, we're people that wanna forgive.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:12.580]   We're people that, we wanna be good,
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:14.940]   and part of being good is to forgive people,
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.460]   and to show compassion to people.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:21.920]   And so, and when somebody's been damaged,
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.820]   to acknowledge they've been damaged,
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.300]   to acknowledge that you know they've been damaged,
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.020]   and you care about them being damaged.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.780]   And how do you show care?
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.900]   Through admiration.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:37.140]   In some ways, almost through adulation.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.140]   And he's getting adulation from people,
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:43.100]   which is to an incredible level.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:47.020]   And it's a phenomena, but I get it.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.540]   I understand it.
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.220]   And I don't know if he gets it.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.540]   I don't know if underneath all of this,
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.620]   he's a complex guy, he's a sensitive guy.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.060]   I don't know, and I am too.
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.900]   - One complex guy talking about another complex guy.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.980]   - I don't know if underneath it all,
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.660]   where he's really, truly at,
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:12.680]   as far as that day that he said that to me.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.260]   - Is there part of you that's sorry to Mike?
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.480]   For pulling the gun on him?
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.740]   - Yeah, and that's, listen, that's fair.
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.340]   I know dimensions of human nature too well
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:28.500]   to not know that he still has to have certain,
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.680]   because I have those strong feelings.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.540]   What, it's not fair for him to have them?
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:34.640]   Damn right it's fair.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.020]   Now, he could look at it,
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.100]   if he was to be held to his word that night,
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:44.260]   that he just acknowledges that what happened,
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.820]   he deserved because of what he,
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.500]   the position he put me in,
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.080]   and he put himself in, what he did.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.660]   And I wouldn't change nothing, you know?
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:58.260]   - Still, you don't regret pulling the gun on him.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.280]   - I regret that I had to.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.700]   Yeah, I regret very much that I had to,
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.860]   that I regret very much.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.220]   - He crossed the line.
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.740]   - I hated him for putting me in that position.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.940]   That, you know, how dare he think
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.920]   that somebody's feelings are that trivial?
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.900]   That the way I would feel about myself
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.020]   and the way the girl would feel about herself,
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.700]   that was 11 years old at the time,
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.260]   how she would feel about herself.
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:30.700]   How dare he think it's that trivial that, you know,
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:33.800]   that I shouldn't be ready to freaking,
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.420]   to both die and kill for that.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:40.780]   - Why didn't Custom Otto see it in a deeper way
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.540]   and talk through it?
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.900]   - The word came back to me,
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:46.540]   but of course, what does it mean?
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:51.380]   But the word came back to me that Cust said you were right,
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:54.500]   but if he took the side of Teddy,
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:59.340]   he would destroy potentially a great fighter.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.220]   - Why do you think that, okay,
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:04.060]   if you were to try to understand the point he was making,
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.700]   why is that true?
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.540]   Isn't the part of greatness that you said
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.820]   is building the character of knowing what is right?
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.900]   - Cust was afraid to go there
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.340]   where he used to not be afraid
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:20.980]   because it's kind of like, you're never afraid of going up.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.740]   And I get it.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:24.140]   You know, when I train a fighter now,
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.660]   if I come out of retirement, I train a fighter now,
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:31.660]   I feel in camp, like I feel like I'm on death row every day,
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:37.940]   that every day I try to retrace my memory
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.780]   and say, did I feel this way when I was younger?
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.540]   I don't remember feeling this way.
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.420]   I feel every day a dreadful feeling
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:48.820]   that if I don't get this right, I've betrayed everything.
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.500]   I've betrayed the fighter's trust.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.180]   I've betrayed what I'm supposed to be.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.340]   And then one day I tried to figure it out.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:56.660]   Why do I feel this way?
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.020]   It's so intense.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.340]   I was in camp for two months
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:03.460]   training a guy for the world title a few years ago,
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.140]   fighting the hardest puncher in the world at the time,
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.900]   and Adonis Stevenson, and the fighter was Ukrainian.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:12.900]   And I was brought in to train him for that fight.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.620]   And he trusted me and changed his whole style, trusted me.
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:19.180]   Oh my God, I went to bed every night like praying,
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:24.020]   dread, waking up dread, my stomach down to here,
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.140]   every day saying, what if I fail him?
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:30.500]   What if everything that I told him was gonna happen
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.580]   don't happen?
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:32.860]   What if I fail him?
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.540]   What if he trusted me?
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.500]   And I betrayed that trust.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.660]   And the thing was, what cost was,
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:44.620]   he used to be stronger than that.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.660]   And then I tried to figure it out why I got this way
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.620]   and why it was so dreadful to me
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.780]   and why I felt like I was on that role every day
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.700]   training a fighter.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.740]   Like, did I do enough?
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.580]   Did I do it right?
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.180]   Will we accomplish what we,
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.140]   will we accomplish what I promised him
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.340]   we would accomplish?
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.740]   Would I keep my word?
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.500]   And then I started thinking, how did I become this weak?
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.620]   How did I freaking become,
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.340]   I was a pretty strong freaking guy.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.620]   How did I become this weak?
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:12.180]   And then finally I think I figured it out.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.340]   You know why?
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.900]   Because I was always working to get up.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:19.060]   But once I finally got up, now I was looking down.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.980]   And I finally hit me.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:22.940]   I said, I didn't wanna lose.
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.900]   I said, there was nothing to lose on my way up.
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.340]   Now all of a sudden there's something to lose
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:29.500]   when you're up there and you're looking down.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.620]   - And that's where he was.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.540]   - And that's where Cuzz was.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.180]   Cuzz was at the end of his rope.
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:36.780]   He accomplished the two world champs,
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.180]   all this stuff, right?
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.020]   Everything.
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:41.300]   And he did it right.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:44.700]   Now all of a sudden it wasn't about moving forward.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.380]   It was about not falling down.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:49.260]   Holy cow.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.300]   I was like, I got it, Cuzz.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:52.660]   I got it.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:53.700]   I got it.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.860]   You didn't wanna fall down.
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.100]   Oh my God.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:57.940]   You didn't wanna fall.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:01.140]   And he, this was his last chance
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.420]   you don't give up on life.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:07.900]   This was his last chance to live forever.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:12.300]   To make everything he did worthwhile.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.300]   To have the youngest, it wasn't just heavyweight champ.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.660]   You gotta remember, he was the youngest
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.060]   heavyweight champ ever.
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.600]   And to have that, it was okay to die now.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.600]   And how's loyalty, someone named Teddy Atlas
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:32.620]   gonna get in the way of that?
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.420]   That's a tidal wave.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.260]   That there ain't no wall that's been made high enough
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:39.460]   to stop that tidal wave.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.020]   And now I'll stop myself.
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.460]   Yeah, there is.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.700]   But it would have to be an awful big one.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:48.780]   And you know what?
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:52.180]   Who are we to say that we could ever build that wall that big?
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.220]   Who is any of us?
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.360]   Who am I to say?
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.180]   - Do you think, if you were to put yourself
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:58.560]   in the shoes of Cuzz Tomato,
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.680]   can you see yourself having the big enough wall
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.080]   or you would choose loyalty?
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.960]   - Now if I answer the way I feel,
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:13.280]   then I'm making myself John Wayne again.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.800]   - You don't have to answer that.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.320]   I think loyalty is important.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.420]   - No matter what a man says, what he does in the end,
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.520]   that he intends to do all along.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.960]   I didn't make that up, Cuzz did.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.180]   And when this all went down,
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:33.020]   those words came freaking echoing into my freaking ears.
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.060]   I didn't want them.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:37.480]   Cotton doesn't help.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.940]   And they freaking kept coming into my ears.
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:42.940]   And what do you think?
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.080]   Still an immature kid at the time.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.340]   You know, I was young.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:49.100]   Still an immature kid at the time.
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:52.500]   What the freak do you think my response was?
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.960]   You were full of,
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.420]   but I got past that.
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:27:59.900]   - Do you forgive Cuzz?
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.340]   Have you found forgiveness?
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:06.140]   - Listen, I forgive him because
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:10.120]   he gave me more than he took away from me.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:13.820]   If I can, what kind of man am I
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.460]   to if I can at least acknowledge that
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:17.660]   and be grateful for that?
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.380]   He gave me more than he took from me.
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:24.260]   And I'm grateful for that.
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:26.260]   I'm also grateful for what I gave him.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.900]   That I did give him something.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.960]   And at that point in his life,
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:44.500]   a place to still have test tubes
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.140]   and chemistry experiments.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:51.740]   A laboratory where he could still create great fire.
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.500]   And I helped give him that.
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.860]   I helped, I was part of that lab
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.560]   and making sure that lab was there.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.220]   And just that there was the existence
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:04.380]   of test tubes in the place
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.480]   because you can't freaking do experiments
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.460]   without test tubes.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:10.100]   - Now you're the scientist with the test tubes.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:12.300]   - Yeah, I guess so.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:15.060]   And I just hope that,
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:19.500]   what I said earlier is really,
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:25.020]   it's really my thread through this whole thing.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:26.140]   When you say, "Can you forgive?"
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:31.140]   'Cause I'm still trying to forgive myself.
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:38.180]   And if I can have hope that I can forgive myself,
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:41.340]   I think that hope has to start
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:44.560]   with the power to forgive someone else.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   How can I ever forgive myself for all my failings
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.780]   and figure it out if I can't start and practice it
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:59.200]   by forgiving someone else for some shortcomings?
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:06.140]   And for me, that's the only sense of,
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:11.060]   sometimes a very hard thing to make sense of.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:14.560]   That's my North Star.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.620]   That's my compass.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.060]   'Cause just to make me laugh,
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.700]   you know, me and him did everything together.
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:24.240]   We drive and we get lost in the city.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.620]   We get lost in the park and he'd get all frustrated.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:30.460]   And he said, "Atlas, you're a great trainer,
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.860]   "but you turn you around, you spin you around,
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:33.940]   "and you're lost."
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:37.380]   And I said, "Me or we?"
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.600]   Because I was the only one who would argue with him.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.960]   And it was really funny sometimes.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.260]   And I said, "We or me?
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:47.140]   "You or, we or," and he goes, "Ah, I don't care.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:50.560]   "Cuz, you're lost, I'm lost.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.420]   "What are you talking about?"
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.420]   And then all of a sudden, Cuz couldn't give in.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:55.820]   He just couldn't admit.
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:56.660]   He couldn't give in.
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.260]   You know what he said to me?
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:01.540]   All of a sudden he goes, "When I was in the Army,
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.700]   "if I had a compass, I could get out of the woods."
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.020]   I said, "We're not in the woods.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:05.860]   "We're not in the Army.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.860]   "We don't have a compass, Cuz.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:12.860]   "Cuz, just don't argue with me."
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:17.180]   One time we're driving, I wanna get back to Catskill.
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.400]   We just finished at the Bronx.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.500]   It's been a long day.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.340]   - Yeah.
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:25.340]   - You know, visiting the Murderous Inks houses
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.940]   and everything else that he took me through
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:30.620]   for the 1800th time.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:33.860]   And he would fall asleep.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.100]   You know, he was getting older.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.620]   And he would just fall asleep in the car.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:38.660]   So what do you think?
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.140]   I went a little faster, right?
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:42.740]   Because before he went to sleep, he said, "Don't speed."
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:46.620]   So I don't consider myself, I try to be an honest guy.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:50.940]   And I try to be a freaking, but, you know.
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.260]   - It was the five or six guys.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.180]   - What did I say earlier?
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.540]   Try to do less submitting.
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:56.420]   - Yeah.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:59.780]   - Really, in all phases, try to submit a little less.
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:01.440]   Try to lie a little less today.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.260]   A little less.
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:05.380]   Try to get stronger.
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:06.740]   Try to get a little better.
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:11.620]   So here we are, and we're driving.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.220]   And all of a sudden, he's, what did I do?
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:17.140]   80, 75, probably, probably did.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.940]   You know, whatever.
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:22.380]   And all of a sudden, he wakes up.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:26.300]   You were speeding.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.860]   Oh, I lie, no I wasn't.
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.980]   Don't lie.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.900]   I'm not lying.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.660]   He lied again.
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:36.580]   You were speeding.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:39.060]   Now, come on.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.580]   This guy, he's, you know what I mean?
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:43.700]   He's unbelievable.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:47.380]   So I gotta freaking, you know, he's David Copperfield.
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.900]   I wanna know the trick.
[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.060]   I wanna know how he freaking,
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.500]   he made this thing disappear.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:56.140]   So I said, "What are you talking, how do you know?"
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:59.020]   He goes, "'Cause I timed you."
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:02.700]   I looked at the post number, and I'm like, "What?"
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:05.620]   I looked at the post number on the side of the road,
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.660]   where we were, whatever miles,
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:10.220]   and I never knew they even existed.
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:12.060]   I look, and I said, "Yeah, there's little numbers."
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.780]   - He started timing, and then fell asleep.
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.700]   - Yeah, he timed it, and he goes,
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.660]   "We couldn't have got from here to there
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:18.780]   "in that amount of time,
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:21.260]   "unless you were going 75 miles an hour."
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:26.260]   And I'm like, "All right, I'm impressed."
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:30.740]   Don't try to get the mile per hour part right.
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:32.260]   It's enough that you got me.
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.020]   That's enough.
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:40.660]   Yeah, I said, "And I'm not gonna do that, no, I'm,"
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:45.340]   you know, and just, he helped me in crazy ways
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.260]   where there would be times where I wanted to be,
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.620]   you know, where you wanted to be whatever, right?
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.860]   Convenient, weak, submit, right?
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:57.340]   And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden,
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.300]   in my mind, Cus was there with the stopwatch.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.860]   (laughs)
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:05.340]   And I'd be like, you know,
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.780]   "No," you know, where I was about to say yes
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:13.380]   to whatever that particular situation was.
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:16.420]   (phone ringing)
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:19.340]   Somebody's up there calling.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:20.940]   Hello?
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.780]   Hello?
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:25.140]   Yes, you're great.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:25.980]   Thank you.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:30.940]   Just for the record,
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.500]   I've never had a phone call like this.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.460]   It's hotel security.
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:37.900]   The question is, he asked me is, "Are you okay, sir?"
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:38.940]   Are you okay?
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.780]   Are we okay?
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:41.340]   I think so.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.140]   I think so, so far.
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.580]   You know, I can only go like so far.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.460]   It's kind of like that old joke, you know,
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:51.260]   where the guy jumps off the Empire State Building.
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.580]   He's falling down, and he's going, you know,
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:56.420]   80th floor, 70th floor, 60th floor, 50,
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.100]   and he gets past the 50th floor,
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.260]   and they're looking out the window,
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.900]   and he goes, "How am I doing?"
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:02.340]   So far, so good.
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:05.660]   I don't know where it's gonna end, but.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.180]   So, Mike Dyson is considered by many
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:11.500]   to be one of the great boxers,
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.500]   one of the greatest boxers of all time,
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.020]   heavyweight boxers.
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.060]   What do you think, on the positive side, made him great?
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.620]   I don't know if he was ever great.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:25.060]   I know he was sensational.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:27.860]   I know he was the greatest mix
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.660]   of maybe speed and power ever.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:32.340]   I know he was one of the greatest punchers
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:34.700]   from either side of the plate, left or right.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.540]   There's been great punchers with just the right hand,
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:41.460]   like Ernie Chavis and Deontay Wilder and Max Baer.
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:43.180]   I don't know if there's ever been anyone
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:45.260]   who could punch as good as he did on either side
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:48.700]   with either hand, other than Joe Louis and a few others.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:51.660]   I don't know if there's ever been such a combination
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:55.940]   of speed and power to that pure level that he had,
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.020]   and it was a pure level.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.620]   I don't know if there was ever as good a fighter
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.820]   as Tyson was, where maybe one night he was great,
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:04.820]   where he wasn't tested,
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.780]   but he might've been ready to be tested
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.220]   that one night against Michael Spinks,
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:12.140]   when he took him apart in 90 seconds.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.180]   I think I saw a great fighter that night.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.820]   I don't think you can be great
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:22.820]   unless you have all the requirements of being great.
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:25.580]   What does it take to be a great fighter?
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.700]   Truly great.
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:30.180]   (silence)
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:36.260]   To not rely on someone else's weakness to be strong.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:40.460]   To be strong on your own.
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:42.940]   Too often he relied on other people's weakness,
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:45.860]   whether it's by being intimidated,
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.500]   or whether it was because his talent
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.380]   was so much greater than theirs,
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:52.740]   that it was like putting a monster truck in there
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:56.580]   with a Volkswagen, and the Volkswagen was gonna get crushed.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.420]   No matter how much horsepower the Volkswagen
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:02.180]   might've had under the hood, and you put under the hood,
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.220]   it was gonna get crushed.
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:07.780]   The monster truck was not gonna allow it to be a contest.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:12.780]   And to be able to find a way
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.860]   when your talent wasn't enough.
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.980]   He didn't find a way when his talent wasn't enough.
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.180]   And I'm not making statements
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:23.500]   if I'm not ready to put some evidence.
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:26.140]   You know, like if we were in a courtroom, exhibit A.
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:31.580]   When he fought Buster Douglas,
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:36.260]   Buster Douglas matched his will,
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:39.860]   and didn't get intimidated, stood up to him.
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.620]   He didn't do what most people did.
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.300]   He didn't submit even a little bit.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.140]   Not that night.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:48.580]   He had in the past, but that night he didn't.
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:49.420]   Why?
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.420]   Because Buster had a secret weapon that night, his mother.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:57.620]   Buster's mother had died a few months previous.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.540]   He loved his mother very much.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.780]   Buster had always had talent, big heavyweight,
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.620]   talented, could punch, technically solid.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:08.620]   It was all those things, always was.
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:09.740]   But he quit in fights.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.940]   He did less than he should've done.
[01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.660]   He never lived up to his ability.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:16.020]   He gave in, he submitted.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.660]   He wasn't strong enough.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:20.180]   He never had a reason to be strong enough.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.780]   When his mother died, he had a reason.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:25.500]   Nothing could hurt him as much as his mother dying hurt him,
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.580]   Mike Tyson included.
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:31.660]   That night, Mike Tyson could not hurt him
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:34.540]   as much as his mother had hurt him by dying.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:38.500]   That night, he had a reason to be strong for his mother,
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:39.340]   and he was strong.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:42.700]   He was everything he was supposed to be, and more.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.020]   And he stood up to Mike.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:47.500]   And Mike, for the first time, maybe ever,
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.500]   was in a fight where he had to overcome something,
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.820]   where he had to be more than talented,
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:56.420]   more than a puncher, more than a guy with scintillating speed.
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.300]   And he wasn't.
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.620]   And then that night got followed by another night
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:02.460]   with Holyfield.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:05.900]   Holyfield wasn't as talented as him,
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:10.900]   as big as a puncher, but Holyfield had the character.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:17.220]   He was strong in ways that Tyson wasn't strong.
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:21.860]   He was strong in a way where he could find a way.
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:24.180]   He was willing to find a way.
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.220]   He's willing to go to the cliff
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:30.620]   to truly die before he's submitted.
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:33.060]   You know, a lot of stuff is just words.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:35.780]   They're gonna have to carry me out on the shield.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.660]   Yeah, sure, okay.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:40.820]   Yeah, until it comes time to be carried out on the shield.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:43.320]   Sometimes there's people that actually mean it.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.540]   - You think Mike didn't have that?
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:51.660]   - Well, all right, let's just say arbitrarily,
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.540]   I don't have his record for me.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:55.060]   Let's say it was 55 and five.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.940]   I know he had about five losses.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:59.220]   All right, let's say it was 55 and five, right?
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.220]   A lot of knockouts.
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:05.700]   I have a saying, a fight's not a fight
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.460]   until there's something to overcome.
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:12.300]   Until then, it's just an athletic exhibition, contest.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.540]   Yeah, who's a better athlete?
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.100]   Who's got more quick twitch fibers?
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.860]   Who's more developed?
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:18.740]   Who's better at this?
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:21.600]   Who's more developed in those physical areas?
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.820]   But a fight is not a fight
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.580]   until there's something to overcome.
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:30.580]   Okay, so if you go by my definition, not Webster's,
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:33.860]   my definition, which I think means something,
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:40.180]   Mike Tyson was only in five fights in his life.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.440]   The five fights where there was something to overcome
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:47.060]   and he didn't overcome it.
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:51.240]   Now, I know people hate me for this, including Tyson.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:54.040]   I understand them, hate me.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.040]   Oh, you're a hater 'cause you weren't with him.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.840]   You didn't make the money because this, because that,
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.080]   because you got betrayed.
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.740]   I think I'm better than that.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.760]   I hope I'm better than that.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:05.840]   I believe I'm better than that.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.400]   I'm not a hater.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.680]   I've broadcast fights for 25 years on ESPN
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:13.440]   where there was some people in the corner I did not like.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.280]   And if they did a good job, this guy's doing a great job.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.960]   And then there were guys that I liked
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.320]   and I had friendship, but he messed up.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.880]   And we weren't friends no more.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:27.320]   Friendship got to be tested, remember that?
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.120]   So we weren't friends no more.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.140]   But why did I do that?
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:33.940]   Because it was my job.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.200]   It was more important for me.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.360]   When it's all over with, the only thing you're left with is,
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.320]   I mean, we're gonna be dust, all of us, right?
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:49.160]   The only thing we're left with is what carries on,
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.760]   our reputation, you know, legacy, whatever that is.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.560]   But our reputation, that's all we're left with.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.980]   And that's all our kids are left with.
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:05.680]   I want it to be as good as it can be.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.080]   I've always had an ability.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.320]   I've done a lot of things wrong
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.880]   and I've had a lot of lackings.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.320]   But the one strength I've had, if I had a strength,
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:20.720]   is to understand somehow, through osmosis, I guess,
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:27.440]   to learn the lesson that what's important
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:33.120]   is not what's in front of you for those five seconds,
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.540]   for that moment in life.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.400]   It's what's left behind you
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.080]   when those five seconds are gone.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.680]   Whatever it is that you're dealing with,
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:48.220]   you know, whatever that moment is, whatever,
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:51.780]   that moment, what you do in that moment,
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:59.520]   the action of that moment is gonna stay with you and be you.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.860]   It's gonna become you.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.640]   What you face for that moment,
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:15.280]   it's gone, it's gone in the air in an instant.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.960]   It's gone, it's done.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.760]   Whether you stand up there and you get shot in the head
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.080]   and the guy freaking blows your brains out
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.360]   or you're freaking, you stand up here
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:30.320]   or you're fighting a guy who's like a scary guy to fight,
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.760]   but you fight him and you beat him or he beats you up.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:38.760]   But how you represented yourself in that moment
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:47.280]   is all that matters.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:48.120]   That's gonna live.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.080]   What happened don't matter.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.760]   It don't matter that you got shot in the head.
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.600]   I know that sounds absurd,
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.200]   but if you believe that it was important to stand up
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.920]   and take the chance to get shot in the freaking head
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.020]   rather than to live like an empty vessel, you know what?
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:09.040]   That's all that freaking matters.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.440]   And somehow that got freaking wrapped
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.160]   into this freaking head of mine.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.920]   That's what matters.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.680]   That's all that matters.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:21.280]   How many times I went and I did things,
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.560]   whether it was with this one, with Tyson, with that,
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.560]   I didn't wanna be there.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.840]   I was scared to death.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:31.520]   But I was more scared, I was more scared--
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:32.560]   - Living with regret.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.520]   - How I would have felt.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.640]   I don't wanna be in solitary confinement
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.960]   the rest of my life with that freaking guy
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.280]   in the cell next to me called regret.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.560]   I don't freaking wanna be next to that guy.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.640]   If I wanna freaking go down that road,
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.920]   I'll watch Papillon, you know what I mean?
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:50.160]   And I'll get my fill from that.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.920]   But I don't wanna freaking live it.
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:55.260]   I'm afraid of what my children would think of me
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:59.040]   if I fail in those areas.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.440]   Why?
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.960]   Because that's forever.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:07.000]   When I'm closing my eyes for the last time,
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.200]   I don't wanna have that fear.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.360]   I don't wanna have that fear.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.680]   You know, whether I'm going down there
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:16.200]   or whether I'm going up there.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:21.200]   You know, I laugh because I was around guys years ago
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.480]   that used to, when we'd talk about that, you know,
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.560]   and just, you know, and I would get a kick out
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:33.120]   of this one guy who'd been around the block a few times,
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.400]   when he'd say, "Hey, Teddy, I ain't worried about that.
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:39.200]   "I got friends in both places."
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.880]   (laughing)
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.880]   - That's a good line.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:46.680]   - And I thought it was good.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:51.680]   Listen, Mike Tyson, you want me to say he was a great fighter
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.800]   then you want me to betray what I really,
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.880]   you know what I mean, you want me to do that?
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.040]   I ain't doing it for, listen,
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.320]   I could do it to be a bigger Teddy Atlas
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.080]   and I know it would work for me.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:05.680]   I know it would be, it'd do great promotional work for me.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:08.880]   I know it would make me more popular in certain area.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:09.800]   I know it.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.960]   I'm not that dumb, not that dumb.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:15.860]   But I also know what else it would do to me.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:19.520]   And I don't want it to do that to me.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.200]   I think he was a great talent.
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.120]   I think maybe the night with Michael Spinks,
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:24.680]   maybe the night with Mike,
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.280]   maybe he could have been that fighter.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.680]   But he didn't never really get tested.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.520]   But he might've been ready no matter what,
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.720]   I have, to be tested that night.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.880]   That's how good he was.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.320]   That's how, even though he was a guy
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.420]   who used to be a light heavyweight, I get it.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.080]   But was still a guy who beat Larry Holmes,
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.600]   who still has something left, Michael Spinks.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:44.920]   So, and a great puncher, and an Olympic gold medalist.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.920]   But, and a special fighter,
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.320]   one of the great light heavyweights of all time.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.800]   You know what Mike Tyson was?
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.360]   He was a meteor.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.060]   He was a meteor that struck across
[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:55.720]   and not too many meteors,
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.800]   and we still talk about him.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.320]   And unlike Haley's comment, he came back.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.120]   And he's walking around.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:08.480]   And he has become greater after his career.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:12.120]   More loved, more beloved, more awed.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:13.760]   And he's been forgiven.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.760]   He found the fountain of forgiveness.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.260]   I don't know, I wish I could find that.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:22.800]   Where he has been forgotten for all his shortcomings,
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.280]   all the things that he may have done, may not have done,
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.200]   we don't know, only him and God know.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:30.400]   But he's been forgiven of all that,
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.720]   and he's been not only forgiven,
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:37.080]   he's rised above it and above that,
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.400]   and been brought above that.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.040]   He's been brought to the pyramids
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:47.040]   of the greatest athletes in the world.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:54.360]   And in every way, in every way as a person,
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:58.540]   as a fighter, as a historian,
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:04.760]   as a figure, as a celebrity, I mean--
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.320]   - Even a philosopher.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.940]   - Everything.
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.760]   So I will take it back.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.040]   All right, all you guys out there, you forgive me?
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.120]   He's the greatest of all time,
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.240]   if you encapsulate all that.
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:19.080]   If you encapsulate everything I just tried to describe
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:22.440]   and explain, if you put that all,
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.560]   he's the greatest of all time.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.400]   Yeah, he is.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:29.400]   But he still might be 0-5 in a record of 55 fights.
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.960]   He might, in Teddy Atlas' book,
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:37.380]   again, I got friends in both places,
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.940]   so it's okay, wherever I go, I have company.
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:44.500]   Somebody there will like me, despite me saying this.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.180]   He might be 0-5 because of five fights
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.480]   where there was something to overcome,
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.640]   which really defines a fight.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.840]   He didn't find a way.
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:58.640]   - Let me ask Teddy Atlas to introspect
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.120]   on the human nature here.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.640]   It's part of the complexities of your feelings
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.640]   on this whole thing is that you know to some degree
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.560]   that if you were coaching Mike Tyson,
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.160]   he could be truly great throughout--
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.000]   - I know, Cole, I'm gonna cut you right off
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.720]   because you asked a million dollar question.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:19.360]   I wish you didn't, but you did.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.440]   You did, 'cause that's why--
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.280]   - When do I get paid?
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.480]   - That's why you get paid.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:24.320]   I get it.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.520]   You took the words out of my mouth.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.280]   That's why you are where you are.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.720]   And that's why I'm here.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.320]   - The humility.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.920]   - I'm gonna, again, full disclosure, it's important, right?
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:41.280]   I'm gonna cheat.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:44.280]   I'm gonna take some of Cus' wisdom, all right?
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.320]   A little bit of mine.
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:53.960]   Cus told somebody that if Teddy Atlas got his way,
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:56.640]   he might have been a better person,
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.440]   but we would have risked him not being a great fighter.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.360]   Now, I believe, and I thought Cus did,
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.480]   and I think he did up to that point in his life,
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.320]   that part of your strength of character
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.320]   made you a great fighter, and truly a great fighter,
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.520]   and part of that battle to be a better person,
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.880]   that fight, if you will, to be a better person,
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.180]   to overcome the things, to be a better person,
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:26.520]   part of that fire you have to go through
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:30.920]   to be a better person, I really, truly bought into it,
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:33.440]   and I'm in for life.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:38.760]   That is really the only way to be a great fighter,
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.760]   and I don't think that's what Cus meant.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000]   I think he meant that Cus knew more than I did
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.360]   of what was about to come, and what would come,
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.080]   and what the world was,
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.480]   how people would try to steal him,
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.560]   how people would take him,
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:01.340]   how people would steal his guy.
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:07.600]   The last thing he had, really,
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:11.440]   the thing that he lived for,
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.000]   'cause he lived to have another heavyweight champ,
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.480]   the greatest fighter ever, Cus, in Cus's mind,
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:17.960]   that he could be,
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:22.960]   and I believe that Cus knew that he could put forward
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:28.320]   a guy that had the ability to be the greatest fighter ever
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:30.520]   without fully completing the mission
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.760]   of what it takes to really be great,
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:36.360]   but that he wouldn't be around to have to witness it,
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:40.680]   and that he wouldn't,
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:45.580]   he was willing to, oh man, this is awful,
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:51.100]   he's willing to concede that he might be dead
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:53.100]   in order to have eternal life,
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:54.740]   in order to have greatness,
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:57.300]   which Cus does have greatness,
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:51:59.900]   and part of that greatness is attached to Tyson,
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:00.740]   and he deserves it.
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:02.580]   He deserves it, Cus was a great man,
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:06.060]   and I wouldn't be here partly without him.
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.740]   - But that was part of the calculation.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.700]   - I know that's deep, and I know that's,
[01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:13.340]   oh God, I hate myself right now,
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:19.760]   but Cus, he knew he was getting out free.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:26.100]   He knew he was gonna not have to be there.
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:27.940]   He was getting off easy.
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:30.300]   Oh, Teddy, how do you say someone's gonna be dead?
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:31.660]   They're getting off easy.
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:34.620]   Well, I'll say it again in case you didn't hear me, all right?
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:39.620]   He was gonna get off easy and not have to face
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:43.340]   where he came up short, because he did his job,
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:46.140]   because he put forward the greatest fight of all time,
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:47.500]   and you guys screwed it up,
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:50.060]   and he knew that that might happen,
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.460]   but you guys screwed it up,
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:55.780]   and whatever, that's your fault, that's on,
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:57.780]   I'll tell you, Tyson would be mad at this,
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:59.280]   but that's on Tyson.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.900]   How can you say that, Teddy?
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:03.180]   He loved me.
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:05.020]   I'm not saying he didn't love you,
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.500]   but he loved some other stuff too,
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:10.140]   and I don't know if Tyson could ever come
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:14.600]   to grips light with that, and it's not his job to,
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:18.500]   but it's my job not to hide from it.
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.300]   I know Cus in dimensions that other people
[01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:22.940]   just only think they know.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:23.780]   - Did Cus know?
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:25.680]   Did Cus know this about himself?
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:30.300]   Did he reflect, did he introspect?
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:32.100]   - Oh, he sent a message to me.
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:33.340]   Cus sent a guide to me.
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:35.300]   My wife was pregnant.
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.380]   We were living in an apartment in Catskill
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:38.540]   on Cortiskill Road.
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.300]   We went through all this,
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:44.540]   and I was getting ready to move to Staten Island,
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:47.940]   and we still were there for a little while,
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:50.440]   before we did, after all this went down.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:56.300]   He sent a guide to me, to the house,
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:59.100]   secret, whatever you wanna call it, my wife, me,
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:02.900]   so I listened to him.
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.900]   Cus said, "If you leave, I'm a messenger,"
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:09.260]   you know, whatever, "If you leave,"
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:14.340]   this was in the aftermath of what,
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:16.380]   the gun, the whole thing.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:19.380]   You gotta remember, Tice was a ward of the state.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:20.980]   He was put in Cus' custody.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:24.460]   Cus was looking to adopt him, for obvious reasons,
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:26.600]   so he had control, and he loved him.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:30.580]   How dare I say anything less?
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:33.660]   I won't, but it made sense, too.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:36.300]   But he was a ward of the state still.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.980]   Do you know what that means?
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:42.460]   There's rules, means the state's still overlooking it.
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:44.220]   If he ain't living the right life,
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:49.660]   you gotta remember, he came out of a jail,
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:54.420]   so reform school, but if he ain't living the right life,
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:56.500]   he could be taken away from Cus.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.860]   What's not living the right life?
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:59.500]   Well, he wasn't in school no more.
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:00.800]   They didn't know about it.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:04.140]   He had some things that were going on.
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:06.260]   We won't get into that right now,
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:08.420]   in school and different things, whatever.
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:11.460]   And he had a strainer put a gun to his head.
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.460]   That ain't so good.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:15.960]   If a report came back to them that that happened,
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:18.700]   he would've been taken away from Cus.
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:21.180]   That couldn't happen.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:23.020]   Look, nobody knows this.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:26.320]   I talk about it a little bit, but never probably,
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.340]   because why would I?
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:29.740]   I don't know, why am I doing it now?
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:32.340]   I don't know, because, I don't know.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:33.780]   Because I am, because it's now.
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:35.180]   Because it's now, maybe.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:37.780]   Maybe because it's now, I don't know.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:42.780]   So he sent this man that obviously we both knew,
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:46.780]   and he said, here's the deal, Teddy.
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:51.260]   If no talk about this, wants it to disappear basically,
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:56.260]   you leave, and he will give you 5% of his word.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:57.100]   Can you imagine?
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:01.260]   He will give you 5% of Tyson's earnings
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:02.600]   for the rest of his career.
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:06.540]   And, but I don't regret it one bit,
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:07.780]   because it wouldn't have happened anyway.
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.940]   See, that's where I can be honest with my,
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:12.220]   people say, oh, he's a stand-up guy,
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.580]   because I told him to shove it with a, you know,
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:20.460]   in that place, and tell Cus to shove it
[01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:22.660]   in that freaking place, you know, I was mad.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:25.500]   Teddy, Teddy, don't get angry.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:26.860]   Don't get angry?
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:28.580]   Are you out of, are you serious?
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:29.940]   Get out of here.
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:31.340]   Tell him to go shove it over.
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:36.580]   And, you know, my wife was like, huh, but,
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:39.300]   and then people like, why didn't you take the deal?
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.620]   It wasn't a deal.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:45.620]   It was an escape clause for Cus.
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:50.380]   It was, it was an insurance policy that his,
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:52.900]   you know, that this kid wouldn't be taken away from.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:54.740]   And thank God he wasn't.
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:56.220]   I wasn't gonna go and say nothing.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.380]   They didn't have to worry about, Cus forgot who I was.
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:02.260]   Cus forgot why he went to court for me.
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:04.740]   Because of those, because of those characteristics
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:07.340]   that he said he loved, and he noticed,
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:08.940]   and then that he admired.
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:11.100]   I didn't lose those characters.
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:12.940]   He forgot that that was me.
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:15.020]   He forgot who he was talking to.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:16.860]   He didn't have to do that.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:20.420]   How about, that's why I told him to shove it up his ass.
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.780]   Not because of the other insult.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.620]   - Yeah.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.940]   - And then, and then when people said to me,
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:27.220]   oh, you were stand-up.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:28.820]   Because it was around a little bit.
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:30.740]   It was around in the circles.
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.860]   And then when people, oh, stand-up Teddy.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:35.580]   He didn't care about the money.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:38.300]   I said, stand-up Teddy, what are you talking about?
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.620]   How about, how about just realistic Teddy?
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.700]   How about I live in a real world
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:45.380]   that I was never gonna get that money?
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.460]   So I'm saying, I'm standing up to something
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.180]   that I knew never existed.
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:50.660]   So I ain't stand-up.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:51.780]   Not in that way.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:53.380]   I am in other ways maybe.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:56.820]   But not, don't put a metal on my chest for that.
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:59.140]   Because that never existed.
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:57:59.980]   - Yeah.
[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:01.860]   - It was never meant to exist.
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:03.260]   But he didn't even understand.
[01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:07.340]   That was the one thing that really disappointed me in Cuss.
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:11.700]   I was like, Cuss, you really allowed this to get to you.
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:16.700]   Where you've allowed it to really fog up your thinking
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:20.660]   to the point where you're smarter than that.
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.660]   You're better than that.
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:26.900]   That you would actually think you got a freaking offer me
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:30.900]   a freaking pieces of silver?
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:31.740]   - Yeah.
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:34.820]   - You really think that, that's what you, freak you.
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:37.820]   Like, all that you told me that you love me
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:41.740]   and that we were, I was the young master and all this.
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:44.160]   And you think you were gonna buy me?
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:48.580]   And I was gonna, and that was gonna keep me quiet?
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:49.900]   How about I would keep quiet
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:51.820]   because I would always keep quiet?
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:55.360]   - So he thought maybe you might betray him.
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.100]   - Isn't that interesting, yeah.
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:01.460]   And why did he think that?
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:03.400]   No, no, really.
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.380]   - Fear.
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:07.300]   - Yeah, but yeah, fear is at the essence of everything.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:08.780]   It's connected with everything.
[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:11.140]   Fear of losing what he was gonna lose.
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.500]   But it was more than fear.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:15.680]   It was him not believing in the things
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:17.180]   that he told me he believed in.
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.320]   He didn't even know that.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:26.100]   He believed in me because I was this stand-up guy
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:28.100]   because I didn't sell myself.
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:31.640]   Because I didn't freaking turn evidence.
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.940]   I didn't make a deal.
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:35.460]   And that's why he went to court.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.700]   That's why he stood up for me.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.300]   And I appreciate it.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:39.620]   And that was what he lived by.
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:43.040]   And that was his, those were the blocks of being a man.
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:46.540]   It was so much for those blocks.
[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:51.780]   - Well, it's like you said, loyalty requires,
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:57.260]   he would've had to take a risk on losing immortality
[01:59:57.260 --> 02:00:01.900]   that he would achieve by creating a great heavyweight champion.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:03.260]   - 100%.
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:05.300]   But the only way you ever find out
[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:09.820]   if somebody is worthy of that is to test.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:10.660]   And it was Cus.
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:12.780]   - This is Shakespearean, you know.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:13.620]   This story.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:15.820]   - Cus told me, Cus said,
[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:18.140]   and it does come in different forms.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:19.620]   - Yeah.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:20.820]   - I said, all right, Cus.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.340]   - This was his test.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:25.260]   And some people pass this test
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.220]   because they're able to pass that test
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.140]   because it's not really a test.
[02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:32.820]   Not for them, because it doesn't speak to their weakness.
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:35.740]   But it's the test that speaks to the weakness.
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:37.000]   That's the one.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.020]   So this one, I get it.
[02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:42.460]   I get what it spoke to, Cus.
[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:43.300]   And you know what?
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:45.100]   At the end of the day, I forgive you.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.460]   And I feel bad for you.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:53.220]   I feel bad that you were put in that position
[02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:55.300]   after you lived your life that way
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.100]   and that you taught that
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:01.020]   and you preached that from the mountaintops,
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:02.820]   that you had to be,
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:09.660]   that you had to be,
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:13.820]   I'm not gonna use the word,
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:18.820]   but that you had to fail yourself
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:22.660]   and that you had to somehow know that before you died.
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:25.260]   I just pray that you didn't know that.
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:28.340]   And you still don't know that because you were great.
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:29.220]   You were great.
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:33.620]   And you've given me some,
[02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:43.380]   you know, you've given me something to aspire towards,
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:48.860]   to try to be less weak.
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:51.100]   Try to be better.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:58.460]   And try to be as good as you want it to be.
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:02.100]   I wish I can someday.
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:06.620]   More importantly, I wish I could make my father,
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:10.980]   you know, feel,
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:14.220]   just feel good up there.
[02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:19.980]   - You're a grandfather now.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:21.660]   - Yeah, four grandchildren.
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:25.460]   - What, if you could give them advice
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:29.540]   on how to live a life they can be proud of.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:33.860]   - Just,
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:40.540]   do everything you can
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:44.820]   to the best of your ability every day
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:48.180]   to like yourself.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:54.340]   To give yourself a reason to actually say,
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:57.140]   "I'd like to be friends with that guy."
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:59.340]   - Is loyalty one of the reasons,
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:03.580]   one of the things to aspire to?
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:11.060]   - Loyalty is your chance to have a fulfilled life.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:17.380]   Loyalty is your chance to have strength,
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:21.540]   to have all the things you need to have a good life,
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:24.660]   to be a good parent, be a good husband,
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:26.780]   be a good grandfather.
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:29.420]   Hopefully be a good role model.
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:34.260]   Loyalty is,
[02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:43.300]   loyalty is if you could find something to drink,
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:48.860]   to take into your body,
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:53.180]   to make you prepared for life,
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:55.580]   to be all the things that you wanna be,
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:59.060]   to be strong enough to be those things.
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:01.220]   Loyalty would be the thing you would drink.
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:04.660]   And when I say loyal,
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:09.500]   I mean unequivocally, I mean unconditionally,
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:12.420]   not conveniently.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:13.780]   Obviously, you know that.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:18.900]   If you could be loyal, you could be a good person.
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:19.820]   You could be a person
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:22.660]   that you would actually like to be around
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:25.180]   because you could be a person you could rely on.
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:28.660]   And I think that's one of the greatest assets
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:30.140]   that a human being can have.
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:34.140]   - And what do you do when you're betrayed?
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:35.340]   How do you overcome that?
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:40.260]   - You think of what you learned from it.
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:44.740]   Use it as a roadmap
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:52.420]   to remember and to think back of how you got there
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:58.020]   and how you got to the place where you got betrayed
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:00.020]   and how that person got to that place.
[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:03.300]   Try to remember that in your own journey.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:07.020]   - Has it, for you, made you cynical?
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.900]   Like how do you take the leap of trust
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:14.900]   towards people again and again after that?
[02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:16.740]   - Just by remembering that I'm still trying
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:21.740]   to forgive myself for the things that I came up short with.
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:24.700]   And if I haven't figured that out yet,
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:30.780]   it's probably okay to say
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:35.380]   they didn't figure it out yet.
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:36.340]   They didn't get it.
[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:38.660]   They didn't figure it out.
[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:40.140]   And if I couldn't figure it out
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:42.020]   and I'm still trying to figure it out,
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:49.060]   maybe I could get over that initial stabbing
[02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:51.580]   of what it feels like.
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:53.380]   It does feel kind of like a stabbing
[02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:56.940]   that you feel when you're betrayed initially
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:01.940]   and that you could only think of anger, revenge, hatred.
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:06.780]   And those things, I'm not proud of that,
[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:11.420]   but I felt all those things, you know?
[02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:13.820]   And I still feel them sometimes.
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:15.300]   And then I go back and say,
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:17.740]   "Hey, you're still working at forgiving yourself
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:19.300]   "for some things.
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:20.860]   "Try to remember that, kid."
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:24.780]   Memory's an important thing.
[02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:28.700]   Forgetfulness is pretty important too.
[02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:32.300]   And try to remember why we forget.
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:35.580]   Why do we forget?
[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:38.620]   Because it wasn't something you felt proud of.
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:43.980]   - You think about your death?
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:45.020]   Are you afraid of it?
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:48.180]   - You know, it's funny you ask that.
[02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:49.740]   I never used to think about it.
[02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:58.620]   I know people in both places, you know?
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:06:59.460]   - I know.
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:00.300]   You got it covered.
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:02.140]   (laughing)
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:03.260]   You're gonna be all right.
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:04.420]   - Don't forget that.
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:06.020]   I know people in both places.
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:09.180]   (laughing)
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:10.220]   - Both neighborhoods.
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:27.500]   I've been given credit for being brave
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.300]   in certain spots in life.
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:35.300]   I hope I can be brave when it comes time to leave life.
[02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:40.900]   I hope I can be, you know?
[02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:45.900]   And that's as real and honest as you can be about it.
[02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:48.740]   I hope I can be, you know?
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:50.420]   So far so good.
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:53.780]   You know, when I've had to be certain things
[02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:56.540]   that I was scared to freaking death,
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:01.980]   I found a way to be them, for the most part.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:06.980]   And so, I figure when that day comes,
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:12.260]   I'll figure that out, too.
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:13.540]   - It's gonna be another test.
[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:14.540]   Maybe the last one.
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:19.300]   Teddy, it's a huge honor to talk to you.
[02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:20.380]   - It's my pleasure.
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:22.260]   - Thank you for being the human you are,
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:25.660]   for being honest, honest about the full range
[02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:29.500]   of human nature, and thank you for talking today.
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:30.340]   - Thank you.
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:34.580]   Thank you for having me, and thanks for listening.
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:36.980]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:38.220]   with Teddy Atlas.
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:39.340]   To support this podcast,
[02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:41.980]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:45.740]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali.
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:49.300]   I hated every minute of training,
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.460]   but I said, "Don't quit.
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:56.460]   "Suffer now, and live the rest of your life as a champion."
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:59.860]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.440]   (upbeat music)
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:05.020]   (upbeat music)
