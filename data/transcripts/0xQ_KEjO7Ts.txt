[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940]   Yesterday the world witnessed Charlie Kirk die.
[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.220]   But when I posted on my Instagram story and I'm like, rest in peace, Charlie.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.880]   I don't watch the guy's content, but nobody deserves to die like this.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.520]   You should have seen the DMs and the reactions that I got from people that were like, F him.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.700]   I'm glad he's dead.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.760]   LMAO, I'm going to be spitting on his grave.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.780]   The amount of hateful messages that I saw, that was what was disheartening to me.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.120]   I just, I feel like it's awful, man, that anybody gets taken out.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.620]   And that wives get left behind, kids get left behind, and that people get murdered publicly.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.480]   Things happen all the time.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.500]   We live in a sinful world.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.160]   There's going to be really tragic things that happen.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.480]   But the public reaction to this, to me, is like what's really concerning.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.960]   Because it even makes anybody who wants to speak their mind a little hesitant.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.620]   There's people dying because they think different than you.
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.420]   And that, to me, is like a crazy place to be in.
