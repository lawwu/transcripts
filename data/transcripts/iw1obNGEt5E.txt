[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   A couple of days ago, I got a chance to do the Joe Rogan experience for the fifth time,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.080]   but first time in the new Texas studio.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   I also got a chance to interview him afterwards for the podcast that I host and ask him all
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.240]   the usual philosophical, over-romanticized Russian questions that I usually do on the
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240]   podcast.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.200]   A bunch of people messaged me asking, "So how's the new studio?"
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.400]   So instead of responding to everybody individually, I thought I'd make this video to give my thoughts
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840]   on the new Joe Rogan Austin, Texas studio.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.720]   There's a few quick points I want to make, but overall, TL;DR is I love it.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.160]   So first let me say from the perspective of a guest and what the studio actually looks
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.960]   like in real life, I think it looks great in real life.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.760]   And I believe it's an improvement over the previous studio in several ways.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.600]   So one, the previous studio actually has a lot of extra space that feels useless.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.800]   And there's something about removing that space that makes the studio feel more intimate.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.680]   I definitely felt like I was pulled into the conversation more.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.840]   Like if we take somebody like Larry King from CNN, check him out, look into it, is he has
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.280]   this like creepy closeness to the guests.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.620]   I think this new studio actually extracts a really nice balance.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.760]   To me, that's interesting as a podcaster.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.780]   And that's something I talked to Joe with is how do you create an atmosphere where you
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.160]   just forget that the rest of the world exists and you lose yourself in the conversation
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.600]   where you're really focused in on listening and thinking about what the other person is
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.240]   saying.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.880]   Another small thing that I think is actually really cool from a guest perspective is there's
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.100]   only now one big TV versus two TVs.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.880]   So when you're looking at something in the previous studio, the one chimp was looking
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.920]   at one TV and the other chimp was looking at the other TV.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.940]   And if you know anything about chimps or dogs or humans, there's a powerful signaling thing
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.440]   with our eyes when we're both looking at the same thing.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.140]   There's like a more of a bond to it when we're looking at the same thing, same object or
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.460]   like same image on the TV.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.720]   So there is just nicer experience to be able to look at the same thing together and then
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.160]   look back and also from a camera perspective, you can see what everyone is looking at, whether
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.440]   it's two people or three people or four people.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.440]   So I personally love it.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.360]   Now from the perspective of what the video actually looks like, that goes into lighting,
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.320]   camera positions, also the texture of the background.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.920]   So when the camera is doing the autofocusing or adjusting the lights, it does a good job,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   all of that.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.200]   Now to comment on that part, I want to say how amazing Jamie is.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.040]   For people who don't know, Jamie Varner is the, I guess, producer of the Joe Rogan Experience,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.760]   but he also does a million other things.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.840]   He's just the creative mind of his own, a photographer, just a creator of all kinds.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.080]   Now me again as a podcaster, I do many of the things that Jamie does, but I do it much
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   worse.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.720]   So I get to really appreciate the quality of his work.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.080]   So much of the setup, the wires, the configuration of the audio and the video and the management
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.680]   of that, the switching of the cameras, the ability to Google, all of that comes together
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.360]   as a vision and implementation by Jamie.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.880]   And so this new studio from a video and audio engineering perspective is very much a creation
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.200]   of Jamie.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.100]   And I'm telling you now, he's done a masterful job and is quickly improving.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.480]   So just like he did with a previous studio to be constantly quickly improving until it
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.980]   got to that level there everybody got used to.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.480]   He's doing the same thing here.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.240]   I guarantee you'll be at a stellar level very quickly.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.080]   The previous times on the show, I knew how good he was, but this time I actually got
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   a chance to chat with him offline about some of the details of all the stuff he's doing.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.760]   And it just took my respect for him to another level.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   And hopefully I'll convince him, he kind of said yes, to come on the podcast so we can
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.280]   talk about some of the genius behind young Jamie.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   And also I want to say that to me as a podcaster and an aspiring young Jamie myself, it was
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:25.400]   really nice to see how humble and self-critical he is, given all the success of the show,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.920]   given everything that's been done, given so few screw ups, so few imperfections, given
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   the level at which he's able to with one hand be a solo producer of an entire video podcast
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.640]   where he's switching the cameras, and with another hand be able to Google at a moment's
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.720]   notice.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.920]   Given all that, he's extremely self-critical, extremely humble.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.860]   That's just inspiring to me because it echoes to the way I see the world as well.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.780]   So it gives me hope that if I continue seeing the world that way, I'll be able to eventually
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.640]   figure out how to do this podcasting and engineering thing the right way.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.100]   So for whatever it's worth, I love it.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.080]   The video will keep improving.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.360]   And I think just like the Cybertruck, which will likely be manufactured in the same city
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.600]   of Austin, Texas, I think people will eventually see it not as ugly as they did at first, but
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.360]   as badass.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.200]   And also, as I mentioned to him on the show, Spotify is better than YouTube in terms of
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.160]   music.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.360]   I hope that next time I take a ride in that spaceship, I'd love to do a cover of Voodoo
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.080]   Child by Jimi Hendrix.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.760]   All right, check out the conversation with Joe.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.960]   It should come out next week.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   Hopefully I didn't say anything ridiculous, but I probably did.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   Love you all.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.440]   I'll see you next time.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.940]   Bye.
