[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   Hey, everybody, welcome to the world's greatest podcast. With
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.180]   me again, the world's number one podcast. Yes, the world's
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.880]   number one podcast. We came in eighth last week, I think for
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.040]   those of you looking at the iTunes rankings, which is
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.760]   absurd. We've only got to be number eight across all of
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.520]   Apple. Something like that. Yeah, whatever their top
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.880]   episodes are on the weekends. Well, that means we crushed on
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.160]   Spotify, then. Probably Yeah, I would guess. I don't I don't
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.320]   know all the rankings, but and and I guess on YouTube, we got
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.400]   labeled with some COVID thing magic. I mean, it's what's going
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.080]   on at YouTube a joke, like literally you're labeling COVID
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.240]   at this point. I mean, what a joke. Oh, my lord.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.920]   So I guess we have to at the top of the show talk about the
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.840]   fundraiser. And I guess this like Vinod Khosla came in hot
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.600]   this week and attacked the besties. Let's play the clip.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520]   What is your sense of the shifting winds in the valley
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   around politics? I think for a very long time, the valley was
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.480]   seen as sort of a liberal bastion. But you know, if you
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.320]   listen to Elon Musk, or you listen to all in podcast and
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.560]   that gang and others, it seems to be shifting potentially
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.120]   towards former President Trump. Is that just a small pocket? Or
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.680]   do you think that that's a real shift in terms of the way the
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.880]   valley's thinking politically?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.160]   The first thing I would say is all in podcast, and some of the
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.080]   supporters there are not based in the valley. I would say
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.640]   there's a bunch of MAGA extremists in every part of
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.720]   society. And I hope we can prevent them from destroying
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.160]   democracy, which is probably the most important issue we face.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.000]   All right, snacks. Why are you destroying democracy?
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.480]   Now that's a good fit.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:14.640]   All right, David. If I know was at the conference, he got a
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.000]   little chippy here. Maybe he got a little bit out of line. He's a
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.640]   little bit out of line. What's your take? A little bit a little
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   bit? A little bit? Well, first of all, Vinod should realize
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.600]   we're not MAGA extremists or extremists of any sort, because
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.680]   he's at all in summit last year. He was great. Yeah, we like what
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.360]   he had to say productive. I certainly don't dispute his
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.320]   expertise and track record in tech. But in addition to that,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.160]   then he's saying that we're not based in Silicon Valley. We're
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.080]   not from Silicon Valley. We've all been here for decades. And
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.240]   then he doubled down on that in the tweet. So that's a bizarre
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.720]   statement. Maybe he thinks he gets to define people in or out
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.360]   of Silicon Valley. I don't really understand it. But to be
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.640]   frank, this is one of a series of statements that he's made
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.560]   recently that I can only call insulting and childish. First,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.920]   he had this tweet that he said that Trump supporters were
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.640]   lacking in empathy and caring. Then he had another tweet where
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.920]   he said that Trump supporters weren't teaching good values to
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.480]   their kids. This cause Sean McGuire, who's a partner in
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.440]   Sequoia to quote tweet him saying that I think that I'd
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.680]   rather raise my kids to grow up to take after Ivanka Trump than
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.800]   100 Biden. Yeah, and that got like something like 20,000 likes
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.880]   and it was one of those brutal ratios I've ever seen on a
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.600]   tweet. So in any event, I mean, this is just one in a series of
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.960]   partisan tweets. And look, I think you can take whatever
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.440]   position you want on a political candidate. I can understand. If
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.720]   he doesn't like Trump, a lot of people don't. He's raising money
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.320]   for Biden. That's fine. doesn't bother me at all. fundraiser like
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.120]   two weeks ago or something. Exactly. That's not an issue at
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.920]   all. But what I do take offense at is labeling millions and
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.720]   millions of ordinary Americans as somehow lacking in empathy,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.000]   lacking in caring, not being good parents, because you don't
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.560]   like their support for Trump. Yeah. And I think that that that
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.040]   is a statement that frankly, reeks of being cocooned in an
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   elite bubble for way too long. And let me just explain, if you
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.320]   look at where Trump support is strongest, it's really in Middle
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.440]   America in sort of the heartland of America of what in between
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.760]   the elite states, basically, the part of America that coastal
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.840]   least dismissively refer to as flyover country. Sure. And it's
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.600]   a lot of the industrial Midwest. And frankly, that part of the
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.960]   country has not had the same type of economic experience that
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.440]   we've had in Silicon Valley. Of course, they have not been
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.880]   beneficiaries of globalization, or equities, you know, and
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.640]   they're, they're in the working class and then working class in
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.240]   the factories got gutted. Yeah, that's it. Well, yeah, look, if
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.320]   you're in one of the handful of export industries in America,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.760]   and I'm talking about if you're in Hollywood, or you're in big
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.320]   finance, or you're in software, then globalization has been
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.720]   great for you. Because it has created huge global markets for
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.220]   our products. However, if you're in an industry that has to
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.640]   compete with global exports, then it's been very bad with
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.280]   you. And blue collar workers have been hurt, labor has been
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.880]   hurt, people who work with their hands have been hurt. They have
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.120]   not benefited in the same way from the system that we've had
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.080]   in this country for the last 30 years. So you can understand why
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.440]   they would not be so enchanted with elite thinking. And I think
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.320]   to then label those people as lacking and caring or empathy or
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.680]   not being good parents, because they haven't had they haven't
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.520]   had the same economic ride that you've had for the last 30
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.840]   years. And then you it's a blind spot. You are the one who is
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.920]   fighting a legal battle to kick some of those people the public
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.760]   the surfers,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.680]   kick the public off of the public beach in front of your
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.160]   beach house. And then you're saying they're the ones lacking
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.560]   in empathy. Dude, look in the mirror. Yeah, I mean, listen,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.080]   the great irony of this is, as you know, the Democrats were
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.720]   supposed to be the the party of the working people and Biden was
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.400]   supposed to be the pinnacle of that, like fighting for unions
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.440]   fighting for the working person. And so they've just lost that
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.200]   whole thing. And
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.480]   I'll say like, it feels like a lot of people are tilted,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.320]   because they defeated Trump, and now he's back. And so that tilts
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.800]   a lot of people like there was a lot of effort, a lot of energy,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.080]   and a feeling of success, that Trump was ousted. And the fact
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.360]   that the guy is now the front runner to be president again,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.440]   can be very tilting after feeling like you've already won
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.280]   the battle. And guess what, it's back. I will also defend Vinod
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.360]   real quick. I'll say, having known Vinod for a long time,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.280]   he's an investor with me. He's a guy I've come to appreciate and
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.080]   think highly of. We had him at the summit. He was great at the
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.320]   summit. It was great. This was awesome. If you listen to his
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.680]   thing, he said, the listeners of the pod, and then he said,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.840]   MAGA extremist, so they're not based in Silicon Valley. I think
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.120]   he was referencing that the listeners of the pod are not
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.280]   based in Silicon Valley, and they are mad. Yeah, I couldn't
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.440]   hear. I think what he meant to say was, and some of the
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.920]   supporters there are not based in Silicon Valley, meaning like
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.680]   the supporters,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.280]   to mouth your thoughts on the notes comments.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.000]   Yeah, I think the notes comments are a microcosm of something
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.920]   that's a little bit bigger than just him, and I think is roughly
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.720]   emblematic of the mainstream media, which is, I think the
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.640]   four of us have found over the course of these last four years
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.800]   doing the podcast, a rhythm, where there's a whole diversity
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.960]   of views. We've always respected each other, we've learned from
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.440]   each other. And each of us have taken turns, expressing
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.680]   something that the others have ended up converging on. That's
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.520]   not a holistic statement on every issue, but it has it has
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.600]   happened. And that's a an incredible example of how you
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.240]   should figure things out from first principles, especially
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.320]   things that matter. And I think this is the first time and you
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   know, look, David said this a few years ago, he said, sax did
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.680]   that, the course of elections will be driven by podcasts. And
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.920]   I didn't give that a full enough waiting at the moment when he
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.040]   said it. But I think what I'm realizing is it's not
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.840]   necessarily just that podcasts will frame elections, but it's
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.320]   the counterfactual, which is that it fills a vacuum. And I
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.400]   think what you're seeing right now are the reactions of people
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.080]   that have thrived in what used to work, which was a traditional
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.920]   media infrastructure that would shape how people were supposed
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.120]   to think. But then all of a sudden, if you can have a
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.160]   platform like this, where people just talk from first
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.880]   principles, respectfully, and then the chips are going to be
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.120]   what it is, you know, people will come to their own
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.040]   conclusions. I think that that's what people are reacting to. So
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.720]   I think what the note is reacting to is this sort of
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   discomfort where you see for reasonable, intelligent people
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.080]   all of a sudden talk open mindedly about what's happening
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.320]   in the presidential election. And what you leave out is the
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.800]   planted orthodoxy of what you're supposed to think. And that's
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.240]   disconcerting to him. It's just disconcerting and confusing
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.800]   maybe to Sorkin, who I think is a wonderful reporter and a
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.520]   thinker. It's disconcerting Jason to every single media
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.560]   outlet over the last week that's breathlessly been trying to get
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.440]   me or sacks to have an opinion on this. And the reason I've
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.880]   deleted all of these emails is they don't get a chance to frame
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.880]   what we think. You can listen to the podcast and know what we
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.920]   think. This is the future of how smart, reasonable, moderate
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.640]   people should make decisions. It is an example. Talking to
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.840]   somebody you disagree with does not make your opinion
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.320]   bastardized. It actually makes your opinion valuable. There are
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   these simple truths to living a productive life that if you want
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.160]   to embrace, you need to find friends that you can trust even
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.800]   on issues when you disagree, you can hear them out. So that's
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   what's happening right now. And I think that that's why we all
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.040]   need to sort of stand together and lock in arms and just keep
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.720]   moving forward. It is something really important here that's
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.960]   happening. And I think that's why the media and these opinion
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.040]   makers are losing their minds.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.560]   Freiburg, your thoughts on this. You're friends with Vinod, as
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.800]   you mentioned, and you've always said to me and in our personal
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.440]   discussions that the reason you do this pod is because you
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.520]   really want to set an example of how to have great conversations
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.200]   and learn from each other and, and the tone of what we do here.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.480]   So your thoughts on this,
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.720]   the unfortunate reality in a voting system and election cycle
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.440]   like we're in Vinod went and did a fundraiser, it's public, but he
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.560]   did a fundraiser for Biden a few weeks ago. And he wants to win
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.360]   the election, he wants to make his horse win. There's a lot of
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.840]   reasons why I'm sure Vinod has chosen that person to be his
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.840]   horse. And so when you get on the playing field, you got two
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.360]   teams, only one team wins. So you know, everyone pulls out all
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.080]   the stops to win. One of the things that is done is
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.920]   unfortunate, and it over time causes an erosion and a
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.520]   hardening into a kind of polarity between all people,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.960]   which is that you call the other side, wrong or bad or extreme,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.720]   the term that he used, which really, I think, personifies the
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.400]   problem is he said their listeners are there are MAGA
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.520]   extremists,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.560]   extremist being the word, right? Magazine needs to make America
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.680]   great again, which I think everybody wants to make America
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.560]   great again, whatever the extremism phrase is used by both
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.480]   parties to describe the points of view of the other side. And
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.440]   what I think is lacking is a reshifting of the perspective to
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.080]   say their views are valid. I acknowledge their views, I hear
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.600]   them, I know why they feel that way. I'm understanding where
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   that group of people are coming from. And to have that
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.240]   acknowledgement, unfortunately, softens and weakens your
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.400]   position and ability to go out and win election. And so both
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.000]   sides harden themselves and use terms like this, to try and
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   discredit the other side. So it's unfortunate to see, I think
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.920]   we all understand where someone who's trying to win a battle on
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.480]   the field is coming from when they're trying to do this. But I
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.840]   do think that what is deeply lacking in the erosion that's
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.600]   arisen is because we can't say, I hear you, I see the problems.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.560]   I recognize you as people just like us. You have kids, your
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.440]   families. And you have a different point of view on the
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.840]   policies that will work and the individual that will realize
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.560]   those policies.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.000]   I also think it's important to make sure that we reiterate
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.320]   again, at the sake of being pedantic, the facts, which is
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.840]   this is a nonpartisan show. And it is a platform that has
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.320]   showcased and given time to Democrats, and Republicans and
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.120]   independent independents. Yeah. And they've all taken us up on
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.400]   it. So that thought by the note is, at best incomplete, and more
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.000]   appropriately, just stupid and factually wrong.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.320]   This is a good point. Larry Summers spoke at the same
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.160]   conference that
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.360]   the note Larry Summers, Dean Phillips, Bobby Kennedy, Chris
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.520]   Christie, I mean, this is a spectrum of people that we are
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.880]   bringing on. Again,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.240]   Cheryl, Sam, you can hear from Jared Kushner, Jared Kushner,
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.200]   you can hear from them in an unfiltered way and come to your
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.280]   own conclusion. That's why we were number eight last week.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.200]   That's the exact reason why. And I think that that's very scary.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.680]   Because instead of power brokers, being able to filter
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.120]   an opinion, you now have an opportunity to just hear it for
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.840]   yourself, discuss it amongst your friends and come to your
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.680]   own conclusion. So we have always been bipartisan here. And
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.920]   we will continue to be bipartisan. The second thing is,
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.080]   and I just want to say this again, I have asked the White
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.840]   House for President Biden to come on the show.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.760]   Oh, come on the show, please. Yeah.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.000]   Yeah, we've offered the exact same thing.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.480]   We are just we are just waiting. People really don't want me to
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.800]   be friends with you guys. They want me to end my friendship
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.520]   with you tomorrow. They want me to end my friendship with you
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.440]   sacks like, like, and these are people who are our mutuals, I
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.760]   just want to say, and I want to just tell them all equally to go
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.080]   fuck themselves here. You can believe out the F word. Like I'm
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.720]   not picking my friends based on their political parties or their
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.920]   leanings or who they're supporting for president. The
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.160]   way I look at this sacks is at this point, we're all Americans.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.080]   We're in this together. America survive survive Trump's
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.520]   presidency, America is going to survive Biden's presidency, the
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.040]   democratic process, it is very messy. Everybody gets to have a
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.760]   voice. And let's just pause for a second here and open up the
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.880]   aperture. Let's be thankful that everybody gets to have a say.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.240]   Let's keep it from getting personal. Half the humans on
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.480]   this planet Earth do not have a voice. The one thing that's
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.200]   trending in the wrong direction globally is people living in a
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.360]   democracy. It's the one thing not getting better. We have a
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.040]   lot of work to do in this country. We have to respect each
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.440]   other like we try to do here on this podcast. And we have to
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.080]   talk about the important issues. We all agree the budget's out of
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.000]   control. We all agree the education system sucks. We live
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.800]   in a multipolar world. We have to figure that out. When we
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.240]   should go to war when we shouldn't, when we need to stay
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.960]   out of things. These are complicated issues. And name
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.240]   calling and this presidency is not as important as tackling
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.480]   these issues together as Americans. I hope everybody can
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.200]   keep that in mind. So let's debate this. May the best
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.880]   candidate win. And then let's move on and solve some problems
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.840]   here. Okay, and it's getting very personal. Yeah. Well said
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.440]   really well said. I know I'm really hurt by this because I
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.800]   tell you personally, it's very hurtful to me because I value
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.000]   our friendships and they're picking on the wrong guy because
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.760]   you're the most loyal guy. And so it's kind of like it's going
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.800]   to be the least effective because you don't care what they
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.560]   think Jake, that's the problem. So they can get to you. You can
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.240]   ask me if I do that. Don't tell me what I think sex you can ask
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.520]   me. Okay. I actually care about the two of you bigger like
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.120]   brothers. No, we do. But I know I just have to retrain sacks that
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.480]   he can't tell me what I think. Yeah, no, because you do that.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.640]   You put words in my mouth for all listeners. I just want you
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.720]   to know they've been bickering like this for 20 years. So it's
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.320]   yeah. No, here's the point. Here's the point. It happens
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.800]   even worse offline. We're not offline. It's unbelievable.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.280]   Stop. You're ruining it. Jake out. You're just running right
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.680]   now. Here's the thing. I respect, you know, all of my
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.240]   friends and I like having a diversity of opinions that makes
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.160]   life more interesting for me. And then to tell me I can't be
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.520]   friends with this person, that person, the way I grew up, my
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.360]   dad had a bar, Hells Angels, cops, firefighters, just
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.080]   everybody was allowed to come and hang out at the bar. Like
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.880]   we're here. We're having a discourse. Everybody's welcome
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.640]   for a seat at the table. You don't LGBTQ, but they all of
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.160]   them the entire rainbow.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.500]   What people haven't figured out yet is like cancel culture is
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.160]   over. virtue signaling is over.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.200]   Absolutely. de is over.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.240]   It's off trend, not on trend. And the people who are still
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.720]   tweeting these blanket statements, and they're trying
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.920]   to demonize the entire other side with unfactual, unfounded
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.840]   potshots are just making fools of themselves. And you can see
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.320]   that in there. You can see that in the reaction on x.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.680]   All right, let's move on.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.920]   And we have some breaking news here. Oh, no, just to put things
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.840]   on a happier note.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.120]   What happened? Did Uber get bought by Tesla just launched
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.120]   the Tesla mezcal? Oh, breaking news story. Hold on.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.880]   It's a breaking news story. Tesla has launched mezcal.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.640]   In that beautiful lightning bottle. I just ordered my bottle
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.200]   of this like seconds ago while we're doing the show. Because
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.680]   this sold out in like two hours before and now the the bottles
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.380]   of the original Tesla tequila go for like $2,000. Now, okay,
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.480]   breaking news. Get yours. Get yours. Now if it's still
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.240]   smoking mezcal. There you go. Wait a second. Is this going to
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.440]   compete with the all in a little bit?
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   Well, sold out by the time we launch our ball. Both can be
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.920]   sold out. We're both going to be selling that everybody can see
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.520]   that everybody can win. It's not a zero sum game. Everybody can
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.560]   secure the bag. All right, let's get into the docket enough of
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.200]   the self referential influencers. Now did you guys
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.640]   see my deck this month? We're all influencers. We're all
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.040]   influencers. Absolutely. Absolutely. There's a lot of
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.680]   federal regulation going on around AI as we know, regulatory
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.800]   capture. Shout out to our guy Bill Gurley, who did a great
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.920]   talk last year about this. On Wednesday, the New York Times
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.520]   reported that the DOJ and the FTC had struck a deal on how to
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.840]   go after AI incumbents. Here's the terms of the deal. And
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.640]   again, this is all breaking. The DOJ gets to investigate
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   whether NVIDIA violated antitrust laws, they didn't
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.600]   specify what they're going after here. But it could include the
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.000]   NVIDIA use of CUDA software to lock customers into using their
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.240]   GPUs, or maybe how NVIDIA distributes their GPUs to
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.600]   customers. There's a lot of regulation around that. And the
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.560]   FTC takes the lead on looking into open AI's conduct and
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.520]   Microsoft's AI deals. Obviously, there's been a ton of those,
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.680]   including acquirers, etc. And then just this morning, the Wall
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.360]   Street Journal reported that the FTC had opened a probe into
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.000]   Microsoft's deal with inflection AI. That's the one if you
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.960]   remember, where they bought the staff and then did some fakaka
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.720]   crazy commerce deal where they give them a bunch of money, I
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.640]   guess, to bail out the investors. And that one is as
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.720]   conflicted up and down as you could possibly imagine. They
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.880]   know Microsoft structured that deal in a way that could avoid
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.880]   regulatory scrutiny. You heard that here first. Actually, we
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.040]   talked about this concept of a shadow acquirer on this very
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.000]   program when we saw it because we'd never seen a deal like
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.880]   that. It had includes that $650 million licensing fee. All
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.440]   right, there's tons of other angles here. But let's start
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.720]   with you, Chamath, what are your thoughts on this regulatory
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.200]   capture and NVIDIA's ascension? For those of you not watching,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.440]   it's almost become the largest market cap company in tech.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.640]   Actually, today, NVIDIA passed Apple for a moment in time. So
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.640]   this is pretty crazy what we've seen with NVIDIA. And here we
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.400]   got regulatory capture coming in hot. Chamath, your thoughts?
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   I have two thoughts. They're sort of mixed emotions. The
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.560]   first is, I think the DOJ and the FTC are totally way out of
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.920]   their ski tips on this. This is a totally nascent industry. We
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.200]   don't have any good examples of end user use cases, either at
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.960]   the enterprise or amongst consumers. We only have 18
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.840]   months of spend history. It is true that we've spent probably
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   750 billion to a trillion dollars collectively now, yep, on
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.280]   things with the AI label. But it is also true that that's
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.480]   probably generated less than $10 billion in revenue. So I don't
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.000]   see what they're exactly investigating in an extremely
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.480]   immature market where we haven't yet seen one cycle of boom and
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.680]   bust, so that we know what we're actually dealing with. So it's
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.040]   way too premature. And it's just people afraid and tilting at
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.600]   windmills. The second part, the part that's mixed, though, is we
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.680]   are seeing a clever form of deal making that these huge
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.480]   hyperscalers are doing to work around the traditional
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.800]   constraints that you've had on businesses. Jason, you and I
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.920]   worked at AOL in a moment where AOL paid a very dear cost for
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.640]   essentially round tripping revenue. Yep. Microsoft had to
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.800]   go through a huge DOJ inquiry and a settlement decree. And
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.480]   they were in the penalty box for most of Steve Ballmer's tenure
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.440]   as a CEO, a lost decade. And the handcuffs came off when Satya
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.960]   took over that business. So I think what I'm trying to say is
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.840]   folks have become extremely sophisticated at replacing round
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.600]   tripping with these complicated tack 2.0, whatever you want to
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.640]   call it credit oriented deals. They'll finance you to buy their
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.480]   own chips. All of this stuff has to be scrutinized a little bit
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.400]   more. So that part I support. But all of a sudden, launching
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.520]   an antitrust investigation makes no sense. So I really think the
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.400]   inquiry should be coming from the SEC about is this real
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:50.800]   revenue.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.920]   That's actually the key issue. And this goes to Chamath, what
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.400]   we talked about, like, let's, if we're going to police something
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.320]   tactics, make sense, not competition, which has been Lena
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.600]   Khan's sort of approach to this, and she's only going to be in
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.400]   the position for another couple months, but the election goes
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.760]   the way it's going. So this might all be moot. Freeberg, I
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.520]   want to get your thoughts on this. We had that great talk
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.600]   2851 miles from from bill, and regulatory capture at the
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.080]   summit, you can look, it would be in the show notes. If you
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.640]   haven't seen it. It's great talk for your thoughts on this.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.800]   I don't know what regulatory capture Nvidia, are you talking
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.160]   about regulatory capture of Nvidia,
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.360]   just regulatory capture in the framing of AI? Is it too early?
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   Hey, we're like, in the we're not even in the first ending
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.920]   here. And already, we're going to start investigating
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.000]   everybody. And it just seems pretty sure
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.160]   one of the silly aspects is they just passed this law in
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.400]   California, Newsom warns against perils of over regulating AI.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.360]   Oh, good. Governor Newsom warned on Wednesday against stifling
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.000]   the burgeoning AI sector. I mean, Newsom is well informed by
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.800]   the tech community. So sure, I don't think he and he's also an
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.360]   intelligent person. So I don't think he'd kind of, you know,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   fall quickly in line on this one. But the way that the
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.320]   statutes were written, is there's a definition on the size
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.800]   of a model, which in and of itself is very quickly changing.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.440]   As we know, we've seen recently significant reductions in model
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.600]   size, that actually improve performance overall of the model
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.920]   for specific applications. And it's very likely we end up
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.280]   seeing a lot of more smaller targeted models being used in
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.520]   specific applications, instead of one massive general purpose
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.240]   model being used, or networks of smaller models, which is what
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.280]   really where I think the industry is going. And if that's
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.880]   where things go, then this, this statute doesn't even matter, it
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.600]   makes no sense anymore. And that shows you, I think, how quickly
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.240]   things are changing. They go and they get a quote, experts
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.960]   opinions. In a couple of months, those experts come back, they're
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   like, here's the size of a model that you need to be regulating.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.760]   And then the legislators run, and they write the code, they
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.560]   pass the statute. And all of a sudden, it doesn't even make
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.440]   sense anymore. So yes, I don't think we really know where this
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.200]   technology is all falling out at this point. And I think it's
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.560]   very difficult to have the government kind of reach in too
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.280]   quickly to try and identify what they should and shouldn't be
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.440]   allowing to happen from a free market perspective.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.520]   Your thoughts, David Sachs, especially in light of the fact
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.000]   that looking like we're going to have some regime change in
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.880]   Washington, and the FTC is going to going to going to turn over,
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.160]   obviously, if that happens.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.360]   Well, look, I agree with you guys, this is just too soon to
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.720]   be opening these investigations. It's true that
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.520]   OpenAI and Nvidia have leads in their respective markets, but
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.040]   that's all it is at this point. It's way too early in the
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.560]   development of these markets to say that these are clearly
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.160]   monopolists. There's still a lot of competition going on. If a
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.520]   few years from now, Nvidia still has whatever 85 90% market share
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.000]   and no one's even close to catching up, then maybe you
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.360]   consider it a monopolist. Same thing with OpenAI. But it just
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.480]   seems very early to be rushing into investigations of these
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.760]   companies. I mean, the AI market is what 18 months old to two
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.040]   years old, maybe at most,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.400]   I'd say two is a good way to look at it. Yeah.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.320]   So it's just very early to be doing this. Look, I think this
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.520]   is of a piece with remember that executive order or whatever
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.480]   that remember when the White House issued that 100 page plus
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.440]   executive order on AI regulation, we covered it on the
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.600]   show. And we also thought that was too soon. And we thought
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.960]   that if the internet had been regulated in that way, in you
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.040]   know, circuit 1995 or 1997, it never would have blossomed the
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   way that it did. You know, you want to give these markets some
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.480]   time to play out before you bring that down the heavy hand
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.160]   of regulation on them. So it just seems to me like the
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.920]   administration is getting carried away here with this
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.520]   desire to regulate this new space. And I mean, frankly, it's
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.920]   of a piece with you, I would say an innovation, a hostile
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.000]   agenda, you also have the attacks on crypto, you just had
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.360]   buying veto a bill that would have finally given crypto
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.600]   regulatory framework in the US, it passed with 60 votes in the
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   Senate, including Democrats like Chuck Schumer. And it still
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.080]   wasn't good enough. And oh, and it was based on a framework. I
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.320]   think that came from the SEC. Yeah. But Biden is basically in
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.120]   the Elizabeth Warren camp that he's going to give no quarter to
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.040]   crypto. So you've got hostility to AI, you've got hostility to
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.920]   crypto, you've got hostility to M&A, no one can get an M&A deal
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.120]   through right now, you put all these things together. Plus,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.560]   you've got hostility to options as compensation in terms of the
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:42.520]   25% unrealized gains tax. You add up all these things. And
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.880]   again, I think this is an agenda that does not benefit Silicon
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.800]   Valley at all.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.600]   Well, and if you want to understand why people are coming
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.240]   to your fundraiser tonight, if you put all this together, it
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.560]   doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you're a venture
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.280]   capitalist or an entrepreneur, and you want to see M&A, and you
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.000]   want to see entrepreneurship, and you want to see your
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.160]   companies thrive, you want to see your employees get rich and
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.320]   have options. Biden is basically handing the election to Trump.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.600]   It's like he's doing everything he can to basically alienate
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.760]   Silicon Valley. So capitalism, you're exactly right.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.040]   And innovation. I wouldn't even say it's Silicon Valley. It's
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.480]   like if you're going to go and build things that are at the
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.960]   bleeding edge, you know, the government used to be the most
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.440]   critical supporter of that. Right? If you think about space
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.720]   or defense, these are areas, the internet itself, the government
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.120]   was the partner of private industry to make sure that there
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.880]   was no regulation. And that like really, really exact looking
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.560]   innovation could happen. That's should be their role.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.480]   And this speaks to this decel versus acceleration movement
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.160]   that we see here in Silicon Valley. And this is what we see
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.280]   in Texas, Florida, UAE, Riyadh, Doha, there are places in the
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.240]   world, Singapore, where people are accelerating innovation. And
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.760]   this is what humans want, not just entrepreneurs, not just
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.840]   venture capitals, all of us want to see an acceleration of
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.400]   innovation. Everybody wants to see prosperity. And if you put
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.520]   yourself up as the D cell candidate, we're not going to
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.640]   allow M&A, we're going to screw with options, we're going to do
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.640]   all this stuff, people just not going to vote for you. And
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.280]   people want crypto legal. So take the memo. I mean, this, I
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.240]   mean, the fact that Democrats can't feel the candidate that
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:24.000]   aligns with the what humanity wants, is absolutely
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.600]   mindboggling. This is why I think Biden's getting hot swap
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.880]   this month. You heard it first. He's got I know, Gavin is going
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.240]   to be running for president, it's going to be Trump and
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.880]   Gavin, they're swapping Biden. After this first debate, Biden
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.600]   is going to get demolished by Trump in the debate. It's going
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.480]   to be elder abuse. He's getting wiped out and hot swapped. You
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.320]   heard it here first.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.400]   Well, there's a lot of a lot of conspiracy theorists online who
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.280]   agree with you a lot of tit for tat speculation that I'm gonna
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.640]   get switcheroo hot swap. But look, I mean, I think you make
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.480]   the correct point, which is, you know, I don't really think about
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.960]   it this way. But you're right, Biden is the D cell candidate.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.040]   And nobody wants that. Also, Trump has shown a learning curve
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.120]   where he recently has been saying positive things about
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.600]   crypto. Yeah. And he's always, I think, been more pro economic
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.720]   growth. He was a real estate developer from the private
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.240]   sector, he actually understands the economy. So there's no
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   question that he would be more pro innovation, much more pro
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.160]   innovation than Biden. And to your point about this is one of
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.120]   the reasons why people are coming to the fundraiser. I had
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.760]   someone from the campaign said something very interesting to
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.200]   me. She said that we've never seen this many new donors. Yeah,
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.160]   at an event before. So we're turning out the new donors for
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.680]   this reason. Yes. And you know, we're not going to be
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.840]   intimidated by people calling us names. You know, it's like,
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.400]   look, in any normal election, people in an industry would vote
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.200]   for the candidate who they see as most aligned. Yes. With what
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.400]   is good for them, their families, their industry made a
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.880]   list. Let's just make the list here right now. Make the list of
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.080]   things Trump is in support of, right. And Republicans are in
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.920]   support of right now. They're going to be pro M&A, they're
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   going to be pro crypto, they're going to be pro less taxes,
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.440]   they're going to be pro law and order. You know what, that's
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.840]   where I align. Those are the things I want. So if you just
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.160]   list the issues for me, despite how I might feel about Trump and
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.560]   some of the things he's done, he checks off all my boxes, he
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.120]   checks off all my boxes. And I think that's what's happening
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.200]   here. And, you know, people were scared to come out and say this
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.320]   person checks off all my boxes. The Democrats need to realize
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.520]   they're out of sync with America. They're out of sync
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.200]   with powerful people in America, especially the donor base.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.120]   They're the D cell candidate party now. And they just have to
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.440]   flip this thinking they're going to get demolished. It is going
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.640]   to be a landslide at this point. People want jobs and prosperity
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.680]   from your lips to God's ears.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.360]   Do the hot swap. I mean,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   I don't really have a lot more to say. Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.320]   Take the win. And crypto is such an obvious win. And you know
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.080]   what, Trump's anti EV right now he's been wailing on EVs. I
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.440]   guarantee you that's the next thing. I bet you next week he
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.000]   comes out next week. Within the next two weeks. Here's my
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.560]   prediction. Trump says you know what, EV is not so bad. Remember
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.680]   he's been saying EVs nobody wants these things we're
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.280]   subsidizing. I bet you next week or maybe in 30 days I'm making a
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.200]   prediction here. You bank the prediction in 30 days Trump
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.000]   comes out magically in support of EVs.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.840]   Well, I think that his point is that people shouldn't be forced
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.880]   to buy EVs. Right? I mean, I don't think he's against them
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.240]   per se. I think he's against people being forced. I think
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.480]   that what the new administration hopefully, or what Trump should
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.560]   propose is effectively a modus vivendi with big tech, where the
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.600]   point is that if you stop censoring our people, if you
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.080]   stop censoring conservatives, if you restore the civil liberties
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.360]   of the average American to say what they want online to
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.040]   basically bank online, to stop essentially de platforming and
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.360]   censoring people, then we will let you innovate, we'll let you
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.040]   do M&A, we'll let you get back to business. That basically is
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.120]   the basis for a peace agreement between big tech and the
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.000]   Republican Party.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.680]   Yeah. And by the way, I'd say in the next 30 to 60 days, you're
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.400]   gonna see 10 incredibly high profile people come out and
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.000]   support of Trump if Biden isn't swapped out. And when I say high
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.320]   profile, I have the inside line on this extremely high profile
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.680]   people, not just Doug Leonie, not just David Sachs, it's not
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.360]   by up to you. It is going to be about 10 high profile people who
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.880]   are much higher profile respectfully than Chamath and
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.640]   Sachs, and Doug Leonie. So just wait for it, folks. You cannot
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.560]   be a decelerous in, you know, this world. Let's keep moving.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:44.360]   Roaring Kitty, aka Keith Gill, just disclosed a nine figure
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.600]   position in GameStop. Yes, we're back to where this podcast
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.160]   started. We're talking about GameStop and as crazy as it is,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.680]   and a E trade is considering suspending his account. This is
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.520]   going to take a little bit of background. I apologize here.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:03.040]   The D platforming him. Here we go again. Quick background. You
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.160]   remember the first basically viral moment for this podcast is
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.520]   AI moment. I remember I was in Tahoe skiing was the GameStop
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.720]   saga back in 2021. 1000s of retail investors following this
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.160]   individual Keith Gill. We're posting in this subreddit called
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.040]   Wall Street bats if you're not familiar, and they created a
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   massive short squeeze and they sent the stock flying Robin Hood
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.800]   halted the trading member flag came on that one all went crazy.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.240]   We covered that all. And then Keith Gill went silent for the
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.720]   past three years on Twitter and Reddit. He said nothing. Then on
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:41.680]   May 12, he posted this meme on x, which has been viewed 28
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.200]   million times. Now, if you don't know this meme, this is the lean
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.760]   forward mean when you've got a game controller in your hand, it
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.240]   is a way to signal like, hey, we're getting to the boss level,
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.200]   it's gonna get exciting. Here's your GameStop chart, folks. You
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.280]   see that first peak, that's when we reported on it back in 2021.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.440]   And here we go again, it just had a slow ride down for three
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:08.360]   years and bink popped up again. So GameStop stock tripled at the
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.960]   posting of that meme. Why is this important? Well, he has a
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.720]   huge position, he increased it from 200,000 shares, basically
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.360]   to 5 million had 120,000 call options tomorrow. We'll comment
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.000]   on all this in a moment. If he exercised all these calls, still
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.800]   could own an additional 12 million shares. Here's Gary
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:33.000]   Gensler, who was on CNBC Wednesday trying to like, calm
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.520]   the markets down and or try to get control of this craziness.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.040]   Here's the clip. I say to you look, I want to put up a I want
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.120]   to put up a cryptogram. And it's of a chair leaning up, which we
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.880]   know from video game playing means come on, this is the ninth
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.680]   inning, get ready. And we know that I'm a person who happens to
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.480]   like the stock of GameStop. This is the single Come on, get
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.000]   ready. Is this something hypothetically that is that the
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.080]   SEC should worry about?
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.400]   Look, again, it's not so hypothetical, because you're
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   describing things that are in the public domain and in the
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.720]   public is, is, you know, interested in. So but generally
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.320]   speaking, you have to make sure that you don't mislead the
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.680]   public, and that you don't in any way, do things in the
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:27.960]   markets that may be manipulative or misleading. And so that's the
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.800]   key thing in our capital market.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.840]   The key thing is, if you can cure it with disclosure, this is
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.920]   Brandeis, you know, if they disclose that this is something
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.840]   that they call action, then you can't go after them.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.400]   Disclosure is one really key part of our capital markets.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.520]   When you buy the stock of a company, you expect that they
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.840]   give you full and fair disclosure. That's, by the way,
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.440]   not what you're getting right now in this crypto field. So I
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.240]   just, you know, cautionary tale there, that disclosure, but
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:03.320]   disclosure doesn't necessarily protect a bad actor, if they're
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.680]   manipulating a market,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.360]   Shama, you've been you've had a lot of comments on the markets
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.600]   and specifically this one over the years. What are your
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.400]   thoughts is posting this meme, stock manipulation or
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.080]   disclosure?
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.800]   No, it's he's posting a meme.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.000]   Okay, thank you.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.520]   He put a picture on the internet. Okay. I mean, that
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.320]   again, this is like the problem that we have, which is that he
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.040]   disclosed his position in a different way. Now, we don't
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.280]   know whether that disclosure is accurate, because I think it was
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.880]   just a screenshot of like some statement inside of a Reddit
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.280]   thread, right? And then that got posted many times elsewhere. Is
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.480]   this accurate? I don't know. Because he has no obligation as
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.400]   an individual to do any of this stuff. Because he's not running
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.440]   a hedge fund, and he's not running other people's money.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:00.240]   Now, if he was acting in concert with other people, you could say,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.080]   Hey, hold on a second, if you're repping not just your money, but
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.880]   other people's money, and you did this, then there's probably a
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.000]   disclosure obligation there. But at the end of the day, this is
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:20.840]   a guy that acted and basically created hype. And right now, the
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.440]   SEC does not have a framework to deal with that, because the
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.480]   rules that existed didn't understand social media and
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.320]   whatnot. And he's also not a regulated entity. He's just an
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.520]   individual. Now, if it turns out that he was selling while he was
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.120]   posting this stuff and trying to manipulate the market in some
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.120]   way, obviously, they could find issue with that. But just for
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:51.680]   him being a credible influencer, and creating momentum for an
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.840]   underlying position, that in and of itself is not illegal.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.640]   Sacks, I think we have to go to judge sacks here. Judge sacks.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.800]   What is your verdict? Our meme stock manipulation? Judge sacks?
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.320]   No, I don't see any manipulation there. Like Jamal studies is
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.920]   posting a meme. What you saw? Not guilty. What I see in that
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:13.640]   clip is Jim Cramer trying to stir up an SEC investigation of
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.280]   Keith Gill. For what? I mean, what exactly is he done here?
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.680]   This is kind of the Wall Street Journal as well. If you look at
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.040]   the Wall Street Journal today, there's an entire article
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.360]   basically with the headline is what Keith Gill is doing
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.840]   illegal. And I think you can view this in a different lens,
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.000]   which is, here is an individual that is totally outside of the
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.040]   establishment that however he's done it, has gotten a hold of
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.840]   hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even now billions if the
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.320]   stock keeps going. And I think that that for the establishment
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.560]   that controls those pipes, very disconcerting.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.520]   Right? If he if he was one of those apex predators on Wall
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.200]   Street, if he was one of those major hedge funds that donates a
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.760]   lot of money to the political elite, in other words, if he was
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.960]   a well connected political player, I doubt anyone would be
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.040]   asking these questions.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:10.200]   For you got thoughts on this market manipulation or meme
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.480]   stonk, fun, good times, you're buying GameStop, you're paying
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.640]   EMC, like you buyer beware, you're you're in on the joke.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.720]   What are your thoughts?
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.080]   Nick, can you pull up the image? I'm going to talk about the
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:28.360]   stupidity of buying the stock in this company. This is a company.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.400]   And then I think we can talk about whether that's even
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.800]   relevant, which I think indication is that it's not.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:45.760]   GameStop finished the year 2023 fiscal year, with sales of 5.3
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.040]   billion, down from 5.9 billion the year before. So sales
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.120]   declined by 12% in the year, adjusted $1 billion in revenue
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.720]   selling games, adjusted EBITDA for the year was $65 million.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:03.040]   And they have about 1.2 billion in cash. Currently, as of today,
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.600]   the market cap is about 13 and a half billion dollars. So that
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.320]   makes it about a 12 and a half billion dollar enterprise value
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.480]   12 and a half billion divided by 65 million of EBITDA means that
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.280]   this stock is currently trading at about 192 times EBITDA. A
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.560]   business that is profitable and you can say that the profits are
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.240]   stable and predictable and is likely not going to grow very
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.120]   much will typically trade for seven to 12 times EBITDA. And
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.960]   this stock is trading at 192 times EBITDA and the revenue is
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.320]   declining 12% a year. So I'll just point out like, I don't
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.000]   think that there's anything about the actual performance of
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.560]   the underlying business and the security that you are buying or
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.120]   selling when you are making a decision about whether or not to
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.920]   buy or sell the security. And I think that that's the real
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.760]   question. It does that even matter? Clearly, it doesn't. Let
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.960]   people have fun, let them go to Vegas, let them play in the
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.040]   roulette table, they know what they're getting into the
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.280]   disclosures are all there. All the SEC filings are there, all
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.920]   the financials of this business are there, what you're actually
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.160]   buying is publicly viewable, you can look at it, you can make an
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.800]   investment decision as an individual investor and trader,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.960]   and you want to blow your money, trying to see when the social
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.400]   trends are going to shift one way or another. Let it be your
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:15.920]   decision.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.600]   I think this is well said. If you're buying NFTs, if you're
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.240]   buying stonks like this, if you're playing poker in a, if
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.400]   you're playing bomb pots, look it up, folks, if you don't know
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.760]   what bomb pots are, and you're going crazy playing bomb pots
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.240]   for eight hours, like we did the other week, you're there to
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.120]   gamble. If you are playing bomb bots, this is the bomb pots of
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:41.400]   the stock market, have fun, go crazy. If you're buying NFTs, if
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.640]   you're buying crypto, and you know what you're getting into,
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.560]   there's no law, there's no law that defines why you should or
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.920]   should not buy a security with respect to the diligence you
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.040]   have individually done to determine whether the underlying
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.960]   business is worth the price you're paying. Yes, the law
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.400]   says that the businesses that are listing their securities for
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.640]   public trading have an obligation to make disclosures
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.040]   on their financials, and any other material events to the
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.200]   public. And they do that through the SEC filing process. That's
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.600]   all out there. And then what you as an individual do with it is
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.120]   up to you.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.440]   Enough with the nanny state. Go ahead, sex.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.240]   So when's the right time to put a short on this company?
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:25.800]   The stock is up 40% today. And then there's these reports that
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   came out yesterday on a bunch of very big hedge funds that put
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.960]   very big short positions yesterday on the stock and it's
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.920]   up 40% today. Here we go to get margin call. So this is where
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.040]   you see the same thing that happened last time where what
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.960]   was that guy's name? The
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.680]   the capital?
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.080]   Melvin Melvin.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.200]   Get
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:49.440]   out on the wrong side of this, you're gonna get plotkins.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:56.640]   Don't get plotkin in a sour moochie. Yeah, that's what you
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.120]   don't want to do. Because you could lose it all in a sacra
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.360]   moochie or it's basically a game where, you know, the Redditors
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.960]   are they bid up? They bid up the stock? Yes, to levels that
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.080]   realistically, it's not worth that much disconnect. It's a
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.360]   big, it basically creates a short squeeze. So the stock
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.880]   flies up. Yeah. Then the hedge funds know it's overvalued. So
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.520]   they basically put new shorts on. Yeah. And then they do the
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.400]   next short squeeze.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.800]   And they'll do something that's even more dangerous, which is
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.000]   they can get synthetically short. So they'll, they'll add
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.640]   leverage to this, using all kinds of esoteric derivatives
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.800]   that other banks on Wall Street will happily sell them. And then
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.760]   when those are disclosed, then the Redditors can just pump it
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.320]   even more, which causes massive margin call. So I think that I
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.520]   think the thing that Friedberg you're saying, though, this is
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.160]   this existential thing that comes back, it's happened in
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.800]   NF T's, it's happened in the dotcom bubble, it happened in
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   SPACs, it's happened in crypto. Are we supposed to protect
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:57.080]   people? And then the question is, who is the we? And are you
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.480]   supposed to say, if you're an adult, and you can read, then
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   read the disclosures, and you're on your own. That's what the SEC
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.240]   says. Yeah, and that's what the rule of law has been. And so
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.840]   this is going to be an interesting test, because
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.520]   instead of an organization, it's going to be a person in this
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.240]   case, Keith Gill, who will be the face of what happens to the
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.040]   stock, because if a bunch of people all of a sudden, plow
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.760]   into this thing, and then it goes to five, it'll be really
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.360]   interesting to see the reaction, hey, you should have saved us,
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.680]   how could this happen? You know, he dumped this on all of us. And
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.440]   the answer is no, he did not. Where was the government to save
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.760]   our day? Where's the government to protect consumers? That's
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.720]   not with the nanny state. That's the next cycle of the story. The
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.920]   next cycle of the story is no, the government. Yeah. And you
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.120]   showed how the government protected everybody, which was
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.000]   you showed the revenue, and the profits and the margins, which
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.440]   is publicly available.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.320]   And you did it in two minutes. I mean, anybody, anybody can look
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.080]   at your analysis and see,
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.400]   you didn't even use a sophisticated model, you use
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.160]   probably the calculator app on your frickin Mac to figure out
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   that it was 192.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:04.520]   No, no, I'm sure he used the calculator app. So you actually
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.600]   have the SEO. The whole point is, you can figure out that
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.000]   there's no logical justification for this company using one
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.240]   Google search and the calculator app on your Mac. Yeah. It's on
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.520]   you. I think the question is, should we make all sports
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.200]   betting legal and all online casinos legal? So if you follow
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.320]   this to its natural conclusion, let people do what they want.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.400]   Why are all of the other gambling industries so tightly
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.160]   regulated? I think there's a difference. Well, because we
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.960]   need a stock market, we need we need the ability for companies
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.840]   to go public. It just so happens that you can get this weird
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.120]   effect where some stocks can become meme stocks. But that
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.880]   doesn't mean you want to design the entire system of securities
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.200]   laws around one or two meme stocks. The fact of the matter
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.320]   is that investors are sufficiently protected by robust
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.160]   disclosure requirements that apparently GameStop has
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.560]   followed. All that information is out there. You basically
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.040]   dismantled the company in like two minutes. So anyone watching
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.880]   this show has all the information they need not to buy
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.560]   this stock at 190 times earnings, okay, if they choose
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.640]   to follow that information.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.920]   The other thing that you're saying, which is really
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.240]   important is you have to remember what the capital
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.720]   markets and the stock market is therefore it's not meant for
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:27.200]   this. This is a small little cul de sac. But the overwhelming
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.680]   majority of the capital markets and the equity markets is to
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.760]   allocate excess capital to good ideas. That's what is usually
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.360]   happening. There's a bunch of us that will put a bunch of our
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.200]   money into things because we think it's the right thing to
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.000]   do. And that is the overwhelming majority of what is happening
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.360]   in the stock market every day. And David's right every now and
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.680]   then one of these things randomly comes up. And every
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.120]   period of time, there'll be a few parts of the market that go
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.320]   crazy. But the reality is that's not what the overwhelming
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.160]   majority of the actions and that's not why the security
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.520]   solution.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.720]   Have you guys seen this guy? His name is Tim Nackey on
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.640]   Instagram. So what this guy did, this guy's incredible. So this
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:11.360]   guy went out. And he basically bet 10 cents and online blackjack
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.240]   because he's legally allowed to do it where he lives. I think
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.880]   he's in Australia or something. Oh, yeah, that's 10 cents for
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.360]   every follower he has on Instagram. So over the last
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.880]   couple of months, he's been right. Yeah, he's been racking
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.160]   and racking up the bets. And he ended up doing these $100,000
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.120]   plus bets because he got over a million followers. He ran this
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.880]   thing up to over a million bucks and he quit. But it's it's now
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.120]   he's formed like a blackjack syndicate. So everyone wants to
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.880]   kind of pile in and bet with him. I think that there's this
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.800]   really interesting phenomenon of like social betting. Everyone
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.400]   wants to be in a group together. He's got hundreds of 1000s of
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.560]   people that have put money in this is so great. And then he
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.520]   goes and does this online gambling. Nick pulled the video
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.560]   up. I just say you watch how this guy and he's so
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.080]   entertaining. He's awesome. Oh, man. This is this could be
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.160]   deadly for sacks. sacks didn't know about this.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.840]   blackjack and betting 10 cents for every Instagram follower.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.480]   I've got there are 940,000 of your weapons with us now. So a
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.720]   $94,000 bet coming right up.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:07.720]   Alrighty, ladies and gentlemen, we have a $94,000 on the line
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.480]   for the 940,000 of your weapons with us 90 on the button. Okay,
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.600]   each of the side bits this bloke definitely gloves up both hands
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.200]   on the golf course never has such an impact on my life. I'm not
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   healthy for gross seven versus six. There might be a double
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.560]   down. There might be doubling down. I'll take three.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.800]   That's a double down. Double down. Yeah, yeah, definitely
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.560]   double down. God damn you go change for me here. Of course
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:59.400]   we're counting cars again. I will see you tomorrow you smug
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.760]   son. Oh my god. This is so great. This guy is so good.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.240]   sacks. Do you know about this?
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.080]   That's some serious degeneracy. It looks so fun, though.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:15.680]   There's only one a day. Oh my god.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.760]   And every day his follower count goes up. So every day he bets
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.960]   more. And then you're following he ran this thing up to a
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.280]   million a profit. Oh, so good. I haven't seen sacks this awake
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.920]   during the pod. You don't get the 10 cents. He keeps it from
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.760]   so he started this just by betting his own money. And he
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.200]   would put 10 cents down every day for how many followers he
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.080]   had. Okay, he he started betting more and more of his own money.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.560]   account that he can but I'm saying is it still all of his
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.440]   money that he's betting? So then as of a few weeks ago, or like
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.840]   a two weeks ago, he stopped betting his own money. He took
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.800]   the million off the table. He called it a day and he set up a
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.080]   syndicate. And now people send their own money in and he's
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:52.200]   betting the syndicates money. And he does one hand a day and
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.720]   he keeps racking this thing up. It's just but what happens when
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.760]   he loses? Is there a day where he's lost a lot of money? Oh,
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.000]   dude, you gotta watch it. Man. It's so I want to see what
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.480]   happens when he loses like this is great. Can we hit the sky at
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.840]   the all in summit online blackjack? Right. So there's
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.360]   always like a fake dealer. And he has all this hilarious
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:10.880]   commentary.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.800]   Let's set up an account right now. I'll be honest with you.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.440]   This may get me back on Instagram.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.440]   This is so juicy. Ah, we should get this guy out to the summit.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.880]   This guy's got to come to the summit and do a live hand with
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.160]   Mr. He's big, big shout out. Is he on tiktok or no just I think
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.320]   he only does Insta. Yeah, Tim Knack. I haven't seen sacks
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.520]   listen to Freeberg on this podcast more than he just did.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.200]   That was incredible. You got sacks his attention. sacks. Did
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.640]   you know you could play live online blackjack from your phone?
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.600]   You know this tonight? Did I know that? This is important
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   information for all of us.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:51.120]   Big day coming up. There is 514,000 of you in email and a
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:55.960]   $51,400 bid coming up. All right, day 60 a monumental day.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:02.800]   We can hit the 50k button here. We will do $50,000. $800 on the
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.960]   21 plus three $600 on the perfect peers. This is by far
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.720]   and away the biggest bet I have put on a table in my life. We're
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:16.320]   trying to itch ourselves into gambling immortality. 14 plays
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:21.960]   three. No. Oh, it's a disgusting pull on day 60 with all the
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.120]   marbles on the line. We will stand and look for 10 10 and
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.920]   bust 10 10 and bust. 10 10 and bust. Come on. 10 10 10 heroics
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:37.400]   to be a hero. Yes. Yes. Yes. Day 60. Stick that in your pipe.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:45.320]   Holy. Oh my god. We've broken the push streak with the
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.680]   adventures of 10 10. And you better believe that means I'll
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.080]   see you tomorrow. And I'll be betting even more. This guy's
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.280]   got great energy. Can he do one live on the show next week? Oh,
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.200]   day 55. Oh, here we go. Instagram follower I've got
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.920]   outrageously. There is an extra 21,000 of you in here today. So
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:07.120]   $37,600 bit going on for the 376,000 of you legends in here
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.120]   now. Coming right up. Okay. Day 55 brings about a big I don't
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:18.960]   like this deal. We have $36,000 on the button 1000. And $600 on
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.320]   the perfect peers that D 7.6 k total bits are closed. We've
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.000]   just had a goddamn dealer change. We've been duped here.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.840]   I'm cool. I'm cool.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:36.520]   plays a 12 v king. Oh my god before I before I hit the hit
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.160]   button. I will say this having talked to the morning rumble
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.080]   this morning. Last time I spoke to the media about this journey.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.080]   I broke a six day winning streak that day and I lost so if it
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.280]   happens again today, this one's on Roger Farrelly. We need to
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:55.000]   see eight or nine go low. No. Oh my god. Come on that dealer
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.400]   change was so good. I guess you just can't win them all. But
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.600]   we've been and I will see you tomorrow. When we'll be bidding
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.400]   even more that dealer change was so dirty. You saw the dealer
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.920]   change at the last minute he came up and they changed the dealer.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:13.360]   They asked me before I've been with you and they do that every
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.000]   time with you start running it up. They send in the dealer to
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.040]   ice you. I think there's a particular dealer they've got.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.600]   You know, they do. It's like in the bullpen. The blank cooler.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.680]   Yeah, we know the one the black cooler. I don't want to say
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.840]   anything but it's the cooler. We need this guy next week on the
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.200]   pod to do the live bet and then we each give them 5k. How about
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.680]   that? You guys in I've had them trot out the cooler. When I was
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.080]   playing craps once, I was so mad. And I was on such a heater.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:44.040]   And what happens is, you guys have seen me play craps where
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.400]   it's like it's all rhythm, right? So it's like, yes, I get
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:50.600]   the dice in a certain way. Yeah, you know, I do. They bring in
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.000]   this guy. And he was like a clutch. It's like Daniel Day
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.760]   Lewis in my left foot. All of a sudden he's everything over for
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:04.040]   dice fall off the table. I got so out of rhythm. It was so I was
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.440]   so I want this guy in the pod next week. We're each putting
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.600]   five dimes in we got 20k from all in. Let's do it. That would
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.400]   be so much. Oh my god, we should get him to play a special all in
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.920]   hand and let him run up our capital on the summit. Let's
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.960]   take the profits from the summit and do a live hand. We could put
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.880]   like a million bucks each on it. We double up and then we're done
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.040]   with the pod. We don't have to do a summit next year. Really
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:30.200]   good idea. Let's do it. Let's let it roll. All right. God,
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.760]   this is so much action for us. I don't know if we can continue
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.720]   but there's more stories to come. And just buyer beware. I
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.240]   mean, if you're betting on this stuff, I mean, what do we have
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.040]   to tell you if you're betting on GameStop?
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.080]   We don't have to tell you anything. You're an adult.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.400]   You're an adult. Go to your own job. Well, here's something
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.120]   really interesting. Seatbelt. Don't drink and drive. Don't use
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.600]   drugs. I mean, it's like, all of a sudden, like we need to
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.080]   govern how you're not a functioning adult.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:01.400]   By the way, if you swim in Cape Cod alone in the deep water in
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.600]   the kelp, you might get hit by a great white shark.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.280]   Or do whatever you want. And please just take responsibility
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.880]   for yourself. It's not our job. Absolutely. And I'm responsible
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.040]   for my children, not you.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.800]   Well, I mean, also, it's, I just want to ask one question here.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.080]   Is there anything with the short selling that could there could
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:19.080]   be more disclosure on that trim off that just if the SEC was
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.400]   going to do something, I hear that bubble up once in a while,
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.440]   should be more disclosed.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.120]   I really think that's a very good idea. I do think that there
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.120]   are some short sellers who are doing it because they have to
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.160]   hedge a position that they have. But then there are other short
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.280]   sellers who are doing it speculatively. And there are
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.240]   synthetic instruments that banks will sell you to go massively
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:42.000]   super short. That's how you can get a situation where 140% of
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.320]   the stock is sold short, which doesn't shouldn't make sense. If
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.720]   there's only 100 shares of a company, how could it be that
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.120]   140 shares are sold short, it's because you can have these
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:50.640]   synthetic
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   expensive static for the audience, because I don't think
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.560]   people know this concept.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.960]   So there are ways where if you have a formal trading
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.880]   relationship with Wall Street, and you need to be of a certain
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.160]   size, and they go through a diligence process, they give
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.480]   you so you know, I have one called an ISDA. And it's
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.640]   essentially an account and a framework that you negotiate
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.720]   with a bank that allows you to call them and say, Hey, give me
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.640]   a B or C. And other times they'll call you and say, Hey, I
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.200]   have this really interesting way to play XYZ. And one of the
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.520]   things that you can do with them is you can say, Listen, I want
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.000]   to go super, super long, or super, super short, a theme or a
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.520]   company. And they'll create a contract with between you and
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:39.200]   them. That'll allow you to get that kind of exposure. Now,
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.840]   you're not supposed to do that on a regular basis, nor are you
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.360]   supposed to lever this up. This is actually what blew up a
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.920]   different hedge fund called archaic goes, I remember we
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.520]   covered it. And in that, I guess what happened was, the gentleman
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.400]   was calling many banks and doing all these things. And one bank
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.520]   didn't know what the other bank was doing. So all of a sudden,
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.040]   there was this massive synthetic leverage that he was getting on,
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.920]   I think it was news Corp stock. And then they found out that it
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.200]   was unwound, then he owed a bunch of money, he couldn't pay
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.640]   it, the whole thing shut down, the stock market went crazy. So
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.680]   so no way that disclosure, but there isn't a rule that says
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.840]   that. And every time somebody tries to introduce it, the
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.880]   broker dealers basically lobby and kill it.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.720]   So in a way, it's almost like a parallel universe where bets are
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.640]   occurring on outcomes in the stock market that are not tied
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.200]   to the stocks in the stock market.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.680]   Well, it is tied in the sense that ultimately, it all needs to
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:36.800]   feed back to an actual physical share. So this is where all this
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.360]   price behavior gets further amplified. I think the point is
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:43.240]   that these forms of expressing risk, yes, can really amplify
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.560]   what would otherwise happen. So when freebirds example, most
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.960]   people would sit there get the financials. Some would maybe say
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.800]   historically, this thing looks like a short or I wouldn't even
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.000]   buy it at all, right. But other people may say, Well, if I
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.560]   listened to the chairman, and I think about the future, maybe I
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.600]   go long, that's a, that's a fine thing, you can enter the stock
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.800]   market and do that. But all this other stuff amplifies all these
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.440]   things to a degree that we're not really used to.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.600]   And let's be honest, the people who are betting, I'll use the
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.200]   word betting here, the people who are betting on these things
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.880]   are not looking to get a 7% return or beat the average. I
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.040]   mean, they're looking to double their money in 48 hours. They
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.000]   know what they're getting in for, they're just walking up to
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.280]   the roulette table and putting 10k on black or red, and then
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.840]   clapping and seeing five reds in a row and saying, Oh, it's got
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.120]   to be black next. I mean, they're Phil Helmy within this.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:35.120]   They don't say that when they lose them. No, of course not.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.000]   Yeah, no, no personal ownership here. Well, here's an
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.680]   interesting thing that's sort of related a little bit of
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:45.440]   jurisdiction shopping or placing of companies and products
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.160]   continues in Texas is very hot in this regard. BlackRock and
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.180]   Citadel are backing new stock, a new stock exchange take on the
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:56.240]   New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ duopoly. So according to
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.280]   the Wall Street Journal, the exchange would be based in Texas
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.400]   and called the Texas Stock Exchange or the TX s e, they've
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.340]   raised 120 million so far, it seems like a low number. And the
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.600]   general pitch here is the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.600]   have become expensive, and they've been increasing their
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.440]   compliance costs. NASDAQ has a new board of diversity target
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.000]   that went into effect at the start of this year, all the DEI
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.420]   stuff. And so this exchange is pitching itself as a CEO
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:26.440]   friendly, and the anti woke exchange. So here's the plan
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.000]   timeline file and FCC registration docs later this
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.240]   year start facilitating trades next year, post the first new
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.800]   listing in 2026. Interesting, I guess that Citadel and Black
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.300]   Rock are in this group, because they can bring a lot of
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.280]   business, obviously. And you know, some of this other stuff
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.480]   that's been going on with Texas, Texas is now Tesla's corporate
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.000]   headquarters, they moved to Palo Alto in California, Texas in in
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.720]   2021. Your thoughts here, Chamath on movie love it. Okay,
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:56.160]   why? Why do you love it so much to tell competition?
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.320]   I do think that it's hard right now for companies to get access
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:08.460]   to capital. I think more diverse and more flexible ways where
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.700]   smart investors can allocate their money into the ideas that
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:16.540]   they want are better. I think that the duopoly hasn't created
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:19.500]   enough competition. So the NASDAQ and, and New York Stock
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.340]   Exchange haven't innovated. And in fact, they've, they've
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.820]   probably been a little regressive. In terms of filing
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.260]   requirements, listing requirements in terms of board
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.620]   composition, they've fallen for a bunch of things that don't
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.820]   actually point to the economic rationale or value in a company.
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.020]   And so I think if you have a third player, there's a chance
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.780]   that more competition will create more rational behavior,
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.220]   which will flow into the companies themselves. So I'm a
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.220]   huge fan of this. I think that the the stock exchanges right
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.460]   now are too brittle, because and there's and that large reason is
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.460]   because there's only two of them.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.260]   Freeberg, any thoughts for you about more options?
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.180]   Well, I think part of this is actually there's been these
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:12.740]   rules imposed by NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange that have
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:17.540]   tried to enforce upon the listed companies, rules and regulations
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.020]   that are not tied to securities laws, including some of these
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.980]   aspects of diversity of your board. And I know that there
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:29.940]   have been a lot of public company, board members, and CEOs
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.220]   that have quietly tried to push back on these rules, that
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.900]   they're imposing social systems upon, you know, what is
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.940]   effectively a regulated exchange. And so there's
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.860]   certainly like an interest in a pushing for a competitive
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.220]   marketplace for exchanges. There was a survey done recently that
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.260]   showed I got to find some of this data, but it showed the
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.940]   cost of going public on NASDAQ, Amex or the New York Stock
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:57.260]   Exchange was about $7.4 million. Cost of going public through an
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.780]   over the counter bulletin board listing service was about $2
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.380]   million. And then there's these additional kind of rules that
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.540]   are being imposed if you want to be listed on the big boards. So
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.940]   clearly, there's interest and it's great to see a competitive
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.700]   market emerge, you know, how there have, by the way, there
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.500]   have been other attempts. There's that long term stock
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.620]   exchange, you guys remember that a couple years ago, that was
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:21.900]   incentivized long term holdings. There was two other equity
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.660]   security exchanges, efforts made in the last couple of years that
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.180]   didn't take off. So this isn't super novel in terms of like
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.780]   seeing a new challenger exchange step up, but I think more
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:33.900]   competition is always better.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.260]   All right. In other news, Apple and OpenAI have reportedly
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.380]   struck an iPhone deal. According to Bloomberg, Apple is going to
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.420]   announce a major partnership with OpenAI at WWDC next week
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.460]   chat GPT will be integrated into iOS, which means Apple is
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.540]   outsourcing its AI chatbot at least at the start. I guess
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.660]   you could argue it benefits both sides because OpenAI gets access
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.940]   to over a billion phone users and Apple gets a native
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:01.260]   integration of a top tier language model. Terms are not
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.340]   clear. But most people think this is going to be a short to
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:08.460]   midterm deal with Apple building out its own AI chatbot in the
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.180]   future, but it's just not ready for primetime right now also
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.900]   plans to make Siri AI powered and bring AI features to the
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.420]   Apple ecosystem. You have heard that Apple is going to try to
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.980]   let Siri dive deeper into apps, ie if you're ordering your
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.900]   DoorDash or Uber Eats or an Uber or Lyft or whatever, it might
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:29.460]   actually be able to execute those things inside of an app.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.100]   Interesting line from the article, Apple executives were
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.980]   concerned about reputational damage from a rogue chatbot.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.980]   Some people within Apple have a philosophical aversion to having
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:43.740]   a chatbot at all very interesting. So thoughts on
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.220]   this sacks, just getting you back in the loop here.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.660]   Well, we kind of predicted that something like this could or
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:55.140]   should happen. We said that the big win for Apple in AI would be
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:00.380]   to make Siri actually work based on LLM because Siri just, you
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.940]   know, it's understanding of languages historically has not
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.620]   been great. And that's really limited the usefulness of it.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:10.500]   Imagine if Siri worked with the conversational abilities of chat
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.820]   GPT 4.0. If it had that level of semantic understanding, if it
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:18.180]   could talk to you, the way that 4.0 can talk to you, that would
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.180]   make Siri really powerful. And you know, for me, Siri is a
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.300]   feature I've turned off because it's so annoying, but
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.460]   sucks, right? Never works.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:32.020]   If you give it the power of the best open AI model, and then the
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.740]   speed of running it natively on the iPhone, I don't know what
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.020]   they're going to do about that. But presumably, there are things
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.940]   they can do to speed it up. And then you give it access to the
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:45.620]   internal API's you're using to control apps. That would be
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.860]   really powerful. You could be an agent that you can just tell it
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.420]   to do things. And you know, not just ask like the weather and
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.660]   the time and set alarms.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:58.220]   Well, what's really interesting, I think about this deal chamath
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.740]   is Apple is having a hard time getting people to upgrade their
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.980]   phones, right? And people have lost faith in the stock. Now you
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.660]   say, hey, we're going to put a language model on here, you can
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:11.260]   make it a local language model, and have it be privacy
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.460]   protected. So that means you need more memory on the phone,
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.660]   you're going to need another chip on the phone, it's going to
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.540]   there's a distinct reason to upgrade. Now, if you had a
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:23.140]   language model on your phone, and Siri was like this super
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.700]   Siri, that actually got stuff done, I would upgrade my phone
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.820]   immediately. And right now I skipped two or three
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.380]   generations. What are your thoughts on this as a way to
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.540]   maybe reinvigorate the iPhone franchise tomorrow? You buy it
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:38.700]   or not? No, the problem is that we don't know what the right
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:45.300]   form factor for a super scaled consumer AI app looks like. So
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.340]   we've all again, I'm not trying to be a wet blanket. It's just
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.820]   that when you look at what's built and built so far, I think
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:57.380]   most of the things we've seen are the Friendster and my spaces
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:02.100]   of this class of app. We haven't seen the Facebook's and the
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.420]   Instagram's yet. And the reason is because we haven't
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.220]   experimented and push the boundaries of the form factor.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:14.820]   So for example, in the first phases of social networking, the
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.420]   idea that you would collect information about all your
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.060]   friends and then create something called a newsfeed was
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:24.140]   totally shocking. And I remember when we first released that
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.860]   people got really upset. And then it just became this de
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.460]   facto. Why were they upset about it? Tell me? Well, it's this
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.700]   idea that you collected this information, and then you
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.660]   presented it about all of your friends was disconcerting in
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.340]   the shot as a feature. Now, if you don't have a newsfeed of
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:42.740]   some kind in your app, for many apps, it's do a right. So the
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.940]   same problem exists today. All we've done today is we've
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:51.260]   replicated an existing use case with a slightly better feature
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.780]   here or there. Nobody has gone out and said on a blank canvas,
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:01.300]   let me completely reimagine how consumers want value with these
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.860]   things to enable it. And until that happens, we're just
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:08.340]   wasting time. So the idea that Apple with this $1,000 device is
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.620]   all of a sudden going to figure out that this is why you're
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.140]   going to upgrade, I think is pretty speculative. And I think
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.780]   they're going to be disappointed. I think people
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:19.580]   have realized that four generations ago was more than
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:24.900]   enough. And on top of this, the stuff that you value inside the
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:30.420]   iPhone is not what you're going to need for AI. So spending a
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:35.420]   trillion billion dollars on the fourth camera lens is not going
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:40.780]   to be what solves this problem. And so you're more likely to
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.860]   have a very simple earbud that is, you know, very
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.860]   inconspicuous and discreetly in your inner ear. Well, speaking
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:52.060]   information to you, then you are and with a companion $500 phone,
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:55.780]   then I think you will be with a 1500. You're in the new form
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.420]   factor, I am going to take the other side of the cap, I think
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.060]   that because you have this data on your phone, all your
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.580]   iMessages, all your documents, all your photos, videos, music
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.460]   collection, there's a unique set of data on that phone to make
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.500]   your personal LLM, that's going to do extraordinary things for
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.020]   you, because it's going to watch you and all your behavior on
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.860]   that phone. And man, if I can have a personal LLM that's been
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:19.860]   watching me order very specific sushi rolls, or, you know, where
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:23.060]   I send my ubers, what type of ubers I like what music I play,
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.220]   I feel like that LLM don't need to be deep. My point is, you
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.020]   don't need a $1500 device to do that. So if you know, but it's
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:34.020]   I'm talking about data set. So cool. Don't you? Uber has the
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.780]   data. DoorDash has the data. No, no, you're missing my point.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:40.940]   The data of me clicking on the screen, that is not apples to
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.300]   collect. It's not there. I think they'll collect it, put it in
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.740]   there, you would have to encrypt have to fundamentally change the
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.780]   SDK. The idea then that Apple can take a tax on that is
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:53.420]   outrageous. I think the whole app economy would blow up if
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.300]   Apple tried to do that.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.260]   I think it's the opposite. I think the app economy would
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.180]   thrive. You'd be have this a great thing where I could tell
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.540]   it order the same thing I ordered on door.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.580]   Apple to try to change the terms of service and see what happens.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:05.980]   Okay, freeberg your thoughts on this. Any thoughts? No. Okay,
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.540]   well, let's get to this. It's time for science corner
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.340]   temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are alarmingly high.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:15.460]   freeberg. A couple weeks ago, we saw this crazy chart on the X
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:19.020]   about the Atlantic Ocean temperatures, pre Hurricane
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.780]   Katrina right about now and take us through this because it's
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.100]   very disconcerting.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.700]   There's not much to talk about except to highlight this image
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.420]   which shows again, we talked about this a few months ago, hot
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.740]   ocean temperatures drive hurricane and tropical storm
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:40.500]   activity because as the wind, the air above the ocean starts
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:45.220]   to move, the energy from the ocean gets pulled out, you know,
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.140]   like things cool down, the water cools down, but that energy
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.660]   actually goes back into pushing the wind to move faster and
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:55.780]   faster. And that's how tropical storms, cyclones, and hurricanes
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:00.300]   are formed is warm ocean temperatures. And there's been
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.820]   this kind of persistent warming since last year in the Atlantic,
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:09.300]   in this particular region, where all the hurricanes form. And
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.140]   normally the hurricane season starts kind of call it August to
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:16.260]   October. Right now we are seeing temperatures that are so far
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:20.500]   beyond what we've seen. Anytime historically, this image that
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.260]   you're looking at here actually compares the ocean temperatures
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.500]   right now in the Atlantic, to where we were at the same time
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.740]   period in 2005, which was a record hurricane year, obviously
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:34.380]   with Hurricane Katrina, right? Yeah. And so their National
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:37.380]   Hurricane Center, a lot of the climatologists are forecasting
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:40.780]   that over the next couple of months, we could see and should
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.380]   expect to see probabilistically, much larger, stronger, bigger,
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.780]   more frequent hurricanes than we've ever seen historically. So
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.660]   we'll see if it plays out. Just a very small tidbit of news to
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.380]   share, thought it'd be worth highlighting, not getting a lot
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.420]   of main mainstream media press attention. But, you know,
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.220]   certainly,
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.940]   to just confirm a couple of things for me, because we live
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.220]   in a time where people are questioning science and
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.620]   scientists, and we have institutions we don't trust,
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.740]   whether it's three letter agencies in Washington, or
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:11.100]   scientists and all these papers being written and everything
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.180]   we're finding out and nobody trusts anybody. And we're sort
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.500]   of resetting trust. I want to just ask you as somebody I trust
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.300]   as a scientist, number one, global warming, temperatures
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.900]   increasing, putting aside, you know what we do about it
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:27.740]   temperatures in the ocean, it is undeniable are increasing at a
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.100]   rate that you would describe as concerning. Am I correct?
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:36.620]   We have not seen in the modern era, temperatures in the ocean
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.220]   like we're seeing now, that's a fact, right? I'm not going to do
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.580]   this whole big prognosis on everything all in one, because I
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.820]   think that's where people feel like there's room for
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:48.540]   discrediting things. I'm trying to so we can do this. Yeah, we
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.980]   can be very specific about things. Here's an example. So
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:54.020]   this is the sea surface temperature going back to 1981.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.660]   Okay. And as you can see, at this point in the year, and you
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.180]   know, the temperature oscillates because of the way the earth
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:05.100]   tilts towards the sun. And so at this point in the year, we are
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.260]   seeing right now, sea surface temperatures that are beyond
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.380]   anything we've seen, historically, and it is
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:15.220]   continuing to climb. So if this does not taper off or level off,
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.060]   we will see record sea surface temperatures in the August to
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.540]   October timeframe, which will almost certainly push massive
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:25.940]   hurricane events out of the Atlantic, and they will find
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:27.020]   their way towards the continent.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.940]   So this is super clarifying, this should not be controversial
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.700]   to anybody, we have temperature readings in the ocean, and
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.900]   just data, data, it's just simply data, right. So you know,
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.220]   putting aside what political party you on and what you think
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.260]   about gas and oil, I will tell you, there's a lot of theory,
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.220]   one of one of the theories. So there's theories about El Nino,
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.620]   there's theories about climate change contributing to this.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:49.380]   There's also a theory about sulfur dioxide, that has now
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:53.900]   been banned in shipping and cargo vessels that go across the
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.020]   oceans. Last year, they banned sulfur dioxide use in the fuel
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.700]   that that's coming out of these, and sulfur dioxide actually
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:03.540]   reflect sunlight. So as it goes up into the air, into the
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.220]   atmosphere coming out of these ships, it actually blocks and
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:06.940]   reflects light.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.500]   So that would make the oceans cooler.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.980]   And so a lot of folks have said that over the last couple of
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.860]   decades, we've actually dampened the temperature and the warming
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:18.380]   that's happened on earth because of all the sulfur dioxide we've
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.700]   been putting up into the atmosphere. But because sulfur
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.060]   dioxide causes acid rain, environmentalists have been
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.820]   pushing for years to ban sulfur dioxide. The problem is with
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.380]   banning sulfur dioxide, you may have this other side effect,
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:33.820]   which is now more rapid increased warming got of the
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.180]   surface and of the oceans.
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:39.140]   So these are complex systems, and you we should be delicate
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.740]   with them. If you were to give us a prescription here,
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.940]   freeberg. What's like a basic prescription? Are we just
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:52.940]   experimenting in a way that is not advisable with, you know,
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:57.900]   this ecosystem? And we should just not run the experiment. I
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.020]   think that might be like a non political non charged way to say
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.420]   it. Like, this experiment is a little bit too crazy to run on
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:07.660]   the one planet Earth we have. Yeah. Which experiment? The
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:11.980]   experiment of doing things that increase global warming, which
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.660]   would be you mean living? Well, yeah, I mean, not burning
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.860]   fossil fuels. People are just acting in their own economic
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:23.580]   best interest. Yes. And if that economic best interest increases
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:27.660]   temperature so much. I think there's a freeberg that it will
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:31.100]   compromise the oceans and damage them to a point that would be
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.100]   extremely concerning is I guess what I'm getting at.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.740]   There is a reduction in biodiversity that's underway. We
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:41.180]   can see that, like using data, but to Chamath's point, humans
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:46.700]   have prioritized the progression of individuals forward. China
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.260]   had a billion people that came out of poverty in 30 years.
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.740]   Yeah. And they came out of poverty because of the
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.300]   industrialization, making production of consumable goods,
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.780]   that that population gets to consume, they get access to more
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.380]   calories, you get access to more foods, they get to have cars,
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.980]   they get to have houses, all of that making cement making
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.820]   concrete, all of those things require industrial systems. And
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.420]   those industrial systems have a cost. That cost is the dollar
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.540]   economic cost, which we're kind of rationalizing with very
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.500]   productivity, then there's this whole cost that's externalized.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.300]   Got it. Yeah, we understand that. Yeah. Right. So so that's
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.060]   the tension is like, if you're wealthy, if you're a wealthy
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:24.120]   nation, if you're the Western Europe or the United States, you
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.580]   get to stand up and say, stop carbon. But if you're the rest
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.060]   of the world, you're like, I want to have a home. I want to
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:34.180]   write you want to have the same evolution stuff that America
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.380]   went through, or you're I want to I want to progress as a as a
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:40.580]   person, I want to progress as a society. And that's the tension
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:44.040]   that makes us a very difficult problem to resolve, which is how
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.420]   to more the world get to progress. While you were like
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.740]   being cognizant of what I'm trying to get at free bird. I
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.180]   am optimistic. So let me just say this. Oh, yeah, cuz that's
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.400]   what I'm getting at. Are you optimistic? Are you pessimistic?
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:54.920]   Tell us.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.440]   I believe strongly that there is a strong relationship between
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.720]   the output of atmospheric carbon and the deleterious effects we
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:07.280]   see in ecosystems. Okay. That is something I feel like is true
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.480]   from data. I am not however, as pessimistic that the world is
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.360]   going to end in the next decade or two, because I see
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.860]   improvements in productivity, meaning how many units we get
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.480]   out for every unit in or how many units we get out for every
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.700]   unit of carbon that's emitted. And those productivity meaning
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:28.340]   better technology systems are rapidly changing how we make
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.540]   things and how people are accessing goods and services. And
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.180]   I think that that's why I am like, because I'm a techno
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.100]   optimist, I'm optimistic about where things are headed are
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.940]   headed. And it is also why I get very angry and upset about any
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:44.220]   efforts or attempts to slow down the adoption of technology,
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.180]   because these things will pull people forward and make that
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:50.180]   happen faster without all the deleterious side effects that
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:53.140]   we've unfortunately had to do in the absence of technology.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.540]   So trim off, I'll pull you into here. So based on what freeberg
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.500]   is saying here, yes, these things are occurring, but the
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.580]   technology and the advances we're seeing in but one example,
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.780]   solar, and then some people might bring up nuclear and other
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:07.860]   ones, we just had filled to each of my conference this week, give
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:12.580]   a great talk on this. Solar is just getting so cheap, batteries
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.780]   are getting so cheap, putting batteries in your home, putting
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.740]   solar in, you know, and then putting data centers next to
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.700]   nuclear things. This is all adding up to we can solve this
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.500]   problem. And so you to feel optimistic about this?
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.380]   Yeah, totally. I think that climate change stalled when it
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:30.580]   was an emotional and philosophical rallying cry,
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:35.380]   largely of the left. When instead, it became something
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:40.460]   about resilience, and domestic manufacturing, both sides came
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:46.540]   together. And I think we're at a point now where the US is energy
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:51.380]   independence plus, the amount of reliance on non carbon based
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:55.180]   fuels will drive a sea change in the United States, I think it'll
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.900]   be copied in Western Europe. And it's also going to be at enough
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:02.820]   of a low price point where it'll get embraced in the developing
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:07.020]   world. So it's a it's an incredible example of if you
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:12.780]   want to take an idea, and a bunch of solutions, and want to
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:18.500]   die on the hill of messaging and platitudes, it'll make no
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:22.180]   progress. But if instead, you're willing to sort of be less
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:26.580]   extreme about it, and actually just frame it in economic value
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:30.620]   add, all of a sudden, everybody embraces it and just becomes
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.620]   obvious. So I think that we're going to do wonders over the
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:40.660]   next 20 and 30 and 40 years all over the world. To push back on
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:43.980]   the general state of warming. But I think it will have
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:48.140]   happened because the economic incentives aligned, not because
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:48.580]   of
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:53.420]   a philosophical or emotional framing of the issue.
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:57.180]   All right, everybody, this has been a very productive episode
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:01.580]   of the number one podcast in the world, the all in podcast. And
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:04.620]   good luck tonight, gentlemen, with your fundraiser. I wish you
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.740]   great luck. David Sachs and Chamath Palihapiti. Even if it's
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.860]   not my preferred candidate, that's totally fine. We could
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:13.300]   all differ and you can have a great, great event tonight.
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:16.420]   Good luck. I have one thing. Okay, good. I have one more
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:21.340]   birthday in my family. Today, making us all look bad. This is
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:26.140]   one of the most incredible people in my life. charismatic,
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:31.420]   funny, charming, intelligent. It is my bestie David Friedberg
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:32.700]   birthday today. Oh,
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:38.260]   we love you, David. We had a nice little birthday cake at the
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.540]   liquidity summit this week for him. I had a cake made. Thank
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:45.180]   you for showing your birthday. And here we go. And, and it's
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:49.100]   also a k 47. Alan Keating's birthday today is all the same.
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.780]   But I love Alan Keating is one of my 45 and one is 47.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:20:01.620]   Do you know the significance of that? Of course, he's gonna win
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:05.260]   all the elections. And there we go. Here we go. I think it's a
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.220]   sign. It's a sign. Listen, I wish good luck to you all
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.860]   tonight. I hope that it goes off well for you for you, gentlemen.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.980]   And listen, I would love to have Trump on the pod would love to
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:18.140]   have Biden the pop like all things. We just want to have a
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:21.220]   great conversation here. We keep it respectful. Sometimes it gets
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:24.060]   a little chippy, but we love each other. And we love you, the
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.460]   audience for participating in this don't fall for the
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.620]   mainstream media is nonsense in trying to divide and conquer. We
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.540]   got important tasks to do and problems to solve in the world.
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.020]   And the way we do that is through great conversations.
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:38.180]   Hopefully we set a tone. An example for everybody else have
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:41.260]   just had to do that. We still love each other. And sometimes
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:45.660]   some elbows get flown. And it's all good. Chamath sacks. Good
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:50.500]   luck tonight. Freeberg. Happy birthday. And bye. We'll see you
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:55.180]   all next time on the number one podcast in the world. The all in
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.500]   pockets tell you friends about
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.220]   love you guys. Bye bye love you.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.380]   Let your winners ride.
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.260]   Rain Man, David Sachs.
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:10.860]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.660]   it. Love you. Queen of
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:20.860]   besties are
