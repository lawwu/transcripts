[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.800]   - All right, Pastor John, here's a doozy of a question
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.240]   for you that we get via email from time to time.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.580]   So take a drink and a deep breath.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.780]   Here it is.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.820]   What is evil?
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.040]   Evil clearly is something.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.360]   Is it merely the absence of holiness
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.120]   or is it the absence of God?
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.120]   Is there a way to explain the core essence of what evil is?
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.300]   - Wow. (laughs)
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.320]   Some of these questions, Tony, are just,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.300]   I mean, they're just so ultimate, like philosophers.
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.560]   (laughs)
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.600]   We're supposed to do this in five minutes.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.240]   Okay.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.280]   The only reason I have any presumption
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.560]   to answer questions like this
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.400]   is because I have a Bible in front of me. (laughs)
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.160]   I mean, if God hadn't said anything, I would be so stupid.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.760]   Okay, so I think, here's my answer
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.280]   that I'm gonna try to show from the Bible
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.800]   in just a few minutes.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   The core essence of evil is preferring anything
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.100]   more than God, loving anything not for God's sake.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.000]   So evil is an act of preferring.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500]   Where there is no will, no volition, there's no evil.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.780]   Evil is a function of willing.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.920]   Satan's willing, demon's willing, human's willing.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.860]   It's not a function of stuff.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.580]   It's a function of willing.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.580]   And evil is always defined in the Bible
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.320]   in reference to willing in regard to God.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.940]   God is the supreme value in the universe,
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.840]   and therefore evil is defined in reference
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.140]   to this ultimate reality, this ultimate value,
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.580]   ultimate treasure.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.580]   Failing to value the ultimately valuable appropriately
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.100]   is evil, that's what evil is.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100]   Now, here's a text, Jeremiah 2, 13.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.780]   My people have committed two great evils.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.660]   Number one, they have forsaken me,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.020]   the fountain of living waters.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.540]   Number two, they have hewed out for themselves cisterns,
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.700]   broken cisterns that can hold no water.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.300]   So what is evil according to Jeremiah 2, 13?
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.300]   It is preferring broken cisterns to God.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.220]   That's what evil is, preferring anything to God
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.060]   because anything measured against God is a broken cistern.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.360]   God is the fountain of living waters.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.860]   Or here's another one, Romans 3, 23.
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.780]   All have sinned, all have committed evil,
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.420]   and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.420]   So sin is defined in relationship to the glory of God,
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.420]   and fall short of is literally lack, be without.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.940]   Now, why would you lack the glory of God
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.220]   or be without the glory of God?
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.060]   And I think the answer is found earlier in chapter one,
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.020]   verse 23, where it says they've exchanged the glory
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.940]   of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.740]   and birds and animals and creeping things.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.740]   So the reason we lack the glory of God in Romans 3, 23
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.900]   is because we've exchanged it.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.460]   That is, we preferred images,
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.300]   especially the one in the mirror.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.060]   That'd be the 20th century one,
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.780]   rather than say an image of a snake on a pole or something.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.140]   We love the one in the mirror,
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.580]   and we prefer getting praise for ourselves
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.140]   rather than getting praise for God
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.100]   and being made much of rather than making much of God.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.040]   So sin is feeling, doing, and saying anything
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   that reflects the exchange of God for lesser things.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.000]   Sin is feeling, doing, saying anything
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.460]   that reflects the exchange of God for lesser things.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.640]   So here's one more textual example.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.640]   Take the 10 Commandments.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.280]   Most people think the 10 Commandments
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.120]   are a good summary of what's right or what's good,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.040]   and yet almost all of them are stated
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.820]   in terms of negation.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.400]   Don't do this, don't kill, don't steal,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.680]   don't commit adultery.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.300]   So it is renouncing evils.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.720]   Now here's the interesting thing.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.620]   The first commandment,
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.440]   you shall have no other gods before me, Exodus 23,
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.200]   and the last commandment, you shall not covet,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.320]   I think are virtually saying the same things,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.520]   one negatively and one positively.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   Don't covet means don't prefer things you shouldn't prefer.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.080]   Don't have other gods before me
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.600]   means don't prefer anything before me.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.200]   So the beginning of the 10 Commandments
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.920]   and the end of the 10 Commandments
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   are, I think, stating the essence of evil
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.400]   which underlies all the other evils
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.360]   that we have to turn away from inside the 10 Commandments,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.960]   and the essence of that evil is wanting,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.720]   preserving, preferring, desiring something
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   that would cause God to look less than supremely valuable.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.440]   So we start with God, He's good.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.520]   Yes, He's good.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.880]   By what standard is He good?
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.180]   By Himself, His own value.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.460]   So God's moral goodness is always acting in harmony
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.920]   with His infinite value,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.320]   and therefore our good is acting in harmony
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.600]   with His infinite value,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.960]   or the essence of evil is feeling or thinking
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.480]   or speaking in any way at all
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.400]   that would make God treat God
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.720]   as though He were not supremely valuable.
