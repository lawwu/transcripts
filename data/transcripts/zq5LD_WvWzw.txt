[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   In a recent Christianity Today article titled "Flipping the 40-Minute Sermon," the author's
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.280]   argument goes like this.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.200]   Attention spans have shriveled and what we think of as a sermonic monologue should be
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.900]   split up and pastors should actually do their main teaching online in bite-sized segments
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.280]   throughout the week and use the gathered church on Sundays as a place to foster personal interaction
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.020]   and fellowship.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.360]   Pastor John, what do you think of flipping the 40-minute sermon, of making the sermon
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.960]   less significant or insignificant on Sundays?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.440]   Well interesting that you should ask that because Bob Glenn, my friend out at Redeemer
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.720]   Bible Church, sent me a notice about this article.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   So I read it and he wanted to know what I thought and I had just in fact listened to
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.100]   a 40-minute, a great 40-minute message from Bob on Hosea so I could see why he was concerned
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.100]   about this.
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.440]   I wrote him, I said, "Oh Bob, this suggestion rolls around every 20 years or so.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.240]   Oh poor sermon on life support.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.280]   The sermon's days are numbered.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.600]   Let's all get participatory."
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.200]   I get weary frankly of these kinds of suggestions for sermons.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.720]   But here's the main problem.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.760]   The author of that article I think is committing a category confusion.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.200]   He was comparing the sermon to the lecture method of teaching in a college class compared
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.720]   to what happens in a more Socratic or participatory method.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.840]   And I agree with that.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.200]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.560]   When I teach in college or in seminary, I don't want to mainly lecture.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.320]   I want to teach by forcing students to ask questions, to think for themselves.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.320]   But here's the catch.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.240]   The sermon in the context of worship is not a lecture.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.640]   Worship is not a classroom.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.120]   The category for thinking about it is not pedagogical.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.520]   It's not educative.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.600]   Those are secondary.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   Pedagogy and education are secondary in the worship service.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.560]   The category is supernatural encounter with the living God as the preacher worships over
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.640]   the Word and draws the people into an experience of God Almighty through His proclamation.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.040]   That's the category.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.360]   And if you try to just replace that category with a lecture category, then her argument
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   is going to make sense.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.320]   All we're trying to do here is improve people's understanding of some theological truths.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.720]   Well, that's just not the main point of preaching.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.280]   So the aim of preaching is not first education but encounter.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.400]   Second Timothy 4.2 says to Timothy, "Preach the Word."
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.960]   And the context is one of worship there.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.760]   It's one of the people of God, not just proclamation to the world, but the people of God.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.440]   "Keruxon ton logon," and a kerux is not a teacher.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.760]   A kerux is a herald, a town crier.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:25.280]   So sermons are, "Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, the King of the universe has a message.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.160]   Everyone who bows the knee to Him will be forgiven all their sins and there will be
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.800]   a treaty and they will be free to be a part of the King's kingdom evermore."
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   You announce.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.760]   You don't first explain.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.240]   Now, if a little child comes up to you and says, "I don't know what the word 'treaty'
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.440]   means," then you're going to explain that.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.520]   And you might explain it in the sermon itself.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.440]   But the explanation is secondary.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.920]   The announcement, the heralding, the proclamation of the living God, calling His people to the
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.720]   fullest enjoyment of His kingdom is the main purpose of the sermon.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.320]   I call it "expository exaltation."
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.440]   That's with a "u," exaltation.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.600]   I'm exalting in God over His Word, and I'm drawing people into my exaltation over the
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.800]   truth that I'm preaching.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.520]   And there are other times, Tony, in the church when what this author was commending is exactly
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.520]   what should happen.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   There should be lots and lots of discussion and lots of provocative back and forth and
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.880]   lots of testing and proving and wrestling and struggling.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.520]   That's what classes are for and seminars are for and conferences are for and small groups
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.520]   are for.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:01.840]   And it's just sad that anyone would suggest that this one hour or hour and a half a week
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.120]   in which we as a collective people gather to stand before the living God and lift our
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.400]   voices in praise to Him, confess our sins, and hear Him powerfully address us through
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.800]   the voice of an anointed person, that that would be replaced somehow by all the other
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.960]   good things that are happening in the church.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.040]   So my response is, let preaching be preaching.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.840]   Let it be expository exaltation, a profound meeting with the living God.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   Very good.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.800]   And so does this mean that there's something missing when we listen to a 40-minute sermon
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.760]   through earbuds, through an iPhone, and we're not with the gathered local church?
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   It is, but I would say this.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:54.020]   The nature of that expository exaltation does not cease to be that when it's listened to
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.560]   on the internet.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.680]   It still is that, and a person can be drawn into that kind of heralding.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:11.760]   Yes, you can't reproduce the actual collection of the people of God gathered in that moment
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:20.300]   of worship there, but that doesn't mean that the only kind of communication that should
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:29.440]   happen through the internet is a more teaching or pedagogically back-and-forth kind of effort,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:37.420]   because expository exaltation really is a man in a worship setting exalting, worshiping
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.320]   over a text, and that kind of encounter with the living God can come through that medium.
