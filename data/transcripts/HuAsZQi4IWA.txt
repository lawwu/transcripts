[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.020]   - Well, today we look at parenting,
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.560]   particularly parenting through the teen years.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.260]   Parenting teens is full of pressures and challenges,
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.120]   and one source of those pressures are the demands
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.980]   and the questions put on mom and dad,
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.380]   for which there are no easy answers.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.880]   We're trying to help our teens think for themselves
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.560]   with discernment in a very complex world,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.720]   and it is one of the pressures that Pastor John
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.560]   has identified as a trigger in men
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.840]   of what we call a midlife crisis,
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.040]   a crisis that often hits a dad in his early 40s
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160]   when he has teens at home.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.840]   We saw that connection in APJ 1173.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   Dads as leaders bear a particular calling to their homes
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.380]   of self-sacrificing leadership,
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.440]   all to avoid giving the devil a foothold in our homes.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.000]   Ephesians 4, 26 and 27 raises the stakes that high
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.200]   when it commands us, quote, "Be angry and do not sin.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.880]   "Do not let the sun go down on your anger
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   "and give no opportunity to the devil," end quote.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.920]   High stakes.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.640]   In a 2007 sermon on this text,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.800]   Pastor John spoke directly to dads of teens.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.500]   He began with a word on modesty,
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.480]   but then transitioned to talk about a dad's hardest role
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.680]   in parenting teenagers.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.760]   "There are spiritual dangers, brothers,
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.400]   "coming at our families from every side today,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.280]   "innumerable and subtle.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.080]   "We need valiant warriors as never before,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.440]   "but not with spears and shield,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.760]   "but with biblical discernment and courage.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   "Husbands, pray for your wife and children
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.160]   "every day without fail,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.700]   "over and over again during the day.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.620]   "Protect them, protect them.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.760]   "Lead them in paths of righteousness.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.960]   "Don't let them go into temptation.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.680]   "Guard their lives, make their marriages work,
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.260]   "make their children strong, protect them.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.640]   "Oh my God, that's your job,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.100]   "to call down from God, hour by hour,
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.760]   "blessing on this family.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.120]   "That's what headship means."
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.040]   Prayer for them.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.240]   Then set standards for your wife and children.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.640]   Work them through with your wife.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.560]   Here again, primary responsibility means
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.280]   talk to her about it.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.160]   She's probably got some better ideas than you,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.080]   but taking initiative to talk is what she so longs for.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.760]   Women are not eager to be dominated.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   They're eager for their husbands to take initiative
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.480]   to make things happen in the moral sphere of their marriage.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.960]   Would you please help me set some standards for these kids
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.920]   and then help me carry this through?
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.520]   She shouldn't have to say that.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.640]   She wants you to step up.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.560]   Let's do this together.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.600]   Take some initiative.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.120]   We gotta figure out what this kid's gonna watch on TV.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.560]   We gotta figure out what movies they're gonna go to.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.040]   We gotta figure out what music is coming into this house,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.160]   and we gotta figure out how low that neckline is going.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.560]   And that's mainly your job, Dad.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.320]   Now on that last one, I'm fully aware
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.080]   that it is mainly mom and daughter
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   that work that out from age two months to 22.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   However, Dad, they desperately need your input on this.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.760]   They need you to celebrate when they get it right
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.920]   and look beautiful and modest.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.960]   And they need you to say,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.440]   "You're not going out of the house with that on."
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.600]   Here's another one.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.280]   The Bible is very clear
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.080]   about one of the most dangerous intruders
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.920]   spiritually in the family.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.360]   Let me read it to you from Ephesians 4, 26.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.800]   "Do not let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000]   Give no opportunity to the devil."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.520]   How is the devil allowed into a teenager's bedroom?
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.600]   How is the devil allowed at night
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.120]   into a married couple's bedroom?
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.600]   Answer, when they go to bed angry.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.720]   If you go to bed angry night after night after night,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.400]   that kid's seething at you in there
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.920]   and no steps at reconciliation have happened,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.000]   the devil, the door, he just thrown open wide.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.360]   And the havoc he can wreak over weeks, months, and years
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.560]   to destroy a soul, a marriage, and a family is awesome.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.840]   So what are you gonna do?
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   I'll tell you, Dad, this is where headship is so hard
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.440]   no woman would ever want it.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.800]   This is the hardest thing in the world.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   Headship means you must initiate reconciliation.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.400]   No matter how many times it's been her fault
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.360]   or the kid's fault, you have not the luxury as head
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.120]   to say, "She did it, and if she doesn't say she's sorry,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.320]   I'm hitting the pillow."
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.280]   No way.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.880]   Justice might say, "Yes, that's the right way to act."
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.200]   But let me ask you this,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.920]   is that the way Jesus treated his bride?
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   How many times has he come back to her and back to her?
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.320]   You, you, how many times he come back to you
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.480]   and back to you and back to you and back to you
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.600]   saying, "Here I am, ready to make up."
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.560]   A thousand times, 70 times, seven times, seven times,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   seven he has come back to you
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.840]   when it's your fault and not his.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.920]   And he took the initiative to make it right.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.520]   He died to make it right.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.760]   Will we husbands say, "It's her turn."
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.800]   Yes, we will, without the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.080]   This is impossible without Christ.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.800]   You don't wanna be heads, women,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.080]   because I'm holding the men accountable
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.280]   that this family not go to bed angry at night.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.840]   You knock on that teenager's door.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.760]   Oh, this can be sweet brothers.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.600]   This is as hard as it gets.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   You knock on that door
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.800]   and any little increment of fault that you bear
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.160]   over against his many faults, you confess it.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:28.760]   Not many things will break a teenager, but that might.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   To walk in and say, "Son,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.280]   my reaction to what you did was over the top.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.320]   What you did was wrong.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.080]   That's not the issue here.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.920]   But my reaction to it was over the top.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.640]   I wanna apologize and say, it wasn't in love.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.320]   I just got out of control and I'm sorry.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.400]   And I'd like you to forgive me."
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   You talk about sweet sleep.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.760]   You talk about healing balms in the mind and the soul, dads.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.320]   Now I'm not naive.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.160]   Good night.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.400]   I've been married 38 years.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.720]   There are attempts at peace that don't work, all right?
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.160]   But you've got to try.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   You get down on your knees.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.200]   Noelle and I have knelt beside each other
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.400]   and we haven't hardly been able to pray.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.880]   We just kneel there in silence.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.960]   Who's gonna pray first?
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.080]   Neither of us feel like praying.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.800]   We're so upset and these hinder your prayers big time.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.560]   And you can just eke out, "God, help us.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.160]   I want it to be better."
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.640]   It's your job, dad.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.320]   Hardest thing in the world.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.120]   Keep the devil out of the bedroom
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.160]   and out of the kids' rooms
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.880]   by not letting the sun go down on your anger
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.960]   in as much as it lies within you.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.560]   - The hardest thing in the world,
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.520]   initiating reconciliation.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.960]   Strong words, strong urgency,
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.600]   strong encouragement for all dads of teens.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   That was from a 2007 sermon titled,
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.280]   "Lionhearted and Lamb-like,
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.840]   What Does It Mean to Lead, Part Two?"
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.680]   You can find the full message at desiringgod.org.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.720]   And this episode on anger reminds me
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.800]   of an episode from 2017.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.480]   We recorded where Pastor John said, quote,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.240]   "Anger kills marriages way more often
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.240]   than sexual misconduct does," end quote.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.360]   I remember that one.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.120]   If you've been listening since 2017,
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.280]   you might remember that episode.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.160]   That was an episode called, "The Great Marriage Killer,"
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.480]   ABJ 1100, back in 2017.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   You can find ABJ 1100 at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.240]   Maybe you were not listening in 2017,
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.040]   but if you've been listening for the past 18 months or so,
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.120]   you might remember ABJ 1699,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.040]   "Why Did God Make Me Unattractive?"
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.720]   That became a fairly popular episode
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.920]   and it generated quite a lot of follow-up questions,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.480]   including one we will field next time.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.400]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.520]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.440]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.300]   you
