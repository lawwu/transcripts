[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Is the Calvinist-Arminian debate overblown?
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.900]   It's a question today from a young man, a listener to the podcast, who writes in to
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.120]   ask us this.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.320]   "Hello Pastor John, I've argued about predestination and free will with fellow believers for years.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.160]   I'm a five-point Calvinist myself, but lately these conversations have grown tiresome to
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   me.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.720]   No amount of debate seems to settle all the questions, and I recently read a letter by
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.600]   C.S. Lewis where he called the Calvinist-Arminian debate pretty much pointless because it only
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.520]   answers questions about this life, answers meaningless in eternity."
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.720]   Lewis wrote this, "Both the statement that our final destination is already settled,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.800]   Calvinism, and the view that it still may be either heaven or hell, Arminianism, seem
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.040]   to me to imply the ultimate reality of time, which I don't believe in.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.520]   The controversy is one I can't join on either side, for I think that in the real, timeless
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.120]   world it is meaningless."
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.560]   Pastor John, I think Lewis raises a fair question here.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.600]   Is this whole debate time-bound?
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.680]   And even within time, I find myself more and more asking, what is the real-life fallout?
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.520]   Is the practical and spiritual value of Calvinism for this life significantly better?
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.600]   And if so, how?
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.960]   Oh, Lewis, Lewis, Lewis, my friend, my mentor.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.120]   Let's start here.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.520]   There is a huge difference between saying on the one hand, "Fruitless debates have
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.480]   grown tiresome," which I can totally understand and would not encourage, and saying on the
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.280]   other hand, "I'm not seeing the real-life fallout or the practical spiritual value of
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.800]   Calvinism in this life."
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.720]   Those are radically different sentences, and the last one is tragic, tragic.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.280]   And I hope such a theological, personal malaise doesn't fall on me, and I hope it can be lifted
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.680]   from our young friend.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.880]   So first a word about Lewis, bless his heart and rest his soul in heaven, and then about
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.720]   Calvinism and time—that's the issue that he raised, time—and as I go along, I will
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.240]   try to show for our friend the preciousness of these things.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.160]   I have read more of C.S. Lewis than any other author on the planet except Jonathan Edwards.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.540]   I love C.S. Lewis.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.600]   He has made a great difference in my life.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.080]   But one thing you will look for in vain in all the writings of C.S. Lewis, and that is
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.920]   careful, serious, biblical exposition.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.520]   We have no idea how he did it.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.360]   I presume he did it.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.600]   We have to guess how C.S. Lewis read his Bible, because he does not show us, which means he
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.440]   comes at biblical theological questions more philosophically than he does exegetically.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.280]   This is certainly the case when it comes to Calvinism versus Arminianism.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:30.440]   As far as I can tell, he simply sweeps aside dozens of specific, clear, biblical sentences
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.200]   with the philosophical wand of timelessness.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.640]   Anybody who reads the Bible carefully and seeks to submit to the Bible's own logic—not
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560]   an alien philosophical presupposition, but seeks to submit to the Bible's own logic—will
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.840]   be content with Lewis's way of handling the issue of Calvinism and Arminianism.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.680]   It cannot satisfy if you are a Bible-saturated person who takes sentences, real, live, meaning-carrying
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.480]   sentences seriously when you read the Bible.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.160]   Here's what I would say to Lewis.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.840]   Let's just pretend that I'm now talking to C.S. Lewis about the five points of Calvinism.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.480]   Four of them, I would say, Mr. Lewis, four of them do not address the time issue at all.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.060]   And the fifth one addresses the time issue because God made it address the time issue.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.640]   God put the "pre" in predestination.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.360]   Man didn't decide to do that.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   God did that.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.880]   And he had good reasons for doing it, not to be swept away by the wand of timelessness.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.160]   So let me take them one at a time.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.500]   Total depravity.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.440]   The issue is, at the point of my conversion, was I dead?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.400]   Was I dead?
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.080]   Was I utterly incapable of seeing or savoring Jesus Christ as my supreme treasure?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.720]   Answer, yes, I was.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.400]   I was dead, blind, spiritually incapable of believing on Jesus.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.240]   First Corinthians 2.14, the natural person, that John Piper, does not accept the things
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.240]   of the Spirit of God.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.760]   No way, I'm stiff in arm and totally in my deadness and fallenness and blindness.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.400]   They are folly to me.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.600]   I'm not able to understand them.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.560]   They are spiritually discerned, and I don't have the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.480]   I hate God, and I love myself, and I am in bondage.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.120]   And the question is not one of time.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.800]   And the answer makes all the difference in the world about whether you praise yourself
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.920]   or praise your God in speechless wonder that you are now a lover of Jesus, that you can
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.520]   see the light of the glory of the gospel.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.800]   John Piper now sees the light of the glory of the gospel.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.980]   How did that happen?
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.400]   If you think you were only partially incapable of faith and just needed a little divine nudge,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.600]   your amazement, your humility, your worship, your reverence will be hindered.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.280]   How dead and how helpless were you when God saved you?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.360]   Come on, Lewis, come on.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.560]   Talk about First Corinthians 2.14.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.120]   Talk about Romans 8.7.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.680]   Talk about Ephesians 2.4.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.680]   Talk about Second Corinthians 4.4.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.760]   Give me your philosophical wand of timelessness.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.120]   Talk to me about the deadness of the human soul.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   That's number one.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.480]   Number two, irresistible grace.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:40.920]   The question, Mr. Lewis, is what happened on that bus ride that you described in "Surprised
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   by Joy," the one that you began as an unbeliever, and to your own amazement, you ended as a
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   believer?
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   What happened?
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.520]   The Bible is not silent about what happened.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.920]   It is not left to your philosophical speculation.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.160]   It goes like this.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   The God who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," shone in your heart to give the
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.960]   light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ, Second Corinthians
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.120]   4.6.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.000]   God did a creative miracle in your life, Mr. Lewis, just as much as when he called the
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.340]   universe out of nothing.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.400]   He took out the heart of stone and put in the heart of flesh.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   He raised you from the dead and seated you in the heavenly places with Christ.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.320]   He opened your eyes to give heed to the truth.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:36.880]   And in the very moment when you passed from death to life, God was decisive, not you.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.000]   You did not impart life to your dead self.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.880]   This is not an issue of time, Mr. Lewis.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.560]   This is an issue of worship.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.780]   To whom will you give glory for your decisive passage from unbelieving death to believing
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.780]   life?
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.380]   Number three, limited atonement, or better, definite atonement.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.820]   Here the question is not time.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:07.340]   The question is whether the new covenant miracle that happens to every Christian when their
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:13.100]   dead heart, our dead heart, is replaced with a new heart, whether that new covenant miracle
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:21.340]   was definitely purchased for them by the death of Christ, but was not so purchased for everyone.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.740]   That's the issue.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.580]   Or everyone would have a new heart if it was purchased that way for everyone.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.540]   Jesus called his blood the blood of the covenant, Matthew 26, 28.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.940]   The new covenant, he called it the new covenant, Luke 22, 20.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.780]   And what the new covenant promised was that the old unbelieving rebellious heart of C.S.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:47.500]   Lewis and John Piper would be replaced by God sovereignly with a new soft believing
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:53.660]   heart and that the law of God would be written—we don't write it, he wrote it—on that heart
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:59.940]   so that we do from the heart what we're called to do, like believe and obey.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.260]   This was all secured when we were purchased by the blood of the new covenant.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:13.860]   When Christ died, he secured a perfect, complete redemption, including the undeserved mercy
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.420]   of our conversion and faith.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.700]   This is not a question of time.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.480]   This is a question of what Christ achieved for his people on the cross.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.200]   Did he lay down his life for the sheep, John 10, 11?
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.940]   Did he ransom the children of God, John 11, 52?
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:38.580]   Did he ransom for himself a people scattered among the peoples, Revelation 5, 9, 10?
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.580]   Or didn't he?
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.580]   That's the issue.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.940]   Number four, perseverance of the saints.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.860]   This is not a question of timelessness or time.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:56.140]   This is a question about whether you and I will wake up a believer tomorrow morning.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.140]   Will I?
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.180]   And I cannot imagine, for our young friend, by the way, who wrote in this question, I
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.900]   cannot imagine anything more immediately relevant to me when I go to bed at night or think about
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:13.780]   it all day long than the answer to the question, "Will I wake up a believer, heaven bound,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.420]   tomorrow morning, or won't I?"
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:25.540]   Jude is so blown away by the glory of God's sovereign keeping, keeping, that the greatest
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:35.120]   doxology in the Bible is crafted to extol this work of God's sovereignty over our fickle
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.080]   free will, so-called.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.260]   If God left me to my fickle free will, I'd be out of here, prone to wander.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.420]   Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love, take my heart, oh Lord, and seal it,
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.820]   chain it, bind it, keep me.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:57.140]   So here's what Jude says, "Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, keep you,
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.940]   and to present you blameless."
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.820]   He's going to keep you and present you blameless, sovereignly.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.180]   Yes, if He doesn't do it, it isn't going to happen.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:12.060]   And then he says, "To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:18.020]   majesty and dominion and authority forever and ever, amen."
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.900]   That's how amazed Jude was that God would not let him go.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.360]   God wouldn't let him fall into unbelief.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.000]   God would not let his vaunted free will have the last word.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.380]   This is not a matter of time.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:42.100]   This is a matter of sweet assurance that tomorrow morning I will wake up with a heart for God.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.380]   Lastly, unconditional election.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.300]   Here we meet time, Ephesians 1, 4.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:57.380]   He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.380]   before Him.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.500]   In love He predestined us, predestined us.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.780]   So before the foundation of the world, predestined us for adoption.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:13.900]   In love He predestined us for adoption, predestined us to Himself as sons through Jesus Christ
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:19.700]   according to the purpose of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:27.740]   Paul's aim here is to inflame the praise of the glory of the grace of God.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.740]   That's his purpose.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.260]   That's the goal of these three verses, 4, 5, 6.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:40.260]   The sovereign, saving grace of God that is based not on our so-called free will but on
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.260]   the "purpose of His will."
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:54.720]   Paul intends to put God's saving grace outside our control so that when all history is said
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:02.980]   and done, the song of the ages will be, "To the praise of the glory of God's free, invincible
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:09.900]   grace," so that no human might boast except in the Lord.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:21.140]   And I would just say in closing that if these five realities are not humbling, emboldening,
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:33.900]   stabilizing, worship-inflaming, sacrifice-empowering, joy-igniting, what we ought to do is not ignore
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:43.020]   them, but get on our knees and cry out for the eyes of our heart to be opened.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.780]   Glorious and amazing biblical realities.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.540]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.340]   It's so good to rehearse those five points of Calvinism, as they're called.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.420]   And speaking of how Calvinism shows its impact practically in this life, see Pastor John's
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.940]   2002 article titled "Ten Effects of Believing in the Five Points of Calvinism."
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.340]   It's "Ten Effects of Believing in the Five Points of Calvinism."
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.580]   And speaking of the Calvinism of C.S.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.180]   Lewis, there's a lot more to say on this topic.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.540]   See Doug Wilson's plenary session at our 2013 National Conference.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.940]   That session was titled "The Romantic Rationalist, God, Life, and Imagination in the Work of
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.940]   C.S.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.940]   Lewis."
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.940]   Worth checking out the article, the session, both of which can be found at DesiringGod.org.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.620]   Thanks for listening.

[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:50.580]   Well, 1 John 5:12 tells us this, "Whoever has the Son has life, and whoever does not
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.420]   have the Son of God does not have life."
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.460]   But what exactly does it mean to have the Son of God?
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.020]   How do we come into possession of Jesus?
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.020]   That's what we will look at next time on Wednesday.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.020]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.660]   We'll see you then.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.660]   [End]
