[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   It is heartbreaking to read emails from disheartened wives like this one from a
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.920]   listener named Stephanie. Hello Pastor John. Thank you for this edifying podcast.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.760]   In reference to episode 1301, "Prioritizing Marriage Over Work" and the
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.200]   older episode about husbands leading their wives, "Oh how I long to be led by
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.760]   my husband in the ways that you describe, but he's not there." I have hoped and
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.600]   prayed for it and asked of it from him for many years now. I want to pray
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.840]   together regularly, have husband and wife meetings, spiritual goals, and many other
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.440]   important things involved in stewarding a family, but I feel like I'm pulling a
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.760]   ship up a mountain. He wants to take life easy and enjoys TV and sports. I long for
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.560]   deeper things. I recognize it's not my job or in my control to change him. I've
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.200]   been married for 14 years now. What would you say to me, Pastor John, a waiting wife?
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:07.680]   It's really significant when Stephanie says, "I realize it's not my job or in my
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.440]   control to change him." Now, mainly I want to agree with that, but not entirely. So
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.560]   let me give the qualification and then circle back to agree with her. My
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.880]   agreement is that she's right. In the end, only God can go deep with her husband
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.640]   and awaken the kinds of longings and passions that she is eager to see. I
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.920]   think her impulse is right that efforts to change a husband usually backfire
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.920]   because he may so easily interpret your efforts as making him a project or
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.320]   treating him like a child or oppressing him with endless disapproval, none of
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.000]   which produce what you long for. But it's not quite right to say, "It's not my job
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.200]   to change him." And the reason I say that is because 1 Peter 3 1 2 say, "Wives,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.440]   be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the Word, they
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.760]   may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives when they see your
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.480]   respectful and pure conduct." So Peter is telling these wives to make it their hope
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.080]   and aim and prayer to change their husbands into believers. That's what they
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.320]   want. Do it. So that. Live this way so that. Of course, that does not mean that
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.280]   it lies within a wife's power ultimately or decisively to convert her husband, but
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.040]   Peter isn't talking about what's ultimate and decisive. He's talking about
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.360]   what's secondary and possible, causes that really matter. God may use a wife's
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.160]   humble, godly, loving, supportive behavior to change a husband's willingness to
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.320]   hear the gospel and be safe. Now I think the same principle holds with regards to
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.800]   a husband's sanctification as well as his initial salvation. May God grant
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.360]   repentance. 2 Timothy 2 25. That's the initial and ongoing. God does
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.720]   it, but he uses means, and one of the means is how a wife lives and believes
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.320]   and loves to awaken him up. He may or he may not do it. God may grant repentance.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:42.640]   Now, Stephanie, however, is mainly right to be very cautious about thinking of
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.240]   her relationship to her husband as primarily calculated to change him. Her
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.200]   position is analogous, I would say, to a single woman who would like to be
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.720]   married, but her focus in life should be on living a productive, Christ-honoring,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.760]   single life rather than turning every situation into an effort to win a man.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.400]   That backfires. And so do marriages where the spouse thinks of every situation as
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.080]   calculated to bring about change in the other spouse. When Paul tells us how
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:31.160]   to love in 1 Corinthians 13 verses 4 to 7, he mentions 15 things that love
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.880]   does toward the beloved, say the spouse. Not one of them includes changing the
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.240]   other person. Here they are. Count them. Love is patient and kind. Love does not
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:54.000]   envy or boast. It is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way. It is
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.080]   not irritable or resentful. It does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:09.160]   the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:18.560]   endures all things. So let me be really sober-minded with Stephanie having seen
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:27.800]   marriages now for 70 years. I think you should go deep enough in your own soul
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:35.600]   and in the Word of God to realize your husband may never be the deep,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   spiritually strong leader you want him to be. You need to reckon with that. I think
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:51.520]   frankly that is the way most marriages go. 10, 20, 30 years in, you realize it's not
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:01.160]   turning out according to my dream. She or he isn't all I wanted, hoped for, or even
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.920]   think is right. It's just not happening. That's where most marriages are, I would
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:13.680]   say. This means that God's purpose for you is to refine and deepen your faith,
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.840]   your holiness, through the disappointing parts of your spouse's personality. I'm
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.000]   going to say that again. God's purpose for you is to refine and deepen your faith and
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.920]   your holiness through the disappointing parts of your spouse's personality. The
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:44.360]   fight of faith is to treat your spouse better and better out of the resources
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.800]   that you find in Christ. Paul said to the church in Thessalonica, "We urge you
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.760]   patient with them all." And it's very likely that the idle, the faint-hearted,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:14.160]   and the weak were married. That's the kind of spouse people had in that
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.480]   church. And if you meditate on those three words, especially in the Greek
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:27.640]   "idle"—undisciplined, disorderly, lazy; faint-hearted, small-souled, incapable of
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.320]   feeling large and great things with any attraction, easily discouraged, content
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.960]   with insignificant experiences; weak, vulnerable to something incapacitating,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.600]   debilitating, limitation—could be physical, could be mental. And Paul gives little
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.200]   indication in that verse that these kinds of people are going away. They will
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:58.480]   always be with us in the church, maybe in a family. We pray, we hope for growth. Not
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:05.200]   wrong. In fact, I think essential. We pray, we hope for growth. But the word to us is
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:16.480]   "be patient with them all." Love suffers long and is kind. How long? Well, the
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:24.680]   marriage vow says, "For better or for worse, as long as we both shall live." God
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.560]   will provide every grace you need to make your marriage the most fruitful
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.200]   place for growing in godliness. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for writing in
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.240]   this very difficult email, Stephanie. We appreciate that you're so honest with us
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.600]   and vulnerable with your email. Well, we are back on Friday to field a question
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.140]   about one of those really hard texts where Jesus talks about who will be
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.200]   excluded from the kingdom of heaven. Those are always difficult texts, very hard texts,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.000]   those kind of texts that get right in your face. That's coming up on Friday.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.720]   Until then, you can find now over 1,300 of our past episodes in our archive at
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.360]   our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn. I'm your host, Tony
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.680]   Reinke. We'll see you back here Friday.
