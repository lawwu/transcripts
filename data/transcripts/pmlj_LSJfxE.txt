[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720]   - Happy Monday, everyone.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.340]   We launch a new week and we close in on 1700 episodes
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.340]   in this podcast.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.600]   Thank you for your support and for your prayers
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.280]   and encouragements over the years.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.440]   And as we march forward,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.720]   I'm also investing some time curating the archives,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.360]   going back to notice where some of our content gaps remain.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.840]   And while doing so, Pastor John,
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.720]   I found one of those gaps, I think.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.880]   We have several episodes on fasting.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.000]   You know, what is fasting?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.840]   What does it mean?
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.660]   What does it accomplish?
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.500]   How do we do it?
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.680]   And so on.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.600]   But by contrast, we have relatively little on feasting.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.960]   And yet feasting is a major category in scripture,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.120]   far more prevalent in the Bible than fasting is actually.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.900]   So on this Monday, Pastor John,
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.000]   can you give us a little theology of feasting
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.240]   in 10 minutes as you understand it?
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.720]   (laughing)
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.880]   A little theology, 10 minutes.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.600]   Maybe the way to think about this episode on feasting
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.900]   is that the biblical points that I will make
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.400]   are the raw materials of a theology of feasting.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400]   That would make me feel a little bit better.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.640]   First, we need a definition.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.960]   I'm gonna start with a popular definition,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.120]   namely feasting is the enjoyment of abundance.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.320]   I'm gonna, that's my short-term definition.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.080]   I'm not even gonna say that it is limited
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.280]   to the enjoyment of food
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.860]   because you could feast your eyes on scenery,
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.940]   you could feast your ears on music,
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.040]   you could feast your nose on sweet aromas,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   you could feast your taste buds on honey,
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.080]   feast your skin and body on sexual pleasures.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.020]   So when you turn to the Bible,
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.820]   you find that the word feast
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.680]   does not always have this connotation
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.420]   even of abundance in view.
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.500]   The Old Testament is just full.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.820]   I mean, if you do a word search on the word feast
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.660]   in the Old Testament,
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.660]   it's just full of prescribed feasts,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.940]   they're called in English.
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.300]   And they include Passover,
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.980]   feast of first fruits,
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.820]   feast of weeks,
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.020]   feast of Pentecost,
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.980]   feast of trumpets,
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.820]   feast of booths.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.740]   And you can see these spelled out.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.980]   They take their beginning,
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.180]   like in Leviticus 23,
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.820]   and then they're unpacked all over the place.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.300]   They don't all imply abundance,
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.580]   but rather,
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.600]   so here'd be a modification of the definition biblically,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   a communal sharing of a celebrated meal
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.740]   with a focus on some remembrance
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.980]   and thankfulness of some event of God's mercy,
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.380]   something like that.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.480]   And it might be very simple.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.500]   I mean, unleavened bread is not what you think about
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.900]   when you think about a big Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.140]   So we need to be careful
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.980]   and be sure that when we see the word feast in the Bible,
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.900]   we determine from the context,
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.140]   whether it implies the enjoyment of abundance
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.940]   or something more simple,
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.540]   some celebration of some remembered event
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.060]   in a focused and communal and simple way.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.120]   But I'm gonna focus on what we ordinarily mean by feasting.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.960]   That's what I think you're really asking
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.480]   over against fasting,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.300]   namely a joyful shared experience of some abundance,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.660]   usually food and drink.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.420]   And so I have four observations as I look at the Bible
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.460]   about such feasting,
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.380]   the raw material maybe of a little theology of feasting.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.920]   First, the Bible is clear that feasting
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   in and of itself may be a very good thing or bad thing,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.140]   depending on other factors.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.980]   For example, Proverbs 17, one says,
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.740]   "Better is a dry morsel with quiet
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.300]   than a house full feasting with strife."
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.640]   In other words, mere abundance of food and drink
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.980]   does not make for a happy family or happy community.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.220]   There must be more to it.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.060]   Another example would be Ecclesiastes 10, 16,
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.840]   "Woe to you, O land,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.700]   when your princes feast in the morning."
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.580]   Happy are you, O land,
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.720]   when your princes feast at the proper time
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.460]   for strength and not for drunkenness.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.780]   In other words, there's a time for work
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.500]   and a time for feasting.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.080]   And there are good purposes for feasting,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.080]   and there are fleshly, worldly, sinful reasons for feasting.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.720]   Feasting in and of itself may or may not be good.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.040]   Another example, Ecclesiastes 7, 2,
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.260]   "It is better to go to the house of mourning
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.520]   than to the house of feasting,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.840]   for this is the end of all mankind
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.400]   and the living will lay it to heart."
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.320]   In other words, the good and rightful pleasures of feasting
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.940]   cannot teach you the deepest things about life and death.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.460]   I never heard anybody say they went deepest with God,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.460]   learned most of God on easy days or at feasting.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.100]   One more example, God says to Israel in Amos 5, 21,
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.340]   "I hate and despise your feasts.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.460]   Let justice roll down like waters
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.860]   and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream."
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.860]   In other words, if our feasting is a cloak of pleasure,
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.220]   covering lives of lovelessness and injustice,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.380]   the feast has become a stench in God's nose.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.240]   So those are examples of what I mean when I say
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.600]   feasting in and of itself may be a very good thing
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.820]   or bad thing, depending on other factors.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.820]   Observation number two, God intends that the abundance
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.160]   which he provides for our physical enjoyment,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.780]   the enjoyment of our senses,
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.780]   should echo in our hearts with thanksgiving to God
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.620]   and be made holy by the word and prayer.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.540]   I'm simply echoing 1 Timothy 6, 17,
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.860]   where Paul says we should set our hope on God
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.860]   who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.560]   In other words, the sights and sounds and smells
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   and tastes and touch of good things that God has made
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.680]   are not mainly tests to see if we will make them our God
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.880]   and become idolaters, but rather they are mainly pleasures
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.080]   to send our hearts joyful and thankful back to God.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.560]   That's their main purpose for existence.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.260]   Paul puts it like this in 1 Timothy 4, 4.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.420]   Everything created by God is good.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.300]   Nothing is to be rejected if it is received
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.300]   with thanksgiving, for it is made holy
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.180]   by the word of God and prayer.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.460]   So the difference between unholy feasting
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.480]   and holy feasting is not what's on the table,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.580]   but what's in the mind and in the heart.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.540]   Is the mind grasping the God-centered meaning
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.200]   of these things from the word of God?
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   And is the heart sending up joyful prayers of thanksgiving
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.740]   as we taste more of the goodness of God
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.400]   in the very things we're eating?
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.480]   Observation number three, one of the beautiful ways
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.060]   God describes the destiny of those
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.820]   who will accept salvation, his invitation,
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.700]   is a final feast with him in the age to come.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.840]   Isaiah 25, 6.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.100]   On this mountain, the Lord of hosts
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.100]   will make for all peoples a feast of rich food,
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.320]   a feast of well-aged wine,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.660]   and he will swallow up death forever.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.600]   That's a magnificent picture of our hope
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.660]   beyond this age, beyond the grave.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.780]   Jesus says in Matthew 22, 2,
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.740]   "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.500]   who gave a wedding feast for his son
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.740]   and sent out the invitation to the world,
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.300]   come to the wedding feast."
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.220]   That's what world missions is.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.020]   My book is called "Let the Nations Be Glad."
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.700]   It could be called "Let the Nations Come to a Feast."
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.500]   And to his disciples at the last supper,
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.220]   just before he gave his life for our sins,
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.000]   Jesus said in Luke 22, 29,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   "I assign you, as my father assigned to me,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.940]   a kingdom that you may eat and drink
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.160]   at my table in my kingdom."
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.280]   And the book of Revelation tops it off
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.220]   with the angel crying,
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.620]   "Blessed are those who are invited
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.340]   to the marriage supper of the Lamb,"
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.460]   to which I respond, "Blessed indeed
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.060]   to be a part of the bride of Christ on that day."
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.700]   One last observation, number four.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.700]   "In some measure now, then perfectly at the last day,
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.380]   God himself will be our feast."
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.060]   Psalm 36, 7.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.620]   "How precious is your steadfast love, O God.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.860]   The children of mankind feast
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.320]   on the abundance of your house,
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   and you give them drink from the river of your delights."
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.780]   I think if we meditate on those four observations
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.900]   about feasting from Scripture
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.100]   in the context of the whole Bible,
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.340]   we will be able to move wisely
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.540]   between fasting and feasting,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.900]   between the joy of self-denial
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.340]   and the joy of abundance
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.240]   in a way that shows the supreme value of Christ
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.900]   in our lives.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.900]   - Thank you, Pastor John, for these raw materials,
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.660]   these ingredients to cook up a theology of feasting.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.660]   I appreciate it.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.900]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.860]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.220]   You can search our growing archive
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.980]   and find all of our episodes on fasting
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.980]   or several other issues.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.420]   And you can subscribe to the podcast too.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.460]   You can do all of those things
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.940]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.060]   That's our online homepage,
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.260]   desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.820]   Well, next time we look at a family in crisis.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.100]   Husband and wife are at odds.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.660]   Son is pitted against father.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.100]   Daughter is pitted against mother.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.780]   Even the daughter-in-law sides
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.420]   with the daughter against mom.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.940]   And all those compounded animosities
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.500]   toward the mother weigh down on the father too
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.820]   until it appears that a man's enemies
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.460]   are in his own home.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.780]   So when a family breaks apart like this
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.580]   and crisis hits, what is a man to do?
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.140]   That's the topic next time.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.300]   and we will see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.140]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:45.960]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:12:01.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
