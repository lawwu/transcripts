[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.680]   The first day I taught my three children at home, I cleaned up the playroom and set up
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.640]   three desks. I hung an American flag at the front of the room and led them in the Pledge
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.240]   of Allegiance. I was shaking with nervousness. It was 1973 and my husband Jay and I had just
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.740]   done something radical. We had removed our children from school. I was terrified, which
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.040]   was ridiculous. After all, I was a state-certified teacher. I'd taught public school for six
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.600]   years. I'd taken post-graduate courses in education from Tulane University, the College
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.380]   of William & Mary, and the University of Virginia. One year, I'd managed 38 second graders from
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.600]   dawn till dusk. No lunch break, no recess break, and no teacher's aid. Yet, I was completely
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.000]   intimidated by those three little children, certain that I couldn't do an adequate job
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.280]   of teaching them myself. All my teacher education had brainwashed me. I was convinced that parents
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.620]   couldn't possibly teach their own children, certainly not at home. It had to be done in
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.720]   an institutional setting, run by professionals with their resources and specialized training
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.160]   and expertise. Unfortunately, the professionals had let us down. I wasn't a stranger to failures
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.000]   in the system. The last year I taught public school, I had in my sixth grade class two
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.700]   sixteen-year-old boys who had not yet learned to read. I'd never even heard of homeschooling,
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.140]   but I remember thinking, "If I ever have a child, he will know how to read before he
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.520]   goes to school. I will not have my son sitting in sixth grade unable to read." So, when my
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.440]   oldest child turned four, I said to him one day, "Bob, would you rather take a nap, or
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.960]   would you like to learn how to read?" He chose reading, not surprisingly, and I started him
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.560]   on the old-fashioned phonics I'd been taught when I was a child. I'd lie down with him
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.800]   on his little bed after lunch and work on his letters. Since I also had a two-year-old
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.200]   and a thirteen-month-old, I was always glad to lie down. We practiced vowels and consonants
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.080]   and sounded out new words that year. We called it "doing kindergarten." By the time my middle
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.920]   child was three, she wanted in. "Might I do kindergarten too?" she'd say, and I would
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.240]   boost her up and let her repeat the sounds after me. I was proud of myself. I was preparing
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.560]   my children for school. Kindergarten, when it came, was uneventful and purely social.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.160]   Bob loved to play at school. At home, I went on reading to him and teaching him his language
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.900]   and number skills. But when Bob reached first grade, he didn't fit in. He already knew the
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.440]   material and he was bored. The school, a well-regarded private school, was cooperative and moved
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.280]   him into second grade. He was bored there too. The class was working on early reading
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.720]   skills and we'd already done that. The second graders didn't like him because he was a little
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.640]   upstart invading their turf. The administration moved him back to first grade, but now the
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.600]   first graders were hostile. He was a big shot who'd been thought worthy of second grade
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.640]   and they wouldn't play with him. They were jealous because he was well-prepared. So,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.520]   here he was in first grade, already feeling that doing well in school made him unpopular.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.440]   He started to change. He had been an excited, exuberant, curious child. Now he was a behavior
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.720]   problem. He stopped doing well in school. His papers had always been meticulously done,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.680]   but suddenly his writing became sloppy. The teacher complained to us that Bob was always
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.840]   questioning her in class, and the bus ride to school was horrendous. The older kids made
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.040]   the younger ones sit on the floor, stole their lunches, and dirtied their clothes so they'd
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.920]   get demerits from the teachers at school. Every day, Bob got off the school bus with
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.220]   a handful of bad papers and he was either fighting mad or crying. At this point, Jay
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.120]   and I realized that we were spending most of our time with this child trying to undo
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.720]   what was happening to him when he was at school, and we were afraid that our second child,
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.840]   Susan, would go through the same metamorphosis. Susan had just started kindergarten, and the
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.880]   teacher was already protesting to us that she would be a social misfit because she wanted
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.080]   to read during free time instead of playing. We were experiencing firsthand the terrific
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.500]   leveling pressure applied in so many schools, the effort to smooth out the bumps by bringing
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   well-prepared kids down to the level of the rest. This still happens in some schools.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.360]   Just this year, the best private preschool in our area agreed to stop teaching four-year-olds
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.080]   beginning reading skills. Kindergarten teachers in the local public schools had complained
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   that the children turned out by this preschool were bored in kindergarten because they already
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.880]   knew the material. The schools demanded that the preschool quit turning out such well-prepared
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.080]   five-year-olds so that all the kindergartners would start at the same level of ignorance.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.480]   I was appalled when the preschool buckled and went back to teaching colors and "social
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.360]   skills." Back in 1973, no one had told me to stop teaching phonics to my preschoolers,
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.400]   and we didn't know what to do with these academic misfits I had managed to produce.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.600]   So we took our two school-age children to a psychologist in the local mental health
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.080]   system. He tested both of them, and I found out what my careful preparation for kindergarten
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.320]   had done. Bob, the second grader, was reading on a seventh grade level. Susan, the kindergartner,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.640]   was reading fifth grade material. Psychologist called us into his office afterward. "Listen,"
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.000]   he said, "if you keep those children in school, they are going to become non-learners.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.800]   They're bored to death. You've got a teacher's certificate. Why don't you take them out
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.520]   of school and teach them yourself?" This had never occurred to us. After all, education
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.880]   was the domain of schools, and these were our children. We didn't know anyone else
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.480]   who was homeschooling. The whole idea was odd and radical, and we weren't even sure
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.200]   it was even legal. Virginia law was fuzzy on this point.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.760]   But we had no other choice. The local public school was a terrible environment socially,
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.400]   and test scores ranked our county at the bottom of the state year after year. The private
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.160]   school had been our solution. So, quaking in my boots, I set up the desks and the American
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.000]   flag and started to teach my children at home. I worried the whole time. I worried that my
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.600]   children weren't going to get into college. I worried that the school system was going
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.240]   to come and take them away from us for neglect and truancy. I worried that their social development
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.980]   would suffer. I could tell you the stories of all three children, but I want to focus
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.000]   on my older daughter, Susan, because we've had the chance to work and speak together
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.920]   and to reflect on what I did right and wrong in her education.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.880]   As I write this, Susan is 35, happily married and the mother of four, three boys and a girl.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.840]   She went to college at 17 on a full scholarship, awarded to her for being a national merit
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.120]   finalist. She worked summers for a good salary as secretary for a legal firm. Her college
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.240]   chose her to spend a term at Oxford as a visiting student. After college, she completed a Master
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.380]   of Divinity, a three-year theological degree, and then a Master of Arts in English Literature.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:44.120]   She reads Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Aramaic, and French. She has a thriving career as a writer.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.200]   She has published novels and nonfiction books. She writes for several journals and periodicals,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.860]   and she has started her own small press. She is pursuing her doctoral degree in American
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.160]   Studies and teaches literature and writing at the College of William and Mary in Virginia.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.380]   As I look back on the education I gave her, I can see that it follows a pattern that has
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.000]   mostly disappeared from public education.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.680]   To begin with, I filled her head with facts when she was small. I taught her to read early
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.240]   and kept books everywhere in the house. We had books for presents and rewards, and I
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.480]   was known at the local public library as "the lady with the laundry basket" because I took
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.840]   my children in every week and filled a laundry basket with their books. On each library visit,
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.520]   I had them check out the following books. One science book. One history book. One art
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.720]   or music appreciation book. One practical book (a craft, hobby, or how-to). A biography
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   or autobiography. A classic novel (or an adaptation suited to age). An imaginative story book.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.440]   A book of poetry. They were allowed to choose the titles, but I asked them to follow this
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.120]   pattern. And they were also allowed to check out other books on any topic they pleased.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.840]   Furthermore, I made Susan memorize. She could recite multiplication tables, lists of linking
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.960]   verbs, dates, precedents, and Latin declensions.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.920]   As her thought processes matured, I taught her how to fit her knowledge into logical
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.200]   structures. I spent a lot of time with her in one-on-one discussion and interaction.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.640]   We learned spelling rules, mathematics, and basic logic. We followed an unfashionably
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.920]   strict grammar book and diagrammed sentences of increasing complexity. We kept science
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.040]   notebooks and timelines so that we could organize her growing knowledge of facts into logical
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.960]   and chronological order. I taught her how to organize a paragraph, an essay, a research
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.120]   paper. She learned Latin grammar. She learned how to discipline herself to follow a custom-made
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.560]   schedule, balancing academics and personal interests like music and creative writing.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.980]   And she continued to read every spare moment.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.800]   As she moved into high school, I spent more time working on her skills in writing and
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.920]   expression. She wrote papers, book reports, and stories. She had a particular bent for
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.720]   this and also wrote two novels, although that wasn't a part of my curriculum. My plan
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.160]   did include allowing her to develop a specialty, some area in which she could deepen her knowledge
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.280]   in preparation for college and a career. She became interested in early British history
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:24.360]   and literature and taught herself Welsh and Gaelic. She loved practicing the piano. She
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.560]   also started working part-time, and we spent an hour every day studying for her SATs, using
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.040]   test preparation books to review reading skills, logical constructs, English vocabulary, and
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   mathematics. She scored 740 on the verbal section of the SATs, 630 on the math, and
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.880]   this was before the new adjusted scoring came in.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.320]   Our mailbox was filled with college catalogs. She finally chose a school where she'd been
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.080]   offered a presidential scholarship based on her standardized scores. In her freshman year,
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.380]   she was given the chance to test out of several survey courses by taking the college-level
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.720]   examination program examinations. She took the whole battery, just for fun, and was awarded
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.080]   over 30 hours of college credit. After college, she made a perfect score on the verbal section
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.840]   of the graduate record exam and did her graduate work at William & Mary on full scholarship.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.200]   I didn't know until later that I had followed the pattern of classical education called
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.320]   the trivium. I did know that what I was doing worked.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   Susan will write about the trivium in the next chapter. It's the classical theory
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.920]   of education which organizes learning around the maturing capacity of the child's mind.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.460]   It no longer exists in public education. I didn't learn by this method when I was educated
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.560]   in the county public schools back in the 40s and 50s, but I was raised by elderly relatives
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.760]   who had been taught by classical methods popular before the turn of the century. Mimi, as I
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.600]   called her, had only finished 8th grade in a one-room schoolhouse, and Uncle Luther hadn't
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.640]   even gone that far. But by 8th grade, Mimi had learned Latin and algebra, and Uncle Luther
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.520]   had learned advanced practical mathematics and how to think and write. They taught me
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.760]   to read before I ever went to school. The first grade teacher was our neighbor, and
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.860]   when she heard that Mimi was drilling me in phonics, she made a special trip over to warn
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:18.840]   us that I'd be ruined for life if Mimi used such an outdated method. Mimi was undaunted,
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.000]   and when I did enter school, I was put straight into second grade because of the skills I'd
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.760]   already acquired. When I came home from school in the evenings, Mimi and Uncle Luther sat
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.680]   me down and made me learn. Mimi would point at the lists in the books, multiplication
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.300]   tables, parts of speech, and say, "Memorize those." "But the teacher said we don't have
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.120]   to memorize them," I protested. "We just have to be able to use them." "I don't care what
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.400]   the teacher says," Mimi insisted. "These are things you have to know." I had been trained
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.080]   to be obedient and disciplined, so I memorized the lists, even though memorization was difficult
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.040]   for me. I learned my algebra and grammar. I went on to college and a professional position.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.180]   I was the only girl in my high school class to graduate from college. When I had children
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.160]   of my own, I used Mimi's method and found that the three-part process of memorization,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.920]   logical organization, and clear expression put them far above their peers.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.880]   In the middle of this century, Dorothy Sayers, author and creator of Lord Peter Whimsey,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.240]   told an audience at Oxford University that education had given up on the trivium and
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.200]   was now running on what she called the "educational capital." We no longer teach our children
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.120]   the process of memorization, organization, and expression, the tools by which the mind
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.280]   learns. The leftover remnants of those methods have carried us through several decades of
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.760]   schooling without catastrophe. I made it through public school at the top of my class because
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.560]   my guardians taught me from what they had learned. But sooner or later, the capital
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.200]   gets used up. My own children were faced with teachers who brought them down to the level
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.140]   of the class, teachers who thought it was more important to teach social skills than
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.800]   academic subjects, textbooks that had abandoned grammatical rules and mathematical logic in
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.840]   favor of scattershot, incidental learning. They were surrounded by peers who considered
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   anyone good at learning to be a geek. They spent seven hours every day sitting in desks,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.700]   standing in lines, riding buses, and doing repetitive seat work so that their classmates
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.920]   could learn what they already knew. I wanted something better for them. As I've watched
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.520]   home education develop over the last two decades, I've become convinced that any dedicated
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:34.360]   parent can do what I did. My own education didn't stretch to Latin or Gaelic or Calculus
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.980]   or Computer Science or Art, but my children learned all of these things. With the help
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.480]   of resources and support groups now in place throughout the country, and with the principles
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.680]   we'll give you in this book, you can provide your child with a classical education at home,
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.640]   even if you've never glanced at Latin or Logic. You can do what my guardians did, and
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.720]   on your own time teach your child the basic skills she may not be learning at school.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.360]   Your young student may need particular help in math, science, reading, or writing. Even
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.120]   the best and most diligent teacher (I speak from experience) is often prevented from giving
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.880]   necessary individual attention by the growing size of her class. If you use the resources
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.640]   we've collected in this book and invest in some one-on-one time with your child, you
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.680]   are capable of educating him. When I taught school, I was convinced that parents couldn't
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:30.920]   teach their own children. But 25 years later, I can look back and say, the experiment was
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:37.520]   a success. I was the best teacher my children could possibly have had because I was their
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:43.200]   parent. I happened to have a teacher's certificate, but during my years of homeschooling I learned
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.340]   more academic material, more about how to manage individual relationships with children,
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.400]   and more about how to teach than I did in any of my teacher education courses. Teacher
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.200]   education courses gave me a great deal of good information on how to manage large groups
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.640]   of children. I needed that in schools, but a parent doesn't need it to teach at home.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.240]   I happened to have a college degree, but in the 25 years since I first became involved
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.280]   with the home education movement, I've seen parents who only finished high school lead
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.880]   their children successfully through 12th grade, and I've watched those children thrive in
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.320]   college. You shouldn't be afraid to take your child out of school, if necessary. This is
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   a radical step for most parents. It means a change in schedule, in priorities, in lifestyle.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:36.000]   And apart from academic concerns, many parents ask, "What about my child's social development?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.800]   Doesn't he need peers?" Children need friends. Children do not need to be surrounded by large
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   groups of peers who inevitably follow the strongest personality in the crowd. The question
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.320]   for any parent is, "Do I want my child to be like his peers, or do I want my child to
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.160]   rise above them?" Finally, if you're accustomed to sending your child to school every morning
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.440]   and allowing the professionals to worry about what he learns and how he learns it, the idea
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.920]   of supervising an entire education may overwhelm you. I sympathize. When I started, I was convinced
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.840]   I could never do it. But if you feel your child is being short-changed in school, we
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.360]   can give you a plan to fix that. In this book, not only will we introduce you to the Trivium
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.080]   Method, but we'll give you resources to carry it out, and a plan for the entire 12 years
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.520]   of school. I discovered that home education has a great advantage I knew nothing about
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.680]   when I started. Home education teaches children to learn, and eventually to teach themselves.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.660]   By the time my children were 12 or so, I did less and less actual teaching. I supervised,
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:46.120]   I discussed content with them, I held them accountable, I graded, I bought books and
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.560]   organized coursework. But by early high school, they had been trained in the methods of learning.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.440]   From this point, they began the process of educating themselves, with some help from
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.600]   tutors and correspondence courses. As adults, they continued to educate themselves, to widen
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:10.160]   their intellectual horizons. Certainly, this should be the first goal of education.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:19.520]   What I've just read you is the prologue written by Jessie Wise in the excellent book co-authored
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.520]   by Jessie Wise and her daughter Susan Wise Bower, called "The Well-Trained Mind, A Guide
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:33.000]   to Classical Education at Home." I hope that essay inspires and encourages you based upon
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.720]   what is possible.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:41.320]   A personal look at classical education. Susan, I loved going to school at home. As a high
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.720]   school student, I would get up in the morning, practice the piano for two hours, do my math
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.100]   and grammar lessons, finish off my science, and then devote the rest of my school day
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.720]   to my favorite subjects, history, ancient languages, and writing. Once a week, we all
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:02.120]   piled into the car and drove around to music lessons, math tutoring sessions, library visits,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:08.280]   college classes. On weekends, we went to athletic meets, my brother's bicycle races, the horse
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.000]   shows my sister and I trained for, and rode in. But I was nervous when I went away to
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.360]   college. Although I had done well on standardized exams, I never really sat in a regular classroom,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.240]   facing inflexible deadlines. I was used to taking tests from my mother. I shouldn't
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.120]   have worried. I tested out of 30 hours worth of college courses. By my second semester,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:37.640]   I was taking 400 level courses. I had a host of strange skills. I could diagram sentences.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.920]   I could read Latin. I knew enough logic to tell whether an assertion was true or faulty.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.720]   And I was surrounded by 18-year-olds who couldn't write, didn't want to read, and couldn't
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.440]   reason. I worked in the peer tutoring center for two years, tutoring English composition
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:00.880]   and Greek grammar. I found myself teaching fifth grade grammar to college students. My
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.360]   peers came in because they were getting failing grades in composition. I discovered that they
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.660]   couldn't tell the difference between fragments and run-on sentences. Students of Greek came
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.200]   in because they were having trouble translating. They couldn't identify nouns and verbs or
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:23.040]   tell me what the difference was. This college was small and non-exclusive. But the problem
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.840]   is universal.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.040]   Ten years later, I taught my first semester of university classes at the College of William
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.080]   and Mary in Virginia. William and Mary, which still holds to the model of classical education,
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:40.120]   is selective about admissions. The students in my literature classes had high grades,
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.560]   high test scores, lots of extracurricular credits. I had 60 students my first year and
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:51.760]   taught two sections of major British writers, 18th and 19th centuries. Jonathan Swift to
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   Arthur Conan Doyle in one fell swoop. I spent the beginning of the semester teaching remedial
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.960]   English to these freshmen. My first hint of trouble came when I assigned Wordsworth's
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:09.040]   ode "Intimations of Immortality" and gave a reading quiz. As I collected the test, I
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:16.080]   saw that Wordsworth's title had been thoroughly mangled. "Intimissions" or "Intimimations"
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:22.240]   or "In-intimissions." "Didn't any of you learn phonetic spelling?" I asked. Most of
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.360]   them shook their heads. Well, I already knew that phonics tends to be unfashionable, so
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.400]   I decided to be merciful. After all, I thought, they can always run a spell checker on their
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:40.000]   papers. I told them to write a four to six-page paper comparing two of the poems we'd covered,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.480]   or comparing one of the poems to a modern work. No footnotes necessary, no research
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   into scholarly articles required. Almost at once, the email started to flood into my electronic
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.280]   mailbox. "Professor Bower, I never wrote a paper on a poem before and I don't know
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.680]   where to start." "Professor Bower, I want to write on 'The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner,'
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.680]   but I don't think I can say enough about it to fill up four pages." "The Rhyme of
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.400]   the Ancient Mariner" has enough metaphor and philosophy in it to provide material for
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.280]   a doctoral thesis. "While thinking about my paper topic, I've realized that I have
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.920]   no clue as to what I should write on." "Professor Bower, I'm completely lost. I only have delusions
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:23.920]   of correct paper topics." The papers, when finally turned in, contained a few gems, but
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.720]   the majority were badly written, illogical, and full of grammatical errors. And with a
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.800]   few exceptions, my privately educated students struggled right along with the public school
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.920]   graduates. They labored to put a thesis into words. They sweated and complained and groaned
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.360]   trying to prove it, and they didn't know whether they'd proved it or not when they
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.880]   got to the end of their paper. I spend time talking to these freshmen and sophomores in
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:54.680]   my office. They're bright, lively, energetic, interesting kids. They have ideas and passions
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.520]   and philosophical problems and social concerns and creative aspirations, but they've been
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.920]   done a great disservice. Their schools gave them few tools. Their minds are filled with
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:11.240]   the raw materials needed for success, but they're having to dig with their hands. I
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.840]   was ahead of them when I was their age, not because of superior mental abilities, but
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.600]   because I'd been equipped with a closet full of mental tools. My mother taught us the way
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:29.120]   she'd been taught at home. Our education was language-centered, not image-centered.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:35.600]   We read and listened and wrote, but we rarely watched. She spent the early years of school
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.260]   giving us facts, systematically laying the foundation for advanced study. She taught
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:46.640]   us to think through arguments, and then she taught us how to express ourselves. This is
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.880]   the classical pattern of the trivium, the three-part process of training the mind. The
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.900]   first years of schooling are called the "grammar stage," not because you spend four years
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.280]   doing English, but because these are the years in which the building blocks for all other
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.480]   learning are laid, just as grammar is the foundation for language.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:13.520]   In the elementary school years, grades 1 through 4, the mind is ready to absorb information.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.140]   Since children at this age actually find memorization fun, during this period education involves
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:25.720]   not self-expression and self-discovery, but rather the learning of facts, rules of phonics
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.360]   and spelling, rules of grammar, poems, the vocabulary of foreign languages, the stories
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.800]   of history and literature, descriptions of plants and animals and the human body, the
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:41.520]   facts of mathematics, the list goes on. This information makes up the "grammar" for
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:49.280]   the second stage of education. By fifth grade, a child's mind begins to think more analytically.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.360]   Middle school students are less interested in finding out facts than in asking "why?"
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:00.000]   The second phase of the "classical education," the "logic stage," is a time when the child
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.280]   begins to pay attention to cause and effect, to the relationships among different fields
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.480]   of knowledge, to the way facts fit together into a logical framework.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.900]   A student is ready for the "logic stage" when the capacity for abstract thought begins
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:20.240]   to mature. During these years, the student learns algebra and logic, and begins to apply
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.000]   logic to all academic subjects. The logic of writing, for example, includes paragraph
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.160]   construction and support of a thesis. The logic of reading involves the criticism and
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:37.680]   analysis of texts, not simple absorption of information. The logic of history demands
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.560]   that the student find out why the War of 1812 was fought, rather than simply reading its
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.600]   story. The logic of science requires the child to learn the scientific method.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.360]   The final phase of a classical education, the "rhetoric stage," builds on the first
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:59.520]   two. At this point, the high school student learns to write and speak with force and originality.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.340]   The student of rhetoric applies the rules of logic learned in middle school to the foundational
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.200]   information learned in the early grades, and expresses her conclusions in clear, forceful,
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.400]   elegant language. The student also begins to specialize in whatever branch of knowledge
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.560]   attracts her. These are the years for art camps, college courses, foreign travel, apprenticeships,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.840]   and other forms of specialized training.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.880]   A classical education is more than just a pattern of learning, though. First, it is
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.680]   language-focused. Learning is accomplished through words, written and spoken, rather
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.640]   than through images (pictures, videos, and television). Why is this important? Language
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.880]   learning and image learning require very different habits of thought. Language requires the mind
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.760]   to work harder. In reading, the brain is forced to translate a symbol (words on the page)
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:57.680]   into a concept. Images, such as those on videos and television, allow the mind to be passive.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.720]   In front of a video screen, the brain can "sit back" and relax. Faced with a written
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.320]   page, the mind is required to roll its sleeves up and get to work.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:12.040]   Second, a classical education follows a specific three-part pattern. The mind must be first
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.880]   supplied with facts and images, then given the logical tools for organization of those
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.480]   facts and images, and finally equipped to express conclusions.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:28.400]   Third, to the classical mind, all knowledge is interrelated. Astronomy, for example, isn't
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.080]   studied in isolation. It's learned along with the history of scientific discovery,
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.960]   which leads into the Church's relationship to science and from there to the intricacies
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.720]   of medieval Church history. The reading of the Odyssey allows the student to consider
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.000]   Greek history, the nature of heroism, the development of the epic, and humankind's
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.180]   understanding of the divine.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.940]   This is easier said than done. The world is full of knowledge, and finding the links between
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:02.280]   fields of study can be a mind-twisting task. A classical education meets this challenge
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.520]   by taking history as its organizing outline, beginning with the ancients and progressing
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.900]   forward to the moderns in history, science, literature, art, and music.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:19.200]   We suggest that the twelve years of education consist of three repetitions of the same four-year
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:26.360]   pattern. The ancients (5000 BC – 400 AD), the medieval period through the early Renaissance
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:34.660]   (400-1600 AD), the late Renaissance through early modern times (1600-1850), and modern
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:41.080]   times (1850-present). The child studies these four time periods at varying levels, simple
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:47.600]   for grades 1-4, more difficult in grades 5-8 when the student begins to read original sources,
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.040]   and taking an even more complex approach in grades 9-12 when the student works through
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.960]   these time periods using original sources (from Homer to Hitler) and also has the opportunity
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.240]   to pursue a particular interest (music, dance, technology, medicine, biology, creative writing)
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.680]   in depth.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.300]   The other subject areas of the curriculum are linked to history studies. The student
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.800]   who is working on ancient history will read Greek and Roman mythology, the tales of the
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:19.080]   Iliad and Odyssey, early medieval writings, Chinese and Japanese fairy tales, and, for
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.640]   the older student, the classical texts of Plato, Herodotus, Virgil, Aristotle. She'll
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.120]   read Beowulf, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare the following year when she's studying medieval
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.680]   and early Renaissance history. When the 18th and 19th centuries are studied, she starts
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.640]   with Swift (Gulliver's Travels) and ends with Dickens. Finally, she reads modern literature
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.200]   as she is studying modern history.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.100]   The sciences are studied in a four-year pattern that roughly corresponds to the periods of
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.200]   scientific discovery (biology, classification, and the human body) subjects known to the
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.720]   ancients, earth science and basic astronomy (which flowered during the early Renaissance),
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.560]   chemistry (which came into its own during the early modern period), and basic physics
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:12.420]   and computer science (very modern subjects). This pattern lends coherence to the study
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:19.120]   of history, science, and literature, subjects that are too often fragmented and confusing.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.840]   The pattern widens and deepens as the student matures and learns. For example, a first grader
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:29.340]   listens to you read the story of the Iliad from one of the picture book versions available
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:34.560]   at any public library. Susan's experience has been that first graders think the Iliad
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:39.120]   is a blast, especially when Achilles starts hauling Hector's body around the walls of
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.760]   Troy. Four years later, the fifth grader reads one of the popular middle grade adaptations
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:51.180]   – Olivia Coolidge's The Trojan War or Roger L. Greene's The Tale of Troy. Four
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.200]   more years go by and the ninth grader, faced with Homer's Iliad itself, plunges right
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.880]   in undaunted. She already knows the story, what's to be scared of?
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.400]   In the chapters that follow, we'll show you how to follow this pattern for each subject,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.680]   list the resources you'll need, and tell you where to find these resources.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:17.080]   Classical education is, above all, systematic, in direct contrast to the scattered, unorganized
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:23.920]   nature of so much secondary education. Rigorous, systematic study has two purposes. Rigorous
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.980]   study develops virtue in the student – the ability to act in accordance to what one knows
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:34.400]   to be right. Virtuous men or women can force themselves to do what they know is right,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.720]   even when it runs against their inclinations. Classical education continually asks a student
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.040]   to work against her baser tendencies – laziness, or the desire to watch another half hour of
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.780]   TV – in order to reach a goal – mastery of a subject. Systematic study allows the
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:56.100]   student to join what Mortimer J. Adler calls "the great conversation" – the ongoing
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:02.360]   conversation of great minds down through the ages. Much modern education is so eclectic
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.080]   that the student has little opportunity to make connections between past events and the
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.560]   flood of current information. "The beauty of the classical curriculum," writes classical
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:19.360]   schoolmaster David Hicks, "is that it dwells on one problem, one author, or one epoch long
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.400]   enough to allow even the youngest student a chance to exercise his mind in a scholarly
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:31.400]   way, to make connections and to trace developments, lines of reasoning, patterns of action, recurring
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.600]   symbolisms, plots and motifs." My mother struggled hard to give us the benefits of
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.640]   a classical education. She began to teach us at home in a day when few materials existed
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:47.000]   for home-educating parents. She had to create her own curriculum. We are going to lay out
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.200]   a whole plan of study for you – not just theory, but resources and textbooks and curricula.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.220]   It's still hard work, we don't deny it. We'll give you a clear view of the demands
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.640]   and requirements of this academic project. But a classical education is worth every drop
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:07.400]   of sweat, I can testify to that. I am constantly grateful to my mother for my education. It
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:13.500]   gave me an immeasurable head start, the independence to innovate and work on my own, confidence
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.600]   in my ability to compete in the job market and the mental tools to build a satisfying
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:24.160]   career. In 15 years, I believe that my own children will say the same to me.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.020]   And that concludes the prologue, A Person to Look at Classical Education, written by
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.920]   Susan Weis Bauer. This is the prologue from the excellent book, The Well-Trained Mind,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.800]   a guide to classical education at home, by Susan Weis Bauer and Jesse Weis.
