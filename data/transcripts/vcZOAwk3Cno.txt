[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   The final tally, it looks like, is going to be 312 electoral college votes for President
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.580]   Donald Trump versus Kamala Harris' 226.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.060]   Just for context, in 2016, Trump won with 304 electoral votes and Biden won in 2020
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.840]   with 306.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.460]   So it's a pretty sweeping victory.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.880]   He won all the supposed swing states this year fairly resoundingly.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.300]   There's no real super close calls.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.940]   There's some close calls, but a pretty resounding victory.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.940]   Chamath, what happened?
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.940]   Wow.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.980]   It's a really good question.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.900]   I think that there's many layers of the answer, but I think in its most basic calculation,
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.980]   I think that the bottom fell out of the Democratic Party.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:57.700]   And if you look at why, there's a simple explanation and then there's the more nuanced explanation.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.420]   I think the simple explanation is like they just lost the script.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:11.900]   I think that there was so many people that just got really tired of being spoken at and
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:20.760]   labeled misogynist, racist, fascist, transphobe, whatever it was.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.420]   And there was just these litany of these judgmental labels that would come out instead of engaging
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.420]   on the topics at hand.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.980]   So I think the Democratic Party played this game of trying to use identities, genders,
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:43.260]   races as a bid to basically get people that they thought should always vote in their direction
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.580]   to continue to support them.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.140]   And instead what happened was people just started to think for themselves and say, "Hold
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.140]   on a second.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.260]   I'm just a normal person that wants to be left alone.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.820]   What matters to me?"
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.820]   And I think what Donald Trump spoke to was a desire for folks to have economic prosperity,
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.020]   a safe neighborhood, a predictable educational curriculum where these kids could go to school,
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.900]   not be indoctrinated and come out the other side and just know some useful skills so that
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.860]   they could get a good job and do better than they did.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.300]   And all these basic truths ended up on the ballot.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.740]   And so it was a bunch of perception versus just a bunch of hard realities.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.380]   And I think Trump stayed focused and ultimately made sure that people understood that that's
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.820]   what he was focused on.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.780]   And I think the Democrats just went to this place of demagoguery and labels.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.140]   And I think it was just a resounding defeat.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.260]   And David, I just want you to just to put a pin on how resounding it is.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.560]   In California and New York, which I would say are the two most prolific bastions of
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.700]   elitist liberal thinking, Democrats won those states in some of the narrowest margins they've
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.540]   ever seen.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.220]   I think in 2020, they won California by 29 points.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.660]   It was barely half is what they won by this year.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.940]   In New York, it shrunk to a 12 point margin.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.180]   So what is this telling you?
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.040]   It's telling you that the Democrats really need to retool and get back to first principles.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:27.000]   It was a cataclysmic dismissal of wokeism, of cancel culture, of judgmentalism.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.080]   It was an ringing endorsement of a meritocracy, of just plain, simple common sense, of talking
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.580]   with people and to people, being able to tolerate disagreements, remaining friends.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.060]   All of those things were on the ballot.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.860]   And it was just an absolute resounding victory for just normalcy.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.900]   That's what I think we saw.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.380]   We saw a return to normalcy.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.740]   Is this the nature of democracy, that over time, when you have a two-party system and
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.300]   one party veers too far to the left or one party veers too far to the right, people jump
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.260]   ship to the other party?
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.060]   And ultimately, they pull the policies of the party that they left back to the middle.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.480]   And that's the way democracy is supposed to work and has worked historically.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.220]   So is this the way it's supposed to go?
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.900]   And do we project that four years from now, the Democrats will need to be and need to
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.100]   adjust to the center, and we'll see less of this extremism because of the way the voting
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.380]   turned out this election cycle?
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.580]   Well, I think that's a very interesting question, is whether the Democrats have the necessary
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.940]   introspection to learn from this loss.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.260]   I would say that one of them does.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.940]   If you look at Matt Iglesias, who's someone I've sparred with on TwitterX, who is a Democrat
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.700]   partisan, he basically tweeted a list of principles that he thought the Democrat party needed
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   to adopt.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   I read it and retweeted it.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.020]   I said, laughing my ass off, this is a list of Republican principles.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.900]   It was all about, you know, opposing woke and being in favor of merit and innovation.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.900]   Tolerance.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.900]   Tolerance.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.900]   I'm like, great.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.900]   Look, you know what?
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.860]   If the Democratic Party wants to adopt these principles, that's a wonderful thing for the
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.860]   country.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.560]   I hope that they do it.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   Okay.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   But will they do it?
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.980]   I have my doubts.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.960]   You look at this tweet by Ari Fleischer, where he talks about who the Democratic Party now
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   is.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.260]   Yeah, I think that this is a really important tweet because it sort of tells you, Sax, who's
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.820]   going to be left in the room?
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.300]   If these are the only people left in the room, the last thing they're going to do is admit
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.300]   defeat.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.300]   Right.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   Exactly.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.260]   So what you see is that the Democratic Party base is these very affluent, very overeducated,
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.120]   very non-religious types.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.640]   And frankly, I wonder whether they're too out of touch to know they're out of touch.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.540]   They're certainly very whiny and entitled.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.060]   And I just don't think they're going to cede control of the party without a fight.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.940]   And frankly, they've disappeared so far up their own woke asses that I don't think they
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.660]   can find an electoral majority if they try.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.740]   So if these people stay in control of the party, and these are the people who you're
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.740]   seeing having a mental breakdown on TikTok, they're posting all the videos, they're insulting
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.780]   the electorate.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.860]   And let's face it, it's not just on TikTok, it's on the legacy media, it's on MSDNC.
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.020]   It's basically the legacy media who are trying to diagnose a psychosis in the American electorate
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.780]   to explain why they were so wrong.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.400]   If those people stay in control, I think that the Republicans could have an electoral majority
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.460]   as far as the eye can see.
