[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.560]   If God's will prevails, is it pointless for me to pray for what I want?
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.280]   This is a really good question from a podcast listener named Andrea.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   Why should we pray for things that we want, happiness for ourselves or healing for others,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.760]   if we know in the end that God's will will be done?
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.160]   I struggle with praying for what I want because I know in the end God's plan will prevail
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.160]   anyways.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.640]   And besides, He knows better than me because He is sovereign.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.320]   I feel like this thought sometimes inhibits my prayer life.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.420]   Isn't it pointless for me to pray for what I want?
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.680]   But then if I don't pray for what I want, what then would be the point of praying anyways?"
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.120]   Oh my, this is good.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.460]   There are so many questions to ask about prayer.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.160]   We can ask, "What does it mean to pray according to God's will?"
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160]   1 John 5:14.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.680]   "What does it mean to pray in the name of Jesus?"
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.440]   John 14, 13.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.160]   "What does it mean not to pray for the sin that leads to death?"
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.560]   1 John 5, 16.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.080]   Why is God compared to an unrighteous judge in Luke 18 when we pray?
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.600]   Or what does it mean to pray without ceasing in 1 Thessalonians 5, 17?
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.680]   Or what does it mean to pray in the Holy Spirit if He's in 6, 18 and on and on and on we
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   could go?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.320]   It's not surprising, it seems to me, therefore, that since prayer is one of the most stunning,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.640]   amazing, astounding privileges given to human beings, that it would be shrouded in mystery.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.720]   I mean, think of it.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.840]   The Creator of the universe with infinite wisdom and infinite power and infinite goodness
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.240]   is telling us, finite, fallible, sinful creatures, to ask Him to do things that we think would
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.840]   be good for the glory of His name and for the good of the world.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.000]   And that is exactly what the Lord's Prayer tells us to do.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.640]   Pray, "Hallowed be Your name."
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.040]   That means glorify Your name, God honor Your name, revere Your name, and make sure Your
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.000]   will is done the way the angels do it in heaven, and so on.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.160]   So I just begin this by saying, prayer is amazing to me.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.720]   I love it, I'm baffled by it, I'm stunned.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.200]   But she asked, I think, an answerable question.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.520]   A lot of people stumble over it.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.560]   I think it's one of the questions that has an answer in the Bible.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.400]   She asked one straightforward question.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.880]   "Pastor John, why should we pray for things we want—happiness for ourselves or healing
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.760]   for others—if we know in the end God's will will be done?"
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.320]   That's her question.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.840]   Well, there are three reasons why you should pray for things that you want, even though
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.520]   we know God's sovereign will will be done.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.800]   Number one, because God commands us to.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.600]   He tells us to pray for what we want, provided our wants are shaped by His Word.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:30.040]   John 15:7, "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish"—ha-e-on-thel-e-teh,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.840]   if you want the Greek—"what you want, and it will be done for you."
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.680]   So He tells us, "Ask for whatever you wish."
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.160]   We're not supposed to try to divine the sovereign will of God and then simply say, "Do that!"
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.060]   That's not what prayer is.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:00.280]   We do not know ahead of time the sovereign will of God that governs all things.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:09.440]   We are supposed to let the Word abide in us and shape our wants and our wishes by the
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.720]   revealed will of God, not the sovereign, all-controlling will of God.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.080]   The revealed will of God, for example, is 1 Peter 3:11, "Seek peace, Piper, seek peace,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.800]   and pursue it."
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.600]   Now the way the sovereign will of God may work itself out in my life or your life in
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.800]   any certain situation, I don't know.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   It may be crucifixion.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.400]   That's not peace.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.920]   I'm not after that, and that's what happened to Jesus.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.880]   We pray toward what He tells us to pursue, not by trying to figure out what He sovereignly
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   decrees.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.120]   So that's number one.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.440]   Ask for what you want, because the Bible says to ask for what you want, not to pray for
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.040]   the things that you dream up God's going to do tomorrow.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:13.240]   Number two, we should ask for what we want informed by the Word, because if we don't,
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.800]   we may not get it.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.000]   James 4:2, "You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.360]   Now let that sink in.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.860]   There is a real causal connection between our asking and God's giving.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.840]   The absence of asking is the cause of the absence of receiving.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.220]   That's what James says.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.020]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.660]   So ask, lest in failing to ask, you fail to receive.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.660]   There it is.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.660]   Period.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.660]   Believe that.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.660]   Do that.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.760]   Number three, and this is the reason that number two is valid, that we may fail to receive
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.080]   when we fail to ask.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.280]   Here's the reason.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:11.440]   God plans our prayers just as surely as he plans the events that he performs in answer
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.840]   to our prayers.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.160]   Take Jesus' prayer for Peter and for Peter's repentance after his denial.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:27.960]   For example, Luke 22:32, he prays like this before Peter denied him, which he told him
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   he would do.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.360]   "I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.960]   And when," not if, "when you have turned, strengthen your brothers."
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.320]   So God had planned for Peter to deny Jesus.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.120]   That's why Jesus knew he would.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.400]   That's why Jesus said he would.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.000]   And God had planned for Jesus to pray for Peter's repentance.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.280]   And God had planned in answer to that prayer to cause Peter to repent, which he did.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   So it would make no sense to say God's will for Peter is going to happen no matter what
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.720]   Jesus prays, when in fact Jesus' prayer was part of what God willed.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.680]   And that's the way it is with all prayer.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:29.440]   God doesn't plan the world and then wonder if anybody's going to pray for part of his
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.800]   plan to be changed.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:39.520]   He plans the world, and part of his planning for the world is the praying of his people
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.680]   for what he plans to do.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.800]   Here's an example from Ezekiel 36.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.880]   "The nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the Lord.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.440]   I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.840]   I am Yahweh, the Lord.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.400]   I have spoken.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.040]   I will do it.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:16.760]   Thus says the Lord God, this also I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.560]   namely to increase their people like a flock."
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:26.440]   Now, the word "let" doesn't quite get the sense of the Hebrew as though God were
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.240]   just giving permission for them to pray.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.000]   Like, "I will let the house of Israel ask me to do this."
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.280]   No, more literally, it's a statement of intention and purpose from God.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:48.200]   It says, "This also I will be sought," that is, prayed to, "I will be sought by
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:55.040]   the house of Israel to do for them, namely to increase them like a flock of men."
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:03.000]   In other words, God intends to restore and increase Israel, and so he purposes, he plans,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.080]   he intends their prayer.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.280]   "For this I will be sought by the house of Israel to do this for them, because I
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.240]   intend to do this for them, as I have just said."
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:23.840]   So the third reason we should ask for what we want, what we wish, is that God plans our
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.780]   prayers just as surely as he plans the events that come from them.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.980]   So don't question God's way of doing things.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:40.280]   He loves us, and he's not toying with us when he says, "Be constant in prayer, and
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:47.040]   let your requests be made known to God, and pray at all times, and continue steadfastly
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.800]   in prayer, and pray without ceasing, and ask and you shall receive, and do not lose heart
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   in praying."
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.840]   He's not toying with us when he says all these things.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:08.520]   He's granting us the dignity of joining with him in glorifying himself as part of
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.040]   the cause of all that he does.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:18.680]   Beautiful synthesis of God's absolute sovereignty and his desire that we pray from our own desires.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.600]   Whether you listen in the car, at the gym, doing chores, thank you for inviting us into

[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.440]   Well each of our lives are shaped by multiple forces.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.360]   The friends that we choose, the parents we didn't choose, and the socioeconomic class
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.120]   background that we had little or no control over.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.440]   So can we say that we are mainly the product of our background?
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.000]   That is the question up next time.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
