[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180]   Does ketogenic diet improve mitochondrial function?
[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.740]   And if so, how does that work?
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.800]   The quick summary story for people who don't know ketogenic...
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.600]   So ketogenic diet is a 100-year-old evidence-based treatment for epilepsy.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.680]   It can stop seizures even when medications fail to.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.200]   We have over a dozen controlled trials of ketogenic diets
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.400]   in children, in particular, with treatment-resistant epilepsy.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.340]   We have two Cochrane reviews that came out positive.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.720]   So Cochrane reviews are the gold standard in the medical field for meta-analyses.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.680]   Very rigorous.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.400]   And they analyzed the data that exists and came to the conclusion that ketogenic diet...
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.340]   If somebody has treatment-resistant epilepsy, compared to treatment as usual,
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.800]   which is try another anti-epileptic medication,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.540]   the ketogenic diet is six times more likely to result in seizure freedom.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.400]   ...than just trying yet another epilepsy pill.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.340]   So the ketogenic diet is a powerful anti-convulsant treatment.
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.780]   We use anti-convulsant treatments in psychiatry every day in tens of millions of people.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.280]   Lots of these medications are used.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:25.880]   So at this point, we now have over 50 published pilot trials, case series, case reports,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.240]   other lines of evidence of the ketogenic diet for psychiatric disorders.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.680]   Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, anorexia, nervosa, surprisingly.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.320]   These 50 reports represent over 1,900 people.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.140]   And on balance, the ketogenic diet appears to be an effective treatment,
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.540]   sometimes an extraordinarily effective treatment,
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.840]   like in able to induce remission of schizophrenia or bipolar
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.040]   in people who otherwise had treatment-resistant disorders.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.180]   And they're going off medication simultaneously?
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.680]   Some of them are.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.000]   So there are, you know, I have heard probably from thousands of people around the world
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.900]   since my work has become more public.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:32.340]   And actually, our first podcast together, hands down, the most cited reason people know who I am.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.620]   As they should.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.440]   Well, I know about you, but it's Huberman, that Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.920]   Well, I'm just a runway for people to, incredible messages to take off.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.880]   Thank you again for the opportunity to disseminate this word.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.300]   And because at the end of the day, I'm hearing from thousands of people who simply listened
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.760]   to that podcast, made changes, started a ketogenic diet for their schizophrenia
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.080]   or other treatment-resistant mental disorder, reach out to me.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.420]   You saved my life.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.540]   I can't tell you how many times I've gotten handwritten notes, emails, messages from people
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.200]   who use those words.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.620]   You saved my life.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.860]   I never met this person.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.760]   All I did was share this knowledge.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.880]   And then they saved their own lives with knowledge.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.240]   Coming back to your question now, in a roundabout way, does the ketogenic diet impact mitochondrial
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.720]   health?
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.240]   We have strong evidence that it does.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.900]   And so it appears, so the ketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.400]   And I just want to say that again.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.140]   The ketogenic diet mimics the fasting state.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.000]   What does that mean?
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.780]   It means the ketogenic diet is mimicking no food consumption.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.000]   So is the ketogenic diet the healthiest diet that everybody should follow?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.040]   No, that's not the way I think about it.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.180]   The ketogenic diet is an intervention.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.500]   It is shifting metabolism.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:25.660]   It is shifting countless kind of systems, signaling pathways, other things, gene expression in the
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.200]   human body and brain.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.820]   And that results in effects.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.740]   And the good news is these effects appear to be life-changing and life-saving sometimes.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.440]   So they're highly beneficial effects.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:50.580]   Again, dose and the way you do it matter because fasting, the extreme version of fasting is starvation
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.520]   and that results in death.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.200]   So that is not at all a good thing.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.440]   Not feasible.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.440]   So let's make sure that if you're going to do a ketogenic diet or a fasting regimen that
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.120]   you're not depriving yourself of essential nutrition, that you're getting enough calories, you're
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.760]   getting enough nutrients, that you're doing it in a medically sound way so that you're optimizing
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.340]   your health and not hurting your health.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:28.400]   We have, you know, it's hard to measure this in humans in vitro because we can't like do
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.140]   an intervention to a human and then dissect their brain and like biopsy it and look at
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.480]   the mitochondria under the microscope.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:43.040]   So we mostly have animal data that supports this, but animal data strongly supports that ketogenic
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.520]   interventions improve mitophagy, so getting rid of these old and defective mitochondria.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.340]   So you're kind of cleaning house, you're getting rid of the bad, and then you're replacing them
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.000]   with new fresh ones, mitochondrial biogenesis, so that at the end of the day, the cell
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.060]   will have more healthy mitochondria.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.920]   Now, some researchers have really hyper-focused on the ketogenic diet might be working through
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.600]   the gut microbiome, this gut-brain connection, and we have some evidence that that is true.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   So researchers actually took feces from human children with epilepsy before starting a ketogenic
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.760]   ketogenic diet, and then afterward while they were stable on a ketogenic diet, and then they
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:44.700]   transferred these fecal samples to mice who were predisposed to epilepsy or predisposed to
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.000]   seizures.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.800]   When they took the feces from the children while the children still had or seizing, the mice
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:02.160]   were more likely to seize when they took the feces from the children doing the ketogenic diet and
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.380]   transferred it to the mice, the mice were less likely to have seizures.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.980]   Interesting.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.920]   Even though the mice were not on ketogenic diets.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:21.540]   So there's something in the feces of children with epilepsy doing ketogenic diets that has an
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.620]   anti-seizure effect.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.120]   What could that something be?
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:32.360]   It could be the gut microbiome, but it could be molecules, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:40.500]   other things that those microbes are producing, or it could be neuropeptides and other factors
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.760]   that the gut cells are producing.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.060]   So we really don't know for sure what exactly is it.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.900]   So on the surface, there's something in the feces.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.000]   There's a gut microbiome, a gut-brain connection thing.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.120]   What does that have to do with mitochondria?
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:06.240]   So another research group did that same model, got mice to have an anti-seizure effect from
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.540]   a ketogenic diet, and then dissected their brains looking for what changed in the brain.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:21.240]   How exactly is a ketogenic diet having an anti-seizure effect in the brain?
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:28.260]   Because that's the pathology, the pathological finding seizure is occurring in the brain.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:39.400]   And when they analyzed genetic changes, up-regulation, down-regulation, it all centered on mitochondria.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:48.620]   That the changes in the gut were resulting in mitochondrial changes in the brain, which means
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.620]   brain energy metabolism in the brain.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:59.180]   And so again, it's an umbrella theory doesn't replace what we know.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.580]   It's not gut microbiome or serotonin.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.540]   It's not gut microbiome or mitochondria.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.560]   It's both.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.260]   Both of them are true, and it's all interconnected.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:21.580]   So I do think we've got more than enough data that ketogenic therapies impact brain metabolism,
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.520]   which then impacts neurotransmitters.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:36.140]   That's really what I hope will become one of many really important studies published by Ian
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:43.240]   Campbell and colleagues in the UK, that they just did a pilot trial, 20 patients with bipolar
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:51.100]   disorder, put on ketogenic diets, and they found wide-ranging improvements in metabolic health
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.660]   biomarkers, like weight, blood pressure, other things.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:02.720]   But they also found a reduction in brain glutamate activity, which is often associated with bipolar
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.280]   disorder and hyperexcitability and seizures.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:13.240]   And so that helps us understand, again, it's not metabolic or glutamate, a neurotransmitter.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:13.960]   It's both.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.100]   It's putting it together.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.120]   Yeah, the Campbell study is really interesting.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.500]   We will link to that in the show note captions.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:28.360]   And incidentally, we will also link to this American Heart Association appalling quote-unquote
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.080]   testimony.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.100]   Sorry, AHA.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.940]   I'm not sorry.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.260]   I'm not sorry.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.300]   But then again, I'm not a physician, so I don't have to worry about that.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.060]   Well, maybe I do.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.000]   Anyway.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.300]   I'm not a cardiologist.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:50.220]   Is there any rationale for people who don't have epilepsy or don't suffer from bipolar or
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:57.860]   schizophrenia, but like myself, would like to keep our mitochondrial function as strong as
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.380]   possible for doing a brief ketogenic intervention?
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.300]   Yes.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.060]   The answer is yes.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:12.880]   Can intermittent – so I'm going to lump ketogenic with other fasting-mimicking diets and fasting
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.400]   itself.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:23.160]   So can intermittent fasting or can cycles of fasting have health-improving qualities or health-improving
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.900]   effects?
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.220]   Absolutely.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:33.960]   So interestingly, before I talk about even some of the science on this, and it's not
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.060]   super robust.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.680]   Why?
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.380]   Because again, we don't fund diet studies.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.460]   There's no money to be made from dietary interventions.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.260]   Really?
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.620]   There's no patent on it.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.620]   Nobody cares about dietary interventions.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.240]   But there are a lot of studies on exercise interventions.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:57.880]   But even those are – they're not huge randomized controlled trials with 10,000 participants.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:05.760]   They're not – you know, like even the federal government will fund large-scale medication
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.740]   trials, statin studies, and others.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.760]   But they often don't.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.540]   I mean, there have been a few – the Women's Health Initiative funded a massive dietary intervention
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.400]   study, and unfortunately, that was a huge disappointment to the field because it was negative.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:29.860]   They randomized women to just keep doing the diet you're eating or go on a low-fat diet,
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:39.780]   and the low-fat diet didn't do anything for their heart health or other objective kind of outcome
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.420]   measures.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:48.320]   And put another way, just to really close this for people, it means a low-fat diet is
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.020]   no better than the standard American diet.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.620]   A low-fat diet is equivalent.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:00.720]   You get equivalent health effects from a low-fat diet to a standard American diet.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.940]   That's really bad.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:10.040]   So low-fat diets need to go away, and people who promote low-fat diets need to stop promoting.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.080]   They need to come up to speed with the science and just, like, move on.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.680]   Like, at least acknowledge there are healthy fats.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.440]   Even though fat has more calories, don't worry about those calories.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.940]   Worry about the health effects, the long-term health effects.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.420]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.880]   You got to get those monounsaturated fats, and you got to get your omega-3s, and you have
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.080]   to – you know, and I'm a believer in eating some butter here and there.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.760]   You were asking me about intermittent ketogenic diets or intermittent fasting.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.700]   Intermittent fasting.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:46.300]   So I'll just say that we have a long history in multiple cultures on Earth for thousands
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.140]   of years.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.820]   Fasting has been part of healing rituals.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:02.240]   India, India, China, Christian – fasting has been a part of rituals.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.660]   And, you know, most people just assume it's religious folklore or just silliness or whatever.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:14.260]   But I actually think millennia of humans were not all stupid idiots.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:20.080]   And that some people along the way actually noticed this seems to do something useful.
