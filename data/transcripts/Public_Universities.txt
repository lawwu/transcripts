[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode we want to talk about
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.760]   why more public schools will eventually rank higher than private schools.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.440]   So if you have kids or if you went to college, I think this is a really interesting conversation
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   that we're about to have.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.000]   And I have here with me Sydney, my wife.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Say hello.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Hi everybody.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.200]   So you may not know, but Sydney and I, we met at the College of William & Mary when
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.760]   I was a senior and she was a freshman.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.920]   We met in Japanese 101 class and we hit it off.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.160]   So William & Mary is a public school and when I went, the freshman and sophomore year was
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.720]   about $2,800 a year in tuition, which I thought was a great deal.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   And the main reason why I didn't want to go to a private school, I got into Babson College,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.840]   which is a small private college, but at the time it was like $25,000 a year.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.420]   So I thought back then going to William & Mary was good value.
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.760]   What did you think about going to William & Mary?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.280]   I also wanted to go to a state school, not that far from home, not that big, that offered
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.000]   liberal arts and it just was a great fit.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.880]   Oh, speaking of liberal arts, it is a liberal arts school and so many people kind of bash
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.880]   liberal arts.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.460]   You know, they think you should go into STEM, you know, the sciences and so forth.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.680]   But I'm not sure that's correct because I know a lot of really awkward people who are
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.200]   very one-dimensional after graduating from college and when you apply to jobs like at
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.840]   Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, any of these firms that pay pretty well, I think they're looking
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.980]   for more well-rounded people who can learn, adapt, work in teams, socialize, and communicate.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.680]   So as a hiring manager for over 10 years or about 10 years, what are your thoughts about
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.560]   the argument that it's better to go to a liberal arts school rather than a school and focus
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.840]   on a technical degree?
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.120]   I definitely agree with what you're saying about finding well-rounded people.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:04.480]   I wouldn't necessarily exclude a candidate based on going to a technical school, but
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:14.200]   having someone who is open-minded and able to communicate well with a lot of people and
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.120]   has a bunch of skills that can be applied to many different types of roles is really
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   important.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.840]   So yeah, and I guess technical is not the right word, you know, science, STEM stuff.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.880]   It just seems like when you graduate college and you join any kind of job, you learn on
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.040]   the job.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.640]   So I think the most important ability is to be able to learn, try hard, and figure things
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.160]   out and adapt rather than think, "Hey, you know these things from textbooks and these
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.880]   things from projects, and you're going to hit the ground running."
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.400]   I don't think it really is the case in most cases.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.800]   I would agree with that.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.960]   There's a lot of things that you're not going to be able to learn in college that's going
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.360]   to be applicable to a specific role that you're getting hired for.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.640]   That was definitely the case for the company that I was working for.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.560]   All of our software was proprietary, so nobody could learn that software outside of our company.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.600]   Everything had to be learned on the job.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.720]   But what we were really looking for were people who were detail-oriented, people who could
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.680]   follow instructions, people who could communicate well.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.880]   Those are skills that you could pick up at any school or just in high school as well.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.120]   But I definitely agree with your point on finding well-rounded people.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.600]   So back to the topic about rankings, college rankings.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.960]   I think college rankings, a lot of students and parents are obsessed with them.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.400]   They're fun to look at, but they're frankly kind of boring in my mind.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.580]   US News and World Report always has their college rankings every year, and it's always
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.440]   the same five, ten schools every single year.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.880]   It's like Harvard, Princeton, Yale, yada, yada, yada.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.360]   I've written all about that.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.280]   To me, it just seems irrelevant.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.680]   Why do you keep on pumping out these rankings with the same type of schools over and over
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.420]   again?
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.480]   One of the things that came out of the college admissions bribery scandal, also called Operation
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:31.840]   Varsity Blues in 2019, is that I was under the assumption and I was predicting that private
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.480]   schools, elite private schools, would lose some of its luster, some of its prestige and
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.960]   reputation because we found out that already wealthy families were bribing their kids'
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.360]   way into these schools in the tune of it was like 10 grand, 50 grand to $6 million.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.400]   Schools such as Georgetown, Stanford, UCLA, which is a public school, University of San
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.480]   Diego, USC, Wake Forest, and Yale, those were the schools all involved in the scandal.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.360]   I thought, "Well, I think the world is going to wake up to the fact that, huh, the system
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   is rigged."
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.640]   You learned about the admissions criteria at Harvard where they have these really subjective
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.720]   scales and they rate people by their personality and stuff like that, and it's very different
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   among races.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.000]   It just seemed like this whole scandal would wake the world up, parents and students, to
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.680]   how rigged the college ranking system is and how it's kind of all BS in a way because you
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.600]   can just bribe your way in through the back door or through the front door.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   What are your thoughts on college rankings in general and spending big bucks on private
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.120]   universities versus going to a more affordable state school?
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.960]   I think that the rankings can be helpful when applying to college, but I don't think they
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.520]   should be taken so seriously as some people do.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.040]   I think nobody really cares after a few years of working where you went to school.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040]   Right.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.520]   The only people who care are students currently in college, the parents of students who are
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.880]   currently in college, and maybe one year out.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.920]   The funny joke here in San Francisco Bay Area is how do you know if someone went to Stanford?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.600]   They'll tell you in the first one or two seconds.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   It's hilarious.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.760]   I'm assuming that's the same joke in Boston with Harvard and Connecticut with Yale and
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.100]   so forth because when you're a student, you're a cost center.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.100]   You don't know jack.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.000]   You just know stuff from the books and you kind of theorize how things are going to be.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.200]   As a cost center in your early 20s, you need to be diligent.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.880]   You need to get in on time.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.640]   If you have to go to work on time, you got to ask how you can help and create more value
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.840]   because you're a cost center.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   You're learning.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.540]   Eventually, you're going to start earning money for the company and so forth.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.440]   But in that crucial time period, hustling very hard at work, I think is very important.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.840]   In terms of the college rankings, I was very pleased to see that Forbes changed its college
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   ranking methodology.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:18.160]   You know, it took a break in 2020 due to the pandemic, but in 2021, it decided to increase
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.640]   the weighting of the percentage of poor students who applied and got into school as a ranking
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   variable.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.700]   So, quote, it said, "It isn't enough to ask which schools give the best return on investment.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.640]   It's also important to evaluate what kind of students they educate and whether they
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.600]   make themselves accessible to those who can't afford high sticker prices.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.120]   Even if like Harvard, they promise to pay full freight for the low-income applicants
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.720]   they accept, do they take enough disadvantaged students to make that promise meaningful?
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.320]   UC Berkeley does a much better job at this than Harvard.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.840]   At Berkeley, 27% of undergraduates receive federal Pell grants aimed at helping low and
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.240]   moderate income students pay for college.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.560]   At Harvard, by contrast, the share of Pell students is just 12%.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.360]   Meanwhile, the Harvard endowment is tens of billions of dollars.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.200]   And on average, 25% of students enrolled in our 600 top colleges received Pell grants.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.660]   So Harvard is way below the average, like 60% below the average.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:28.880]   So in other words, Forbes decided to look at the hard data and not just accept lip service
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   from private schools.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.600]   It's really easy for the marketers at private elite schools with massive, massive endowments
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.320]   to say that they're doing their best to provide equal opportunities for all people.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   Think about it.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.780]   A lot of schools, their goal is to try to educate people and to help people.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.320]   But if they really wanted to educate as many people as possible and help as many people
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.800]   as possible, they should accept more people.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   Why not accept more people and get that education, give them that education?
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.520]   The demand is certainly there.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.840]   And further, they would also accept a higher percentage of students from low income households.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.040]   Why wouldn't they do that?
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.920]   Well, I think we all know the reason why.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.720]   And the reason why is once you're rich, and once you're hanging around with other rich
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.520]   people, you kind of just go with that inertia and you want to hang out with other rich people
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.980]   and other connected people and other families who are going to donate money and do this
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.980]   and that.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.980]   And I think it's kind of sad.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.760]   Yeah, this actually reminds me of our preschool application process where we were looking
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.140]   at a bunch of different preschools across San Francisco.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:44.520]   And a lot of them will say in their marketing, "Our school values diversity and inclusion."
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:51.780]   And then when you go and you go to an open house, for example, or you just learn more
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.440]   about what's really going on at that school from people you know who have attended there
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.120]   and whatnot, you find out that very few of these schools are actually doing what they
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120]   claim they are.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120]   Right.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.560]   I mean, it's all lip service.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.800]   We went to, I think, five preschool open houses, and they talked about diversity and inclusion.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.480]   And I think most of the kids, like 90% of the kids were white.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.120]   And it was a very homogenous environment.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.400]   Whereas the city of San Francisco is a minority-majority city.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.040]   Minorities are the majority, in other words.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:35.320]   And so to be so different in terms of reflecting the demographics of the city felt so jolting
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.780]   to us that we decided we didn't want to send our kids to such a school.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.160]   No matter how much they say in their marketing material or the website that they're looking
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.400]   for different types of people.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.680]   I think it's clear, it's clear it's not true.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.360]   We have gone to these open houses.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:11:01.360]   And I think if you talk to people from certain elite private universities, it's so amazing
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.720]   what a high percentage of these families already come from wealth.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   Yes.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.840]   So if you're curious about the Forbes College Rankings for 2021 and 2022, they are from
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:21.520]   top to bottom, Berkeley, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, MIT, Harvard, UCLA, UPenn,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.080]   Number 10, Northwestern, Dartmouth, Duke, Cornell, Vanderbilt, Number 15, UC San Diego,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.720]   Amherst, USC, Williams, Pomona, UC Davis at number 20, Georgetown, Michigan, University
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.600]   of Chicago, Rice, and University of Florida at number 25.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.080]   And I think obviously there's going to be some uproar, some pushback from the traditional
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.340]   institutions that have always been in the top 10, especially if you're an alumni.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.000]   And that's totally understandable.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.360]   I would fight and say, "Ah, that's BS.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.520]   How can these schools be above my school?"
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.920]   But it's all kind of subjective.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.480]   But if you understand the methodology, I think it is something that we need to be aware of
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:10.160]   and how other ranking systems, whether it's from The Economist or any other magazine,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.960]   they are probably going to be changing their variable weightings going forward to reflect
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.400]   changing society, changing demands of society.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.560]   And if they don't change, so if US News and World Report doesn't change, I think they're
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.040]   going to be looked at as out of touch.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   What are your thoughts?
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.600]   I totally agree.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   Times are changing and the rankings should change with it.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.800]   I mean, I think everything is changing, so you got to change with the times.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.160]   You know, I think back to my high school days, my family didn't have the money to pay for
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.360]   $2,000 Princeton review classes and $50 an hour after school tutors.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.160]   Instead, my parents told me to go to the library and borrow an SAT book.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.760]   And the SAT book was already all marked up and scratched.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.560]   And I would say 90% of the time, the answers are already filled in.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.600]   And I'm like, "Okay, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.040]   So that's the answer."
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.520]   I'm not properly learning.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.280]   And so when I got a mediocre SAT score, they just told me to try again.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.540]   And when I could score no higher, that was it.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:16.000]   They weren't like in a panic, "Oh, you didn't get a 1200.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.720]   We're going to have to put money behind you raising your score."
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.600]   They just said, "Yeah, that's the way it's going to be."
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.480]   I mean, what was it like with your family?
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.960]   Mine was similar, maybe slightly different.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.600]   I did get my parents to get me a book from Barnes & Noble, which I don't even think exists
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.720]   anymore.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.940]   But they couldn't help me with the studying.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:47.640]   They didn't have the experience or the education to know what it was like to apply to colleges.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.800]   And I had to figure it out on my own.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.360]   And I guess there's a definite benefit for figuring things out on your own.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.440]   Problem solving, in other words.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.120]   It's this indelible memory that drives me to keep Financial Samurai always free.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.400]   I always think back to the kid sitting with me in the library, trying to study or try
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.160]   to go online and learn something.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.680]   And if I'm going to put up a paywall, it just feels like an anathema.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.720]   I just can't do it.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.840]   And so I hope more and more people can learn about personal finances, learn about other
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.920]   things through this podcast or my writing for free.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:32.240]   So in conclusion, I guess I want to talk about the cost of private school versus public school
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   again.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.640]   I just love this topic.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.400]   Let's say you send your kid to private school from kindergarten through the 12th grade.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.280]   So that's 13 years at $30,000 a year.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.560]   That's $390,000.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:51.680]   And if you let it grow, let's say you invested it instead, it probably would double to, let's
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.280]   say, $700,000 to $800,000.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.400]   And then if you go to private university, that's another right now it's like $70,000
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   all in.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:08.000]   So we're talking let's say a million dollars from kindergarten through college, a million
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   dollars.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.320]   So if you could rewind back time and I told you as a 8-year-old or 10-year-old or 12-year-old,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:23.560]   you know, "Daddy will give you a big, big check if you decide to go to public school
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.880]   and public university or you can go to private school and get no check."
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.880]   What are your thoughts?
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:37.760]   First of all, at 8 or 12 years old, I don't think I would have any understanding of what
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.600]   that really means.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.040]   Like, "Oh, money, that sounds great."
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.880]   But I don't think a child is gonna understand that question.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.520]   We can convert it from money to toys, to free time, to whatever.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.760]   We can change that currency from money to something they really care about.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.360]   Or I mean if you tell any child, "Do you want more toys?"
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   They're gonna say yes, but they're not gonna really think about what they could possibly
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.080]   be giving up for that.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:16.680]   Yeah, I just – the personal finance side of me just thinks, "Man, just give me the
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.320]   million dollars at age 22, 23.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.040]   You don't have to give it to me right away.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.320]   You can splice and dice it.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.120]   Let's say 50,000 the first year, 60,000 next year, all that, you know, so that I don't
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.920]   blow all the money because I'm so immature."
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.800]   But it just seems like if we're going to school to get a purposeful and meaningful
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:43.120]   job to be able to make money, to then have our own freedom, why don't we just give
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   the million-dollar check to our kids and therefore it would buy immediate freedom right away
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.160]   or they could feel little pressure so they can really pursue their dreams.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.280]   I think that sounds great.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.200]   However, I think everybody's circumstances are different.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.240]   Even if you have, let's say, the same net worth as another family but you live in a
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.100]   different state or a different city, the circumstances could be totally different.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:18.000]   Public schools vary so much even from one neighboring zip code to the next.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.040]   And for me, it's just hard to break that down to something so simple because, I don't
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.640]   know, I just think there's so many variables.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:34.920]   It's so simple to me because so long as you're not getting beaten up, abused, picked on at
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:40.360]   a school, I think you are in a good enough setting where you can learn.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.600]   Now of course, right, if your child is just getting pummeled to a pulp every single week
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.320]   because the kids are bad and the parents are totally neglecting their own children which
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.640]   causes bullying, then yeah, you should change schools and protect your child at all cost.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:07.020]   But if a school is free and it's good enough, I don't see why that's so bad.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.000]   You know I'm going to argue the other way.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Why though?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Well, I just think that yes, a school is there to teach children but you have to look at
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.760]   not just necessarily if the school is public or private but also what kind of resources
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   does the school have?
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.640]   What are the class sizes?
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.480]   How long have the teachers been at that school?
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.400]   What is the administration like?
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.460]   How involved is the community and the parents?
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.720]   There's just so many different variables for each individual school whether or not they're
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.380]   public or private.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.720]   But I totally see where you're coming from, right, from a financial, you know, personal
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.080]   finance bloggers perspective.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:58.440]   Of course you want to help people gain financial independence sooner rather than later and
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:09.320]   going to a public school versus private is a very good way to come out with more money.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.420]   But then again, not necessarily.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.420]   Of course it's necessary.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.940]   But where's the money going to come from?
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:20.140]   Like if you attend private school, that money could be invested elsewhere.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.940]   However, but it's not just about the cost of the school.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.580]   It's also what happens after you graduate, right?
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.100]   How well educated are you?
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.860]   Were you pushed to your maximum potential?
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.780]   Where did you end up going to college?
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.660]   Where did you end up getting your first job?
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.420]   What kind of networks were you building?
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:45.580]   Yeah, I'm just going to say no to that because your view is that our decisions to go to public
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:51.500]   school and public university were the wrong, were the suboptimal ones.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.380]   But I think we're living a great life.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.380]   I was able to get a job.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.380]   You were able to get a job.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.100]   We were able to save money, invest.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.140]   We were able to build a passive income portfolio so we can, we both were able to leave our
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.820]   jobs by 35.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.100]   Now if I had gone to private school, I think my parents would be settled with a lot more
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.100]   debt.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.300]   I think I would have felt a lot more pressure to be somebody, to make that money, to like
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.380]   try to get a return on the investment.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.100]   But no, I didn't feel that pressure at all.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.180]   I knew that even if I was a failure, I couldn't get any job out of college.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.900]   I could just go back to my day job at McDonald's or my part-time job at McDonald's back then,
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.780]   you know, at $4 an hour and pay my parents back the $2,800 in a relatively short period
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.780]   of time.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:38.740]   I guess, I guess where I'm coming from is I'm focused more in my head on what happens
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.860]   before you get to college, you know, grade school, private versus public.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:49.820]   I know we're talking about college rankings here, but I think when you think about public
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:55.540]   versus private, you have to look at the whole picture of education that starts.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   That's so subjective.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.380]   When you talk about whole picture, it's just like, how do you quantify whole picture?
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.940]   All we can quantify is what we've experienced and we experienced public schools.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.020]   I guess you went to private school for high school.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.020]   I went to both.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.820]   And so you see a difference.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:17.260]   But I also went to private international school when I was abroad and I just saw, okay, yeah,
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.620]   the characters or my classmates and public school were a little bit rougher, just kind
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.180]   of like my softball friends are a little bit, a little bit rougher on the edges.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.220]   You know, you got to stand up for yourself.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.700]   But I think these situations, this is real world here.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.380]   The real world is a battle.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.420]   It's not, you know, we got all the money and we can shelter our children from all of life's
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420]   miseries.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:42.180]   I guess the other way, the other thing that I'm thinking about is when you're a student
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.220]   going to college, you've learned so much more.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:52.580]   You're much more mature going into college as, you know, typically 18 year old student
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.140]   versus in grade school.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.060]   You haven't experienced life as much.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:05.140]   So whether or not you go to a public or private college, I just think it's from a student
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.660]   perspective, it's very different.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.660]   Okay.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.700]   So you're saying you're saying you'd be more amenable to sending your child to a public
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.900]   university at an older age university?
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.900]   Yes.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   Yes.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.900]   Okay, good.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.900]   So I've got that down.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:24.220]   So four years out of 18 years of education, we can do the public school route.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.980]   So now I got to work on the high school, right?
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:32.220]   I think, I mean, I think when you're 14, I don't know.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.500]   I don't know if you're mature or our kids will be mature enough to say, okay, going
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.700]   to public high school is good enough.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.060]   I think it's good enough.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.060]   Okay.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:49.100]   Well, just speaking from my own experience, I was attending public school at age 14 and
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.060]   frankly I was pretty miserable.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:58.620]   There was so much violence in my school and there were gangs, there were fights in the
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.620]   hallway.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.540]   Literally, I remember walking down the hallway trying to figure out how am I going to get
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:10.540]   to class when these girls are cat fighting, pulling each other's hair out, screaming,
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.940]   fist fights all the time.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.060]   How am I going to get to class safely?
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.260]   I think you were traumatized by that experience.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:23.900]   I was traumatized by that and so many other experiences with bullying and whatnot.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:32.420]   And I wasn't, although our school, our public school had advanced classes that I was fortunate
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:38.780]   to be in, I still feel like I wasn't being academically challenged as much as I could
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.540]   have and I wasn't comfortable in so many ways.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:49.340]   And I ended up switching to private school in 11th grade because I begged my parents
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.980]   to get me out of there.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.980]   Okay.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.700]   I have a solution for our debate and our dilemma.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.740]   And it's all about compromise.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.020]   So in any good compromise, one person gives a little, the other person gives a little.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.660]   Nobody gets what they want.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:10.340]   So since we have two children, what we should do is send one of our children to public school
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:15.500]   and another one of our children to private school and then we can do a test and see how
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.500]   they turn out.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   No.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.500]   Why not?
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.500]   No.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   Oh my God.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.500]   It's such a no brainer.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.180]   All right.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:30.460]   In conclusion, I say to all of you, the school matters, but I don't think it matters as much
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.540]   as we all think.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.660]   Over time, where we go to college, where we go to high school, middle school, elementary
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.940]   school, I think it's going to matter less and less because everything is online for
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.580]   free now.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.020]   And you just have to be aware of the changing times.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:51.060]   I think more public universities are going to dominate the rankings going forward because
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:57.060]   society as a whole is looking to be more inclusive of the middle class, the lower income and
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.060]   the poor.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   Like why wouldn't that be the right trend?
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.920]   So I think that trend will continue.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.860]   So for those of you looking to save money or who couldn't get into a lead private school,
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.160]   I think better times are ahead for you.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.380]   And at the end of the day, I don't really even think it matters because we have so many
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.780]   resources at hand to be able to live our lives better.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.460]   So thanks so much for listening.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:26.220]   And if you enjoyed this episode, we'd love a positive review because it'll keep us going.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.540]   And if it's a negative review, we probably will just take a long break.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.540]   Thanks a lot.
