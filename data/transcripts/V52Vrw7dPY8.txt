[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   - Not everybody enjoys the hunting and the searching.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.640]   I enjoy the thrill of the hunt, but not everybody does.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.440]   And if you don't have a lot of extra time to do it,
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.200]   then I think an award booking service
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800]   fills a really important need.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.920]   And I think your point that the amount of savings
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.160]   you can have in the sense that if you redeem your points
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.680]   just through the credit card portal,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680]   because you're like, "Oh, I don't wanna bother with this,"
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.280]   then you may be giving up $10,000 in value
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.160]   that you could have for just paying somebody
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.600]   a couple hundred bucks a person to book it for you.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.640]   - The award tools have come so far.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.440]   A lot of these discovery tools have made it so easy.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.640]   Three years ago, it would have been a lot more work.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.680]   It's like search every route, every date.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.720]   That's gotten a lot better.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.560]   So it might seem like a lot of work.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.480]   You might realize, "Actually, I could do
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.880]   some of this searching on my own pretty quickly."
