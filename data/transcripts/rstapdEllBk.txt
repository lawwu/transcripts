[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   The love of money is spiritual death.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   So, what does it look like when the love of money has been put to death in a heart?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   What does the antithesis of the love of money look like in a real life?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Thankfully, we get an incredible glimpse of this very thing in John chapter 12.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   There we read this.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   "Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume, but Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, he who was about to betray him, said,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   'Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?'
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and having charge of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Jesus said, 'Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.'"
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Here's Pastor John in a 2011 sermon to explain.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Jesus is inexpressibly wonderful, and Mary is inexpressibly affectionate.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   They match. That's beautiful.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   It's the point of the story.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Look, look Judas, look Bethlehem, look world.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Look, she's putting it on his feet.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   His dirty, smelly, human feet.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Why?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Because the least of Jesus is worthy of the best of us.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Look Judas, look Bethlehem, look world.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   She's wiping it off with her hair.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Why?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Why not a nice, clean, soft towel?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   That's what Jesus used a few hours later.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Do you remember how Peter responded in Luke 5
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   to the miraculous catch of fish at the word of Jesus?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Remember that?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   "We've been fishing all night, won't work."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Okay, you say throw it down, we'll throw it down.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And they pull up so much fish, two boats start to sink.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   What does Peter do?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   He falls flat on his face and says,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Jesus hadn't said a word about his sin.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   He just treated him super good.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Over the top good.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And in that presence of grace,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   so it works for me, I feel most unworthy.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I think Mary was just overwhelmed with what was there before her
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and how unworthy she was.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Jesus, cleanness and sweetness of aroma befits you.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Your purity and holiness and power and grace,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   sweetness and cleanness befits you.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   But as for me, odors and dirt befit me.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   My hair is the cleanest, most beautiful thing that I have.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And if I could serve to magnify your purity and your sweetness,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   it would honor me to turn my hair into a rag for your feet.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   This is a wonderful thing.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   This is a beautiful thing when the affections of a woman
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   match the worth of Jesus.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Look, Judas. Look, Bethlehem.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Look, world. Look at the room.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Verse 3, "The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Heartfelt, personal, intense, warm, affectionate, authentic worship
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   never stays private.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It will be out. Others will know it.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   They'll see it off your face if it was private in this room during corporate worship.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Meeting Jesus the way she met Jesus with this outflow of over-the-top affection
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   never is a merely private thing.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The fragrance of Christ can be smelled.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Lavish, heartfelt, sacrificial, grateful display of affection for Jesus
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   and everybody was blessed in the whole banquet.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Leave her alone.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I won't be around very long and I'm the issue here.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   My worth is the issue here.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   She sees it, you don't. She feels it, you don't.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Leave her alone. You don't understand at all what's going on here.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Judas, leave her alone, Judas, because the poor you always have with you.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Verse 8, "Judas, let me start by giving you the benefit of the doubt.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   You love the poor?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Guess what? The rest of your life, serve the poor.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   They're always going to be there.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   In fact, Judas, you better love the poor.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I love the poor.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   So, you may now feel free with no obstacle from Mary at all
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   to love the poor the rest of your days.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Go ahead.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Judas, I know you, you don't love the poor.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And you don't love me.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   You love money.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   In five days you'll sell me for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Listen, Judas.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Listen, Bethlehem.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Listen, world, to the Apostle Paul.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Where did he learn this?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Where did Paul learn this?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   We brought nothing into the world.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   We will take nothing out of the world.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   We have food and clothing.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   With these, we will be content.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   into a snare,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   into many hurtful and senseless desires
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   that plunge men into ruin and destruction.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And by this kind of craving,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   some have wandered away from the faith,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   oh Judas,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   and pierced themselves with many pangs.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   The love of money is suicidal.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Jesus said it.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Paul said it.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Judas proved it.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Do you love money?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Do you want to be rich?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   If you want to be rich, you're on a suicidal track.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Money is deadly.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I mean money, not just the love of it.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's deadly.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   We have to handle it.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   We have to make it.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We have to use it.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But like fire in our hands.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Judas, Bethlehem,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   if you can't see me and my worth,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   you're going to die
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and never see me again.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Wow, that is potent.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It's one of my favorite clips from the John Piper Sermon Archive.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It was preached on November 5th, 2011
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   in a message titled,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   "Leave Her Alone, Judas.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   This is for My Burial."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   You can find the entire thing at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And thanks for joining us today on the podcast for our feed, our archive,

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And that concludes episode number 1499,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   meaning our next one is episode 1500.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's incredible.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   90 months ago, 90 months ago,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   we started this little podcast.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   You started to listen and sending in questions,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and it all snowballed from there.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And here we are.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   God is so very kind to us.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And next time on Friday,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   we're going to get Pastor John back in the studio
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   and reminisce a little bit over the podcast,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   but to do it through the eyes of Pastor John
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   and what he's learned over these seven years
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   about his own rhythms and habits of productivity.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   That should be really interesting.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I am Tony Reinke.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   We'll see you next time for episode 1500 on Friday.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Take care.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   [end]
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   [end]
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   [end]
