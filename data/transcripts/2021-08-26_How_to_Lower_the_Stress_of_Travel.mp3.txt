[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.440]   My name is Josh Ruchites.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.440]   I am your host.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.080]   Today on the show, I want to share with you how to make travel less exhausting.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.600]   Now that's the title that I'm choosing to go with, but frankly, I could expand this
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.220]   title in a number of different directions.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.200]   How to make life less exhausting.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.340]   Let me begin with a story as to what stimulated me to think about this.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.320]   My family and I, my wife and our four young children, ages seven and under, are currently
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.360]   on a tour de monde.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.280]   We're traveling the world.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.120]   We have been traveling for several months now.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.620]   We started in Mexico.
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.480]   From Mexico, we moved to Costa Rica.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.620]   From Costa Rica, we moved to the United States for a few weeks, then from the United States
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.620]   to Europe.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.280]   We spent some time in Portugal.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.920]   Then we flew to Malta, spent several weeks on Malta, then back to Portugal.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.400]   In Portugal, I bought a car, and we have since traveled across the Iberian Peninsula into
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   France with some time in Spain, also in Andorra along the way.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.080]   We are now currently in France.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.480]   Over the past few weeks, I have enjoyed our travels.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.000]   It has been neat to take my children to some new destinations, show them some new things.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.280]   I keep a track, and so far this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.000]   We're now in our eighth country on this trip.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.080]   It's been really fun to see my children learn new things, do the world-schooling thing quite
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   a bit.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   It's been really neat.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.440]   We're driving across Spain.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   Look, there's a castle.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   Look, there's a castle.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   Look, there's a castle.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   It was really neat.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.600]   It was neat to be in Andorra and get a chance to show them the little alpine wonderland
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.440]   that is the little microstate of Andorra.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.560]   Now being here in France, it's been really fun.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.520]   It's also been very, very tiring.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.280]   And a few days ago, I was just kind of done.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.800]   I was sitting and talking with my wife, and I was feeling exhausted.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   And I don't usually get exhausted.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.240]   I'm one who enjoys a pretty good reserve of energy.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:43.920]   Consider myself to be fairly indomitable and not to pay much attention to how I feel.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   Just press forward.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560]   I have good stores of energy, et cetera.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.240]   I'm in good health.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   And I was just done.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.200]   And I started thinking and talking with her about why.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   Why do I feel this way?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.360]   And what I finally realized was that I was just worn out with making decisions.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.760]   I was worn out, completely and totally worn out with making decisions.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.320]   Let me describe this to you so you understand why.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.480]   In the style of travel that we have currently chosen, we are traveling in a very open-ended
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   way.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.520]   We started our trip, and we have no fixed dates on anything.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.120]   I have a list of a dozen or so destinations to which I'm trying to get for a dozen or
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.200]   so different reasons.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.480]   And I'm hoping to get to those.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720]   But if I don't get to them all, it's okay.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.240]   And if I get something different, I'm sure I'll find something interesting about that.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.280]   We have put all of our stuff in storage.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.560]   So we got some suitcases, and that's it.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.840]   Everything else is sitting in a storage locker.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.320]   And that's great.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.960]   We don't have any fixed location.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.040]   I honestly don't know where I'm going to be from day to day.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.360]   And our style of travel has been no forward tickets purchased, flying basically on one-way
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.920]   tickets into each place, choosing a hotel a few nights at a time, possibly as much as
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.880]   a week at a time.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   But really no plans beyond a week at a time.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.920]   And I love many things about this style of travel.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.360]   I enjoy the spontaneity.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.880]   I enjoy the sense of freedom.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.520]   I enjoy knowing that if things get bad here, I can go somewhere on the exact opposite side
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.480]   of the world and be there in less than 24 hours.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.920]   That's exciting to me.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.840]   I don't recommend this for novice travelers because there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.920]   and you have to learn to be okay with that.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.440]   But I've gotten pretty good, I thought, I think, at handling that sense of uncertainty.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:48.240]   But what is part of this travel lifestyle is you are continually making fresh decisions.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.440]   Let me describe a fairly typical day.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.480]   I wake up in the morning.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.400]   Usually I wake up early before my children.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.040]   My children all wake up at different times.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.360]   My wife usually sleeps a little bit later, but I usually wake up early in the morning
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.800]   and I spend time in the morning reading, thinking, writing, et cetera.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.200]   So where do I do that?
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.720]   Well, I like to get up and if we're in a hotel, go to the hotel lobby.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.440]   I like to find some beautiful place to be.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.520]   But then on a daily basis, what about the children?
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.360]   Do I stay in the hotel room so that I can engage them and keep them quiet and have more
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.840]   time for the others to sleep?
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.960]   Or do I just go and let my wife deal with it?
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.480]   Either works, but every day it's a new, fresh decision.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Where do I go this morning?
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.640]   How much longer are they going to sleep?
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.480]   What time do they go to bed, et cetera?
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   Then breakfast.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   Where are we going to have breakfast?
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   We're a breakfasting family.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.040]   Maybe in the future we'll be able to be a fasting family, an intermittent fasting family,
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.160]   but at the moment it doesn't seem to be the right decision for my children.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   So where are we going to have breakfast?
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   Are we going to have breakfast in the hotel?
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.280]   Are we going to have breakfast out?
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.880]   Well what breakfast is offered at the hotel?
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.880]   Is it a good deal?
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.120]   How much are they going to charge me for four little children?
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.940]   Are they going to charge me adult prices times six or are they going to give me a deal?
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.940]   And then what's available?
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.000]   Usually I don't know.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.440]   So do we just walk down the street or do we go and do I look in an app?
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   Do I pull up Yelp?
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.480]   Do I try to find out what's there?
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.220]   What do we do?
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.220]   Do we eat in the hotel room?
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.320]   Are we in the hotel room where we're going to have the children sit?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.640]   There's not enough, it just goes on.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.800]   What are we going to do this morning?
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.720]   Well I've got work, we've got school, we've got sightseeing.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.640]   What seems to be the best for today based upon where we are, based upon how much time
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.560]   we have, based upon the energy, based upon what's available?
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.320]   Then all of a sudden lunchtime rolls around and children need some food in their bellies.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.120]   So what's the best way to handle that?
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.160]   And then naps, are we going to do naps or are we going to not?
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.320]   And then the afternoon, same exact thing again.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   Where are we going to go out?
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.320]   Are we going to stay in?
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   What are we going to do and why?
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.280]   And then dinner, are we going to eat, etc.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   And then where are we going to be tomorrow?
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   And then at night everyone gets in bed and then I've got to think where we're going
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.160]   to be two days from now and why.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.060]   Now you can see when I articulate it in this way, there's a lot of decisions.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.560]   And it's basically at every step a new decision.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.720]   Sometimes it's a lot easier if your decisions are made for you.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:08.800]   For example, it would be in some cases easier if I were a totally bare bones budget traveler.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.040]   Well then I would just always stay in the cheapest hotel.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.520]   But I'm not a totally bare bones budget traveler.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.760]   I enjoy some luxury in my life and I enjoy some comfort for my family.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.680]   And so I usually try to choose a place that's kind of middle of the road, mixing some luxury
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.720]   exotic experiences with some low end experiences.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.020]   But then what's the right place for here?
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.040]   And so even just continually choosing a new hotel, it's exhausting.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.760]   Because I make that fresh decision of how fancy versus how simple, how big, should we
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.080]   go with a full house, do they have suites here, how do we know we're getting a good
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.200]   deal, should we get a small hotel?
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.280]   It just goes on and on and on.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.520]   On the food, same thing.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.200]   I like to enjoy the gastronomical, the local gastronomical scene.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.960]   Well, it's kind of annoying, you don't want to eat every meal in that way.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.640]   So you're continually making these decisions as the point.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   Do I work today?
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   Do I not work today?
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   If I work today, I can get something done.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.640]   But where am I going to go to work?
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.760]   Where am I going to get something done?
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.200]   It's really tiring.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.120]   It's really tiring.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.080]   And so what can you do?
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.560]   Well, first of all, you can solve this.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.880]   So once I realized what was happening, I very quickly I said, "Okay, this is why I'm really
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.960]   tired.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   We're going to stop some of the decisions for a while."
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.880]   And it had been at that time a particularly heavy period of decisions.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.280]   I just bought a car and there's everything associated with that.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.640]   Choosing a car, am I going to get this done?
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.760]   And what's the right thing for me?
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.920]   And how big and how small?
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.480]   And how much should I spend?
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.880]   And just how long am I going to use it?
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.320]   I don't know.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.000]   And so that was a whole extra set of decisions that were piled on.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.800]   So choosing a car was one thing.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.920]   But I quickly said, "Okay, what we need is we need some time."
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.800]   Now we've done some longer term rentals on this trip so far, but it had been a while,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   right?
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.160]   Because we've been traveling quite a lot and keep getting worried about new COVID restrictions.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   And so finally I said, "That's it.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.960]   We're just going to book a house."
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.040]   So I went and I booked a house for a month in France.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.360]   I chose a house, big house, plenty of room, plenty of beds, plenty of space outside for
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.320]   the children to run and said, "Okay, that's it."
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.120]   And immediately once I made the decision, there was a significant sense of peace.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.440]   I don't have to choose a hotel for a while.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.840]   I have it done for a month.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:40.360]   In addition, of course, I chose a house and the house means that you can buy groceries.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.680]   And instead of making do with your own food in a hotel room, you can buy groceries.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:52.240]   I don't just like to eat at home for some financial reason.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.600]   I find it just a genuinely better experience.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.080]   I don't enjoy going out to restaurants all the time.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.440]   I enjoy restaurants as, okay, an occasional thing, but it's just not fun.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.480]   I don't enjoy going out to restaurants all the time.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.120]   And then also here in Europe where sometimes the service is different than what you get
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.120]   in some other places, it's just a little bit annoying.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.240]   And so I prefer to be at home and so chose a house or it could be simple.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   There was also a significant improvement once I picked a car.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   Okay, done.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.000]   Got a car, done.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So we're going to change.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.680]   We're not going to spend so much time on airplanes.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   We're going to drive and we're going to have a house for a long time.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.800]   And that made everything improved.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.160]   So I've solved a significant amount of that stress.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.360]   I do think frequently, in fact, on an almost daily basis, I think about the long-term decisions.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.960]   I wonder, I ask myself, is this the best solution?
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.440]   And I would tell you, if you're thinking about long-term travels, long-term family travel,
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.640]   I want to try to describe accurately what it's like.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.000]   I'm not going to do that at all in today's show, but I want to describe accurately what
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.400]   it's like so that you can have some sense of whether it might be for you.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.560]   I like to go and test things myself and get a good sense of whether it is for me or not
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.080]   for me based upon trying stuff.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.040]   So I like to go and test things.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.280]   And I enjoy family travel.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.360]   I enjoy long-term family travel.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.200]   But I also see the value of not living this way as a lifestyle.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.800]   There are many times where I think about all the good things, about living a more conventional
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.240]   lifestyle, buying a house in the suburbs, settling down.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.600]   It doesn't feel like it when I was younger, probably would have felt like a failure.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.160]   Settling down is a failure.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.880]   I'm not living my principles of radical going for it.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.360]   But at this point, it doesn't feel that way.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.760]   It feels like that would be really nice.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.200]   That would be a really nice lifestyle.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.000]   It would be really enjoyable.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.320]   I understand more why so many people like it.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.120]   Not everybody living in a house in the suburbs is there because they're forced to be there.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.800]   It's a really nice lifestyle.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.480]   There's a very good chance that I'll end up doing that at some point in the future, perhaps
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.400]   even not too distant future.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   Nothing is decided.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.240]   At the moment, I have no idea where I'm going to be two months from now.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:18.040]   But I see the benefits of a stable, steady lifestyle.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.600]   By the way, this is not original with me.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.200]   For example, this is usually called decision fatigue.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:32.080]   There's this idea in success circles that if you can minimize the number of decisions
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.800]   that you make on small trivial things, then you can maximize the amount of energy that
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.080]   you have for larger, more important things.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.640]   Based upon my personal experience, I think there's some truth to it.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.120]   The common examples are usually, "Here's why so-and-so eats the same thing for breakfast
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.880]   seven days a week," or "Here's why Mark Zuckerberg wears a gray t-shirt and a pair of jeans and
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.640]   a hoodie every single day."
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.400]   The idea is he's only got so much reserves of decision-making power.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.960]   Willpower is often how it's talked about as well.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.920]   So by minimizing the need to choose what you're going to eat for breakfast, by minimizing
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.640]   the need to choose what you're going to wear, you have more time available for that really
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.720]   big important business decision or investment decision later in the day.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.920]   Maybe it's true.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.280]   I believe there's some truth to it, especially based upon my personal experience.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.880]   I'm not trying to go that far, but what I'll point out to you is that this lifestyle, this
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.720]   travel lifestyle, long-term travel lifestyle, is indeed, has a lot of decisions.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:37.360]   And I don't want to say it's stressful because I really feel like that word is overused.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.280]   I don't care to say, "Oh, this is stressful."
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.440]   I prefer not to say, "I'm stressing me out."
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.800]   I don't like that terminology.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.080]   I feel like it's weak and that most of the stuff is just not true, right?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.720]   This is not stressing me out.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:55.480]   I don't mind saying I feel stressed about this, but this cannot have any impact on me
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.880]   because I have full control over my mind and I'm never going to surrender the sovereignty
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:06.080]   that I have over my mind and give away my ability to think and to decide and to choose
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.000]   how I enter life to some external source.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   That's a ridiculous thing to do, to give some external thing, often an inanimate thing,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.320]   power over you.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.560]   The fact that my tire blew out is stressing me out.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   Nonsense, right?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.600]   The fact that your tire blew out was a simple fact that your rubber encountered some kind
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.200]   of object and now you have a flat tire and how you respond to that is entirely within
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   your control.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   There's no reason why it needs to stress you out.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.720]   So I hate to use that term stressing me out.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.600]   Sorry, personal rant there.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.920]   But there is a real truth to the fact that a continual travel lifestyle will generally
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.520]   involve a lot of decisions about things that you may not have to—a lot of decisions you
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.280]   may not have to make in other approaches to life.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.280]   And that is something that can be very tiring.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.440]   Again, I want to be careful.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.320]   Not totally tiring.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.800]   I find there's a sense in which it's energizing.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.280]   There is a sense in which it's energizing.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.940]   It can also be quite tiring, as I have experienced recently.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:20.120]   This also clarified to me why I like certain forms of travel more than others.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:28.520]   I think with tremendous fondness back on my time of traveling in an RV, especially with
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.240]   my children, we go through and look at pictures of the trip, try to help cement those memories
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   so they're not totally lost.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.000]   90% of them are lost, but we try to cement some of them with 10% by going back and showing
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.240]   the children videos and photos of our trips.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.400]   And I think with tremendous fondness on RV travel around the United States, like we did
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.000]   in 2018.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.920]   And I realized that this is one of the reasons why I love RV travel so much.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.560]   That when traveling in an RV, there are far fewer necessary decisions on a daily basis.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.380]   If you travel in an RV, although you are traveling, you always know where you're going to sleep.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.960]   You always know what bed you're going to sleep in.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.440]   And the cool thing about an RV is, in the majority of cases, it really makes no difference
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.280]   whether that bed happens to be parked on the side of a road somewhere, or in a friend's
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   driveway somewhere, or in a beautiful National Park campground somewhere.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.840]   It's just a bed.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.440]   Once you close your eyes, it all looks the same.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.880]   And I sleep just as well in a Walmart parking lot as I do in a beautiful private campground.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.480]   Now I enjoy my morning coffee differently in a beautiful National Park Service campground
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.600]   than I do in a Walmart parking lot, but my sleep is no different.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.640]   I don't have to make a fresh decision about what bed I'm going to sleep in.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.960]   Similarly, I don't have to decide what level of comfort is adequate for my family, because
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.560]   I've already made that decision.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.160]   I've already chosen, this is how large of a rig we want.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.800]   This is what level of comfort we want.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.680]   It's already done.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.840]   The only decision involved with RV travel is, where are we going to be tonight?
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.800]   And that's a very low stress decision when you know, no matter where we wind up, we have
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   an option.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.640]   In fact, this is something I love so much about RV travel.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.440]   There were several times on our trips that, for various reasons, we couldn't get where
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.200]   we wanted to go, and we just quite literally parked on the side of the road.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.560]   Found a spot that was safe, meaning away from the flow of traffic, no danger of being driven
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:41.040]   into in the middle of the night, safe in terms of any surroundings were appropriate, and
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.960]   then pulled over, parked, and went to sleep.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.240]   And that's such an awesome thing about RV travel.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.360]   It removes all of the stress for me from picking.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.760]   That's different than choosing hotels every couple of nights.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.320]   The other day, we were in Barcelona, and we were planning to be there.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.560]   I wanted to extend our stay slightly.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.960]   And so I went down, and usually in most hotels, I'll book, usually start with two nights,
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.040]   and then if I want to stay there longer, I'll usually go ahead and extend it.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.560]   But you always know they might not be able to.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.080]   In this case, I booked two nights, decided I wanted to extend for two more, went down
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.460]   to reception, asked to extend.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.600]   They didn't have any rooms available.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.640]   And so it was no problem.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.720]   I went up to the room, told my wife, "We got to go.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.240]   We got to check out."
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.480]   And we changed the whole plan.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.200]   I sat down on my bed and made some new reservations and moved on.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   So it wasn't that bad.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.040]   But you know, especially being a father with children, you know there's this continual
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   pressure.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   I'm not going to sleep in a bus station.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.320]   I can't sleep on the street.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   I need a hotel.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.640]   And if one is not available, I'm okay.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.560]   Whereas with an RV, everything is available.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.340]   You always know I have a bed.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.560]   And a bed is fine wherever I do.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.080]   If I can make it to Tucson, great, we'll go to Tucson.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.280]   If I can't make it to Tucson, no problem.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.040]   We'll just park short of Tucson.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.760]   And there's always a place to park.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.720]   And then we'll press on to Tucson tomorrow.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   No problem.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   Same thing with food.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.800]   That's the other thing is those continual decisions of where are we going to eat and
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.360]   how much are we going to eat.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   And you never know.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.360]   You're always in a new restaurant.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.880]   So you can't know reliably how much you need to order.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:21.560]   My general ordering principle with my children is I order a few dishes and then we share
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   them around.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.920]   I can't abide children's menus.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.460]   So I always order a few entrees and we share them around.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.400]   But when you're always in a new restaurant, you don't know the size of the entree and
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.240]   you're trying to dance this delicate dance between choosing an entree of a certain size
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.800]   and gauging the size of your children's stomachs.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.520]   And it's a little annoying and fine to do on occasion.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.240]   But when you do it three times a day, it's a little bit annoying, I find.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.560]   Whereas with the RV, you can always have food with you, which means that most of your meals
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.760]   you can prepare yourself, which means that you have more freedom to enjoy the dining
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:06.760]   experience as a dining experience rather than as a calorie ingestion experience.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.080]   And so it was really clarifying for me that I really, really like RV travel.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:18.160]   And I think the fundamental reason why I like RV travel is simply this.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.840]   It's having to make fewer decisions.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:31.680]   I have a hard time seeing how any family would want to do this kind of busy, busy, move,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:39.720]   move travel without some changes on an ongoing basis.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.040]   It's fine on vacation, right?
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.080]   It's fine for a week or two, although you're going to get home from the vacation pretty
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.820]   tired, I think.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.200]   It's fine and enjoyable in that situation.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.160]   And there are many places that I would love to see in that way.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.600]   But if you've been thinking about a travel lifestyle, I don't think that you want to
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.120]   move a lot.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.680]   So kind of from good to great.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.240]   I think the best thing is spend a little bit more time and book things probably a little
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.600]   bit farther ahead.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.120]   I think the strategy of choosing an Airbnb for two weeks and then having a few days of
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.140]   buffer and then having another one lined up for two weeks or however long, I think this
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.360]   is a really good strategy.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.440]   So you know you have those two weeks, you know where you're going to be at least for
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.440]   that significant time.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.800]   I like, I mean when I got to the house here, just felt totally relaxed.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.140]   All the decisions made, don't need to worry about a lot of the stuff going forward.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.640]   So I think that's kind of stage one.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.520]   I think stage two is better, is to have your own accommodation.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.440]   Whether that's a vehicle-based travel, right?
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.080]   An overlanding truck, an RV, a rooftop tent, something where you know you're going to be
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.960]   sleeping in the same place every day and having the ability to carry food or a sailboat also
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   would work.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:58.200]   I think these are far simpler and better models for probably all travelers, virtually all
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   travelers.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.880]   Again, not someone who needs to jet around the world continually, but for family, definitely
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.040]   the way to go.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.460]   And or the third thing is having bases, right?
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.720]   Your own house, your own house in a few different places that you return from and doing kind
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.080]   of a surge approach.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.920]   I think these are just much more appropriate styles of travel.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:28.800]   I do think that you can expand this concept beyond simply travel or even family travel.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:35.040]   I think that having a lifestyle in which most of your decisions are made, especially if
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.200]   those decisions become habits, habits that create and promote the kind of lifestyle that
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:46.040]   you want to have, really has tremendous benefits for many of us.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.240]   To have a place that you live that's stable, having good routines, frees up your creative
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.200]   mind in some cases.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.160]   This may be a delicate balance for some of us.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:03.080]   I personally, personality wise, I often get a little bored with that, without some fun
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.760]   and exciting challenges, changes, et cetera.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.080]   But I think for a lot of people, that's the best approach is just simply live in a fairly
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.020]   structured situation so that you don't have to make so many decisions and that frees up
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.400]   your creative energies for in a little bit more of a productive way.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.360]   I have not been as productive as I have wanted to be.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.820]   Part of it is infrastructure, right?
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.560]   You never know where am I going to be on a certain time.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.000]   The single thing I've solved most of the technology challenges.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.940]   I can work most places.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.080]   I can do that.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:42.040]   The thing I can't solve is simply the needs of my family.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.840]   And it's not like a, they're relatively, they're just normal, right?
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.920]   And so if I have a phone call scheduled at three o'clock, but we get an hour delayed
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.000]   schedule and I'm not sure where I'm going to be, I can't say, just sit here in your
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.680]   seat and do nothing for an hour while I step outside of the car and take a phone call.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.080]   And so when we're actually actively moving, I can barely take a phone call.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.360]   I can barely keep to a schedule, which is why I've tried to eliminate as much of that
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.480]   stuff from my schedule as possible.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.840]   But the point is that if you minimize the number of decisions you have to make on a
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.280]   regular basis, then I think that it really can free up a lot of mental bandwidth.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:24.520]   And it's provided me a clarifying theme to understand why it is that I personally like
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:30.080]   vehicle-based travel so much better than non-vehicle-based travel.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.480]   It's decision fatigue.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.320]   It's having the big decisions made.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.920]   Once I bought a car and we moved to car-based travel, much more relaxed.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   Again, hotel, right?
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.200]   Because you always know, "Well, if the one in the middle of town is full, I'll go on
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   to the next town.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   No big deal.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   I'll go outside of town."
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.400]   If you don't have your own car, that's a different proposition.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.680]   And so my stress level went down with the vehicle, bought a house, stress level went
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:02.640]   down, and here I am feeling good, ready to share this with you.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.920]   Hope that you enjoy this and look forward to talking to you in future days.
