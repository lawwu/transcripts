[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.860]   Welcome back to our show, Portfolio Rescue. This is our show where we answer questions
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.240]   directly from you, the viewer. I am Ben Carlson. Joining me, as always, is our producer, Duncan
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   Hill. Quick reminder, this show is for informational purposes only. It should not be relied upon
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.560]   for innovative decisions. We have to get that out of the way. Remember, we're just providing
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.420]   context and perspective here. If you have a question, email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.600]   We got a ton of good emails last week. I think we're going to be full up for a long time.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.160]   And remember, this is not just going to be me answering questions here. Each week, I'm
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.360]   going to be bringing on an expert, and I have an expert waiting in the wings here who's
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.080]   going to help me with some questions later on. But first, Duncan, what's going on? Question
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:04.460]   number one. Hey, Ben. Good morning, everyone. So first up today, we have the following.
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.260]   So first up, I have a question about saving versus investing. I'm a 26-year-old medical
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.280]   student and my wife and I are looking to buy a house in the next year or two. She's a teacher
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.160]   and makes around $50,000 pre-tax. I will be a resident next year and will make around
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.000]   $55,000 pre-tax. We currently have about $5,000 in a Roth and $11,000 in a Marcus account.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.220]   My wife has $7,000 in her 403(b) and we have no kids. Should I risk more of my savings
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.800]   in Marcus and invest it given how low rates are? Maybe a higher dividend ETF short-term?
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.960]   Okay, so this is a question that we get in some form or another dozens of times every
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.640]   month. It's partially because of the low-rate environment we're in, right? If you go to
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   a savings account, so I also have an account at Marcus. They are currently paying 0.5%,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.220]   half a percent in interest. So it's not like you can just get in your money market or savings
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.760]   account 4% or 5% like you could in the past. The way that I look at this is, what's your
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.080]   upside and what's your downside? Because we know risk and reward are attached to the hip.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.440]   So let's say you go out and take a little more risk and you can earn 5% extra per year
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.080]   as you're saving for down payment over the next year, two, three years. On $10,000, that's
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.000]   an extra $500 a year. So that's your upside if you can increase by 5%. Obviously, if you
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.920]   can increase by more than that, it's more. So if you're saving for a $20,000 down payment,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.200]   we're talking $1,000 a year that you could get extra by investing that money. So that's
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.160]   the upside. What's the downside? All right, Duncan, put up the S&P 500 table here that
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.520]   shows the amount of times it's positive and negative. So what I did here, I took the S&P
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.780]   500. So let's say you want to take more risk. Put this money in stocks instead of cash.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.160]   I looked over one, three, and five-year time horizons, rolling returns going back to 1926.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.880]   So on one-year basis, roughly three-quarters of the time, you're going to see positive
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.200]   returns historically. Three years, it's almost 85%. Over five years, you're getting closer
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.040]   to 90% of the time. So the odds are in your favor that if you hold even for five years
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.520]   if you're saving for a down payment, it's pretty good odds that you're going to see
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.680]   a positive return. Unfortunately, the downside here is, I looked at the worst returns in
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.160]   these periods, so the times you did have negative returns. The worst one-year return in history
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.720]   for the S&P 500, -68%. Over three years, you could have lost 81%. Over five years, 61%.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.640]   Now, to be fair, those returns are from the Great Depression. It's not exactly the best
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.080]   analogy here. That's the worst, worst, worst-case scenario. So let's say if you look more in
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.200]   modern times. This is since 1960, what I'll call the modern stock market. The worst one-year
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.760]   return was -43%. Over three years, the worst return was -41%. Over five years, still, you
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.920]   lost close to 30% in the worst return. So, stocks are still risky. If you want to spend
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.320]   that money when you need it and the stock market is crashing, you're kind of out of
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.200]   luck. So let's say, instead of the S&P 500, we looked at a 50/50 portfolio. So now I took
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.920]   the returns of the S&P 500, put them against the five-year Treasury, which is just an intermediate
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.200]   term government bond, and looked at a 50/50 portfolio. Now things look a little better.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.360]   So you split the difference. You do some in a safe bond. You do some in the stock market.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.600]   Over one year, you're positive 82% of the time. Over three years, 93% of the time. And
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   over five years, you're only down roughly 4% of the time. So your odds increase more,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.080]   kind of splitting the difference here. Again, you can have bad returns, though, in those
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.040]   negative times. The worst one-year return was 38%. The worst three-year return was a
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.120]   loss of almost 50%. And over five years, you still could have seen a 25% loss in a 50/50
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.160]   portfolio. Again, that's all Great Depression stuff, so let's look at the more modern times.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.560]   Since 1960, the worst one-year return for a 50/50 portfolio was close to 20%. Over three
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.360]   years, 8%. And surprisingly, over five years, you've never seen a down year for a 50/50
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.840]   portfolio over a five-year period since 1960. Not bad.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.480]   I understand why people want to take more risk here when they're saving for a down payment.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   You think you have all this money, it's just sitting there earning nothing. But I think
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.920]   you have to ask yourself, is the risk of potentially having a lower down payment worth it for having
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.280]   a potential to have a little bit more on the upside? If you can handle seeing that money
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.840]   evaporate 10%, 20%, 30% of it, when you need to spend it and have a lower down payment
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.660]   for the potential to have it be higher, I think that's kind of the balance you need
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.960]   to make. But you have to ask yourself, is it really worth it? For me, personally, if
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.840]   I have something that's coming up in three or four years, I don't like to put it in the
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.380]   stock market, because for me, it's not worth the risk.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.680]   Alright, Duncan, what have we got? #2.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.080]   Duncan: I was just going to add, a while back, Nick Majuli did a good post, I can't think
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   of the name of the title, you might remember it, but where he was breaking all this down,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.300]   saving over the long haul and the best allocation.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.000]   Over the long term, you're much better off in the stock market. Over the short term,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.480]   who knows? If you had to spend your money in March 2020, the stock market was down 35%
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.560]   in a handful of weeks, and then you're out of luck.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.320]   Yeah. Alright, so next up, if I believe that the baby boomers are shifting from net investors
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.920]   or savers to net withdrawers, what is the investment strategy that I should take? Should
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.900]   I favor bonds and gold over the stock market, or try to pick the winners that boomers will
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.200]   direct their money towards? Healthcare, golf courses, Russian nesting dolls, etc. I have
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.080]   been going through this thought experiment, but I want to see if my thinking is on the
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   right course.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.160]   Alright, here's my next big short for baby boomers, when they're sort of out of the picture.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.320]   I'm shorting whitey tighties. Duncan, do you think that there is a single male in America
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.960]   under the age of 60 who still wears white underwear with the blue and gold around the
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   elastic band, right?
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   Yeah, I would short that.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.200]   I'm going mega short on whitey tighties. Okay. For real, though, this is an interesting question,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.040]   because we've never really seen anything like this. In the year 1900, there was 3.1 million
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.760]   people over the age of 65. By 2030, it'll be closer to 70 million, because that's the
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.560]   whole baby boomer generation. By 2030, we'll be over 65. 20% of the population will be
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.760]   over the age of 65 by 2030. Duncan, throw up this demographic chart I got from the U.S.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.400]   Census here. Look at this growth in people that are older in their years, so in the '60s,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.600]   '70s, and '80s, where we're headed from 1960 to 2060. We've just never seen anything like
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.880]   this before. Not only having such a large cohort of a demographic be this old, but people
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.760]   live this long. Here's why I'm not worried about baby boomers crashing the stock market.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.560]   There's this report from Stanford Center on Longevity. They say one-third of baby boomers
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.360]   have no money saved for retirement. And those who do have a positive retirement balance,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.240]   the median balance is around $200,000. Baby boomers are living longer. They're going to
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.200]   need two, three, maybe four decades for their money to last in retirement. They're going
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.280]   to need to hold more stocks, because interest rates are so low. So, people are worried about
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.080]   them selling all their stocks. I'm not worried about that. I think a lot of people are going
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.240]   to have to either work longer or invest their money more aggressively. And you have the
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.320]   fact that the top 10% -- there was a new study in the last couple of weeks -- the top 10%
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.240]   in this country own 89% of the stocks. Unfortunately, most of that money is going to be passed down
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.440]   to their rich kids. It's not going to be sold. A lot of these people that own the stocks
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.000]   aren't going to have to sell it. And also, someone's going to have to buy those assets
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.640]   from the boomers that do sell. Millennials are now the biggest generation. Gen Z is going
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.020]   to be bigger than the baby boomers by the end of 2030. And if we break up the population
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.120]   into these five-year age brackets -- the census does this -- the top 10 ages in 2030 will
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.440]   all be under the age of 50. So, even though we have so many more people getting older,
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.880]   we also have millennials and Gen Z coming in to buy those stocks from them. So, I'm
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.640]   more worried about how we're going to care for this aging generation that's going to
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.480]   have a long retirement. Again, back in 1900, when there was only 3.1 million people over
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   the age of 65, their retirement plan was to die on the farm. Now, people actually have
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   decades ahead of them in their working years, if they retire in their 60s or even 70, where
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.600]   they could have two, three decades ahead of them. So, I'm more worried about how we're
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.560]   going to take care of these people than them crashing the stock market. I'm not that worried
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.160]   about that. What do you think, Duncan? How do we short whitey tighties? Is it Hanes?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.760]   Yeah, I guess. But they make a lot. I feel like we could find a more concentrated bet.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.520]   That's true. Plus, Michael buys all of their white V-neck, so that might offset it. Alright,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.520]   next question.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:33.960]   Okay. So, next up. I recently secured an interest-only loan for my first home in L.A. It required
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.360]   30 percent down, but I have 2.125 percent locked in for seven years. I find this attractive
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.480]   as I believe I can meet or beat that with returns in the stock market without having
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.440]   to pay down the principal yet. And it gives me more flexibility to potentially move in
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.600]   seven years if this isn't my forever home. Assuming the ROI on appreciation would be
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.100]   greater than the interest paid during this window. What are your thoughts on interest-only
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.440]   mortgages versus building equity in a traditional 30-year mortgage?
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.920]   Alright, I personally have always been a fixed-rate guy, because I'm a planner. But I'm going
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.240]   to bring in someone else here. So, one of our financial advisors, a member of our investment
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.040]   committee, Blair Ducanet, to help me on this. Because I know she's talked about interest-only
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.120]   loans. She's worked with this. She's talked to clients about this. Blair, what are some
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.560]   pros and cons of the interest-only loan versus a fixed loan? That's the only thing I really
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.880]   have experience with personally.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.720]   Yeah, absolutely. Hey, guys. Great to be here. Thanks for bringing me in. Duncan, good to
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.240]   see you. Yes, absolutely. Interest-only loans get a really bad rap because a lot of people
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.800]   got into trouble in 2008-2009 when home prices declined. But putting 30 percent down gives
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:44.680]   you a really nice cushion in equity. And with rates so low and the fact that home prices,
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.840]   yes, they've had a big jump recently. But over the long term, we expect home prices
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.440]   to kind of match the rate of inflation, not necessarily keep pace with inflation. A lot
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.160]   of people are asking, "Why would I park more of my capital in home equity if I expect other
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   things to grow faster?"
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.800]   Right. So, the idea is you literally are only paying the interest, right? You're not paying
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   down the principal at all.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   Exactly.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.520]   So, you're not building equity. But then maybe your payment is a little smaller, so you can
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.920]   put that money to use elsewhere. That's kind of the idea here, right?
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   Yes.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.120]   We have to stop putting our net worth into different buckets. It's all one balance sheet.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.760]   And if your idea, if your goal is to increase your net worth, you might not want to be parking
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.080]   more and more of your capital into home equity with the expectation that home prices are
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.320]   going to basically increase with the rate of inflation. So, 30 percent down gives you
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.480]   a very nice cushion. Your home price would have to decline by more than 30 percent for
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.520]   you to "lose money on the sale." And this questioner points out another good point,
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.720]   which is the seven-year time period is the average holding period for a house. Very few
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.040]   people are staying in a house for 30 years. So, this 30-year fixed-rate mortgage really
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.440]   doesn't make sense for a lot of people.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.200]   And I want to give you a personal example. I am, this actually tomorrow will be seven
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.840]   years since I purchased the current house I live in. I knew it was not my forever house.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.560]   It's a smaller home. I thought that I would be moving to a bigger house now. It might
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:17.120]   be a year from now. I did a seven-year adjustable rate mortgage. So, I got a lower rate than
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.740]   the 30-year rate at that time, fixed for seven years. And oh, by the way, it's adjusting
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.840]   next month and it's adjusting down over one percent because interest rates went down.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.180]   Now, that's the thing. If you looked historically, you would have been better off doing this
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.560]   almost every year. Duncan threw up the chart on mortgage rates because all they've done
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.720]   is go down, right? So, you'd have been better off doing this in recent years, correct?
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   Now, I'm not saying that I knew what interest rates were going to be doing. In fact, I kind
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.640]   of baked in the fact that I thought interest rates would be higher in seven years. However,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.280]   the interest that I have saved over the last seven years would more than make up for paying
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.880]   a little bit more, right? Because remember, that seven-year adjustable rate that I got
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.920]   seven years ago was lower than the 30-year fixed rate, right? So, I've already saved
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.760]   the money. Even if I pay a little bit more for the next two years, I don't have a crystal
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.720]   ball. I do have a magic eight ball. So, if you guys want to ask a yes or no question
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.140]   about interest rates, we can. Nobody knows the future, but when you're shopping for a
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.480]   mortgage today, generally, you get a lower rate on interest only. You get a lower rate
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.640]   on adjustable rate loans. Be realistic about your holding period for this house and be
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.960]   a little bit more sophisticated with your choice in interest in mortgage loans.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.240]   Yeah. So, obviously, pros and cons. I do like the idea of if you know you're a younger person
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.520]   you're going to be trading up in a number of years. This seems to make more sense because
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.080]   most of that mortgage payment is going to go to interest in the first few years anyway.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   So, that makes sense. Correct.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.160]   All right. Duncan, what do we got next?
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:47.000]   Okay. So, last question. So, question four. This is an interesting one, and I'm going
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.720]   to ask you to explain to everyone what this acronym even means after I read this. But,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.080]   "I work for an employee-owned company with an ESOP benefit and may generously give each
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.240]   employee 10 to 15 percent of their salary in company stock/shares each year. It varies
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.160]   every year, but it's typically at the higher end of that range. So, if I'm making $100,000
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.200]   in salary, my employer will give me around $10,000 in stock on top of that. I also have
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.840]   the option of contributing to a 401(k), which I do. Assuming the ESOP contribution from
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.920]   my employer will be taxed after retirement, would you recommend that I put all of my 401(k)
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.440]   contributions in after tax?"
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:28.300]   Okay. So, ESOP stands for Employee Stock Option Plan. And this is, if you have the ability
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.960]   to work for a company that pays out stocks, this is nice. I just had a family member recently
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.520]   start working at a new public company, and she told me, "They're going to offer me a
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.960]   10 percent discount off of my shares in the company." So, what's the mix I go between
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.800]   my 401(k) and company stock? So, Blair, what are the things that you should be looking
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.520]   for here? What are the considerations when thinking through this idea of splitting between
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.760]   a 401(k) or taking stock in the company?
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.680]   Yeah. So, it sounds like in this case, the employee doesn't have a choice. They're going
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:01.000]   to receive 10 to 15 percent of their salary in employer stock. Generally, an ESOP plan
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.120]   is for a private company, and it's a very tax-efficient way for the owners to sell off
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.020]   a portion of their shares and also, by the way, enrich their employees. So, it's a wonderful
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.600]   benefit if the company is successful. I've actually seen this work out to clients' favors
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.160]   many times, and they end up with a net worth much higher than they ever would have assumed
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.640]   just from saving on their own. So, this is a wonderful benefit. You are right. All of
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.160]   your shares in the employee stock ownership plan, the ESOP, will be taxed when you take
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.000]   it out later in retirement. You have no Roth option here. We always talk about in financial
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.240]   planning building these different buckets of savings, and by buckets, we mean regular,
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.420]   deferred, going to be taxed when you take it out in retirement, Roth after tax, free
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.240]   and clear, no tax inside the account and no tax when you take it out later, and after
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:56.440]   tax savings, no deferral of any income. You pay taxes on the interest that comes in along
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.280]   the way. So, the question is getting to building the different buckets here. The Roth option
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.260]   in the 401(k) may be the right decision to try to build more of that Roth bucket because
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.000]   you have no choice in the employer stock option plan.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.960]   Right. So, the Roth offsets the stocks you're getting, which, again, I think is a good problem
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.420]   to have if you're someone who's getting this, because, as you mentioned, this isn't something
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.760]   everyone can receive, whether you're for a public or private corporation. This is a good
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.200]   problem to have. But yeah, you're looking at an offset, right? Because you know you're
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.040]   going to be paying taxes on the stock for the company, which is a good problem to have
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.680]   if that grows, you're doing great and you're working out better than most people, but you
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.440]   still want to have some sort of an offset, so you're not paying taxes on the Roth 401(k).
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.880]   I told, in our last episode, I told Bill Sweet, our CFO and tax expert, he talked me into
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.240]   switching to a Roth this year for the first time because I have more traditional retirement
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.320]   assets. So, it seems to make sense to have -- the way I look at it, you talk about buckets,
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.240]   it's like diversifying your tax base, right? You have some options.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.480]   Yep. It gives you more flexibility in retirement as to where to take your income. The questioner
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.460]   also noted their age, which is important. The younger you are, the more beneficial to
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.840]   making the Roth contributions, because keep in mind, when you make a regular 401(k) contribution,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.400]   you take a tax deduction this year. You get a tax write-off, you get that benefit, right?
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.040]   With a Roth, you don't. You're paying the tax up front today, and you need more time
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.520]   for those dollars to grow, so it is important. It makes less sense as you get older. It also
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.620]   makes less sense if you have a really high income, you're in the top federal bracket,
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:32.920]   maybe you also live in a high state income tax state, so you also have to look at what's
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.560]   your income tax rate today, what is it likely to be in the future. Again, we can ask the
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:43.720]   eight ball. We don't know, so there is a trade-off there, but generally, it's a good idea to
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.680]   be building these three buckets, regular deferred, Roth, and after-tax savings.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.960]   Perfect. By the way, in the comments here, someone says that Duncan still has the newly-wed
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.880]   glow. Duncan, one of these episodes, we're going to have to do some financial advice
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.040]   for newly-weds here. For coming on the show and helping us out here.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.360]   Yeah, thanks for having me. It's a fun time.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.880]   These questions are a little outside of my area of expertise. Duncan, as always, remember,
