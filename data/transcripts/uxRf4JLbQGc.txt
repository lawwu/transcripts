[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060]   Suppose the Third Reich had survived, maybe it had stopped at the point you were talking
[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.800]   about where the German lands were reconstituted.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.200]   Suppose that had happened.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.520]   If you look at the Soviet Union, Stalin kills more of his people than Hitler had by that
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.520]   point.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   I wonder if we have sort of burnished Stalin's reputation a little bit because we had to
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.000]   ally with him in World War II, but then the cycle we see in the Soviet Union is the inherent
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.040]   corruption and inefficiency of the totalitarian system, and then it breaks down, and there's
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.400]   reform because people realize how crazy things have been.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.100]   If the Third Reich had survived, would we see that same cycle there where the system
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100]   breaks down?
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.000]   And would we also remember them the same way as the Soviet Union, where it was so evil,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.240]   but at some point you just can't sustain that level of craziness forever?
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.920]   I suspect it would be worse.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.920]   Why?
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.320]   Because the Germans are far more efficient than the Russians were in those days.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.040]   And what is it, Nadezhda Mandelshtam, she was married to the poet Osip Mandelshtam,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.840]   and she was talking from the prison camps and saying, "Well, at least it's Russians
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200]   doing this because if it were Germans, there'd be no hope.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.960]   With Russians, there's always a hope because they're inefficient."
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.280]   And she's Russian talking about it.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.000]   Hitler is, he's talking about annihilating entire peoples.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And so is Stalin with killing off the Ukrainian, entire classes of Ukrainians.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.320]   Well, his idea is the Ukrainians need to pretend they're Russians, and then they can, that's
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.280]   fine if they do that.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.220]   The question you're asking is, it's not a happy ending, what you're describing.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.880]   It's a horrendous ending.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.600]   What is a scenario in which both Hitler and Stalin could have been defeated in World War
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   II?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   Is there some system of alliances or counterfactual where that happens?
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.040]   I think the problem is World War I.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   World War I has enormous consequences.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.220]   It is the West, in fact, all sides allowed their generals to make strategy.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.120]   No one is doing grand strategy in World War I.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.160]   It's all about operational success.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.520]   This is what we're all going to do.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.360]   And then the generals keep sending people waves and waves of young men up over the trenches.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.040]   And what do you think is going to happen to them if you send them over the trenches?
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   This is how you get these horrific death rates.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.120]   Hundreds of thousands in a battle, in our own day, it's inconceivable.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.040]   As a result of that war, not only does it upend Europe by getting rid of the Austro-Hungarian
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.720]   Empire, the German Empire, the Russian Empire gets rid of all of those.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   And so you have massive power vacuum.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.040]   And it puts two really pernicious ideologies on steroids, fascists and communists.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.840]   And that's how you get all that evil, is out of a gross mismanagement of World War I.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.240]   Once they're off and running, you've got problems on your hands, and you've got a long solution.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.600]   So back to your initial question, does grand strategy matter?
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.800]   Yes, it does.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.260]   Look at World War I when they didn't practice it.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.320]   And when the civilians, they allowed the officers to make all decisions.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.960]   Britain is a country that is marathoned by geography.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.080]   Britain built a continental-sized army.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.800]   That is not Britain's great strength in World War I.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.400]   And it was the beginning, the loss, the victory in World War I, but at horrific cost, was
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.840]   the beginning of the end of the British Empire.
