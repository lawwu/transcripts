[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:22.440]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, verses 12 and 13. But as many as
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.080]   received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.900]   on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.400]   of men, but of God.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.720]   Now here is this striking statement which the Apostle makes at the very outset and in
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.840]   the very introduction and prologue to his Gospel. In other words, he is anxious to remind
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.040]   these Christian people to whom he wrote his Gospel that the main object and intention
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.400]   of the coming of the Son of God into this world, the purpose behind the fact that the
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.280]   word was made flesh and dwelt among us, is that those who believe on his name might become
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.680]   the children of God.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.400]   And what we are doing at the moment is to look at this great statement, because this
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.720]   is meant to be a fact. It is a fact. All who truly believe on him do become the children
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.360]   of God. And we are looking at this in this experimental manner. The main trouble, it
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.440]   seems to me, more and more with the Christian Church today, the thing that accounts for
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.560]   our ineffectiveness and our weakness and our own personal individual troubles, is that
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.880]   we are not certain and sure, as we should be, of the fact that we are the children of
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.880]   God.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.680]   It is a very sad state in a family when a child does not realize fully what he is and
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.520]   who he is and what are his privileges, because he is a child of the family. And as we have
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.040]   been seeing, most of the New Testament itself is given to giving those who have already
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.720]   believed assurance. This is necessary because the devil, our adversary, is always trying
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.600]   to rob us of this joy, always making us look at ourselves instead of the Lord, turning
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.160]   us inwards, keeping us under the law. But as John has reminded us, the law was given
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.840]   by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. We are no longer under the law. The
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.440]   law worketh rough. Or as the Apostle Paul put it, you saw there this morning, in the
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.560]   fifteenth verse of the eighteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, "We have not
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.200]   received the spirit of bondage again to fear." That is what we have under the law. But "Ye
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.440]   have received the spirit of adoption, whereby ye cry, Abba, Father."
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.880]   Well now then, what we are trying to do is this. We are trying to show how we can tell
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.040]   for certain whether we are the children of God or not. To me, there is nothing under
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   heaven this morning that is more important for us than to know just that. It does not
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.600]   matter, you know, what may happen in the future if you know you are a child of God, for then
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   you will know that nothing will ever be able to separate you from the love of God which
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.080]   is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Neither life, nor death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.200]   nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.680]   creature. Nothing can ever separate you from this relationship to God in Jesus Christ our
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.160]   Lord. So I am arguing that nothing is more important
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.080]   for us than to be certain that we are children. How do we do that? Well, I have suggested
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.840]   that we take the human analogy. The first thing we have to make sure is that we really
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.920]   do believe on the name of the Son of God. If you have any doubts about his deity and
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.680]   his person, you are not a child of God. If you are not clear about his atonement, that
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.240]   he shed his blood upon the cross because he was there bearing you a punishment and the
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.760]   guilt of your sins, you are not a child of God. You believe on his name. That is the
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.200]   first thing. We must see who he is and what he has done for us, and how it is through
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.920]   him alone that God adopts us. All the blessings of God come to us in and through this person,
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.080]   his only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Very well, we have considered that.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.920]   Then we have gone on to consider our relationship to the Father. There are certain things always
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.000]   that a child is aware of in his relationship to his Father. We have been looking at them
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.720]   in our relationship to the Almighty God. Then we have moved on to the third, which is our
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.640]   relationship to the Holy Spirit. If we are children of God, we are in this relationship
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.040]   to the Son, the Father, and the Holy Ghost. At the moment we are examining our relationship
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.120]   to the Holy Spirit. Now let me explain exactly what I am doing, lest there be any confusion
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:46.640]   here. My thesis, my whole case is this, and it is the case, of course, that is unfolded
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:53.880]   in such profusion in the pages of the New Testament, that there are many, many signs
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.360]   of our being children. Again, take the human analogy, a child in a family. There are many,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.160]   many grounds on which that child knows that he is a child of the parents. Well, it is
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.120]   exactly the same in the Christian life. So what I am doing is to give you a large number
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:21.600]   of signs or of tests with this object and intention, not of necessity that you may be
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.880]   able to find all these signs in yourself, all together at the same time. I am not suggesting
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:36.760]   that of necessity. Neither am I suggesting, and far from suggesting, that you should find
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.200]   all these signs and tests present in you in all their fullness, because you will not find
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   that. None of us is perfect. What I am trying to show is this. I am giving the picture of
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:57.760]   the child as it were the ideal child. But, thank God, though we may not have reached
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.480]   full maturity and though we may not be aware of all these things in ourselves in all their
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   fullness, if we are aware of any one of them, really, definitely, and certainly, if we are
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.520]   aware of something of all of them in some degree, however small, that is enough in and
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:25.640]   of itself to prove that we are children. Because an imperfect child is still a child.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   Now, I am saying all this because I know already the devil is to come along and to trip us.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:40.000]   These tests that I am putting before you have a double object. The first is that we all
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.760]   may examine ourselves, because, as we know, it is possible for the devil to delude us
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.220]   and to make us think we are children when we are not children. Very well, I am giving
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.920]   you the tests in order that we may be able to know for certain. Yes, but I realize that
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.040]   as I am doing this, the devil may come along, and does come along, and twist it to his own
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:07.800]   advantage. While I am trying to show to those who are not children and who think they are
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.200]   that they have never been children, the devil may use that to shake the faith and the confidence
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.440]   of those who truly are children. He will take the picture at its maximum, at its perfection,
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.840]   and he will say, "You are not like that, therefore you are not a child at all." Now
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:30.680]   then, I am saying that the answer to that is this. You need not be perfect to be a child
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:37.360]   of God. But the vital question is this. Are there any evidences of the fact that you are
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:47.840]   a child in you? Incomplete, inchoate, undeveloped, unworthy in many respects? Very well, the
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:57.160]   question is, are they there? Yes, indeed, let me put it like this. You may be very dissatisfied
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:04.720]   with yourself. That in itself is a good sign. The Pharisee is never dissatisfied. He is
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.560]   the man who steps forward and says, "I thank God that I am not a Zolombe now, and especially
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.480]   this publican." That is the spirit of the Pharisee. My dear friend, the fact that you
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.640]   are dissatisfied is in itself indicative of the fact that you are a child. Any feeling
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.520]   of unworthiness and dissatisfaction is a very good and a very healthy sign. So if the devil
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.800]   comes to you and says, "Ah, well, there are the signs of a child, and you have not
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   got them perfectly." You say, "No, I have not got them perfectly, and that is what worries
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.480]   me. And because I am worried about it, therefore I am a child. There is something of it in
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:44.440]   me. Otherwise I would not be worried at all." Very well, let us bear that in mind. I am
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:51.040]   giving, I say, the largest possible number of tests in order that we may test ourselves
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:10:01.160]   by them. My principle is that these essential characteristics of the child are only found
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:09.200]   in the child. They are not found in anybody else. This relationship is a peculiar one.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:17.880]   So that if you have this, the characteristics of this relationship, however incompletely,
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:24.600]   you are a child of God. You may be a very small one, you may be a very young one, nevertheless
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:32.680]   you are a child as certainly and as definitely as the mature, developed, grown-up adult child.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:38.240]   Now then, let us proceed. The next test, therefore, we come to in the relationship of the child
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:45.880]   of God to the Holy Spirit is this one, that he is aware of being led by the Spirit. There
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:54.120]   it is, Romans 8, 14, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:02.920]   God." Now that is quite specific, is it not? You notice that the apostle there in that
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:09.320]   eighth chapter spends most of the time in the first half of the Inuit in drawing a contrast
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   between those who are in the Spirit and those who are in the flesh. That is it. That is
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.800]   another way of saying the difference between those who are children of God and those who
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.120]   are not children of God. That is the great distinction. "The law of the Spirit of
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.560]   life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." That is true
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:36.440]   of every Christian, not only of some, that is true of every Christian. Every Christian
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:42.680]   is dead to the law, finished with it, died with Christ to the law. He is now in the realm
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.000]   of the Spirit. And so the apostle goes on to give us some
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.840]   of the characteristics of life in the flesh, life in the Spirit. And here is one of them.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:05.000]   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." Now then, are
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.920]   you led by the Spirit of God? If you are, you can be certain you are a child of God.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.280]   Well then, what does it mean? You see, that is the thing. How easy it is to read these
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.720]   phrases, but we have got to work them out. We must know that we are led by the Spirit
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.080]   of God. What does it mean? Well, let me suggest some of the answers to you. The word "led"
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:37.720]   is a strong word. It means a constraining influence. Now that is very important. To
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:44.520]   be led by the Spirit of God does not just mean that your hand is taken hold of loosely
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.240]   and in a more or less detached manner. No, there is a sense of constraint about it. It
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.960]   is in the word. I am not saying this. Everybody has agreed about this. It is a strong word.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.200]   It means, "As many as are aware of the constraining influence of the Spirit, they
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:07.640]   are the children of God." Now, what do I mean by this constraining influence? Well,
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:15.960]   I mean, obviously, a pressure. There is a firmness there. You are aware that the hand
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:22.560]   is upon your shoulder, as it were, or taking it in terms of a horse driven by reins. Well,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.760]   the horse knows that the master is holding the reins, not some frightened child or servant.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:36.440]   There is a power in the grip, a constraining influence, a sense of control, a pressure.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.840]   I like to think of it in terms of a pressure. So this means, obviously, that we are aware
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.200]   of the companionship and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. I do not want to stay with
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.000]   this this morning. I really dealt with it in passing last Sunday morning when I said
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.680]   that the Christian is aware, it does not matter how completely, but he is aware that there
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:07.080]   is an influence in his life, a presence. And so, you see, the New Testament talks a lot
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.600]   about the fellowship or the companionship of the Holy Spirit, the grace of the Lord
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:18.080]   Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship, the companionship of the Holy
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.800]   Spirit. Well, you cannot be led by the Spirit without being aware that he is there and that
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:30.120]   he is with you, and that he is guiding you and leading you. Now, how does he do this?
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:36.720]   How do we become aware of his presence and of his pressure, his constraining influence
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:46.680]   upon us? Well, now it is like this. Now, do hold in your minds this matter of degree.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:53.000]   The pressure can be so slight that you are almost not aware of it, or it can be tremendous
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.200]   and overwhelming, but anything in between that slightest and the maximum is all true.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:06.960]   Hold on to that. If you are aware of the slightest constraint, the Spirit is there and you are
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.520]   a child of God. Now then, how does it manifest itself? Well, I have divided it up like this,
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.560]   into two main groups, general and particular. The general constraint and pressure of the
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:31.680]   Spirit. How? Well, in upbraiding us, in convicting us. In other words, the Christian is aware
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   of the fact that he is not left alone. He is tempted to backslide. He is living in a
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.160]   world that is against him. He is always up against the world, and the flesh, and the
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:48.400]   devil. And oh, in this modern world, with its newspapers and television and a thousand
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   and one things, how easy it is to fall away, as it were, in mind and in thought from our
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.960]   position. And we are all tempted to that, and we may yield to the temptation, though
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:06.120]   we are children of God. But if you are a child of God, you will not be allowed to go on like
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.720]   that. You will not be allowed just to go on enjoying that. You will be disturbed, you
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.480]   will be upbraided, you will be convicted, and you will be annoyed at the conviction,
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.280]   like a child always is, a misbehaving child. Having a wonderful time, a parent suddenly
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.200]   comes in, and the child is furious, of course, but it does not matter. The parent, because
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.520]   he is the parent of that child, comes in and disturbs that child. And if you and I are
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.960]   children of God, the Holy Spirit will come and upset us, and spoil the enjoyment, and
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.120]   convict us, and upbraid us. And we may feel recalcitrant, we may feel rebellious, it does
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.920]   not matter. He will not leave us alone. Why? Well, because if you are a child of God, God
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.000]   has chosen you. What has He chosen you for? That you might be made conformable to the
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.120]   image of His dear Son. And whether you want it or not at the moment, if you are a child
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:07.400]   of God, God is going to bring you there. He is going to bring you to the place He has
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.720]   designed for you. He has predestinated you, that you might be conformed to the image of
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:19.400]   His dear Son. And if you will not come willingly, well, He will make you come. He will chastise
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   you, He will whip you. He has many ways of doing it. I must not go after that this morning.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.600]   Sometimes illness, sickness, sometimes accident, misfortune, loss of money. He can do it in
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.520]   a thousand and one ways. But if you are a child of His, well, the Spirit will upbraid
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:42.120]   you and He will convict you and He will disturb you. Do you know anything about that? Now,
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:48.280]   the good moral man knows nothing about that at all. That is an absolute division. He just
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.480]   does not know it. He may feel a twinge of conscience now and again. He may feel he is
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   not living up to his standard and so on, but it is an essentially different thing. The
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:08.560]   Christian has the sense that this other, the companion, the Holy Spirit is dealing with
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.520]   him, checking him, convicting him, making him see what he is doing, making him feel
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:19.480]   ashamed, urging him to repent and to go back to God. He is always doing it. Very well,
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.320]   there is one part of it. And another thing, and this is very general, this is my general
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:33.440]   heading. The Holy Spirit disturbs our lethargy. I suppose our greatest trouble, most of us,
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:43.240]   is lethargy, laziness. The Church is full of lazy Christians. Compare the activity of
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.440]   men and women in the business realm and in professional realms, or in connection with
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.880]   their enjoyments. Contrast all that with the life of the Church. Look at the enthusiasm
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:19:00.360]   and the zeal of these people with their football and various other things. They are not put
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:09.400]   off by the snow, are they? They are not frightened by a little frost. They do not jump at the
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:20.560]   slightest excuse. Of course not. But look at God's people. Lethargy, laziness, indolence.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:31.080]   Thank God the Holy Spirit disturbs us and He shakes us. It is a fearful thing to fall
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:37.000]   into the hands of the living God, my friends. If you are a child of God, believe me, you
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.280]   will not be allowed to get away with your lethargy and your laziness. You are not only
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.600]   depriving yourself of something of the riches of God's grace, you will have to pay for
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:56.680]   it in other ways also. Here is all this glorious fullness. How much do we know about it? How
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:03.960]   ignorant we are. That is because we do not apply ourselves. Thank God that the Spirit
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:11.120]   does not allow us to remain in our lethargy and our laziness. Thank God that He disturbs
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.440]   us and rouses us to action. He does, and He will go on doing it, because He is in us to
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.160]   bring us to that place that God has designed us for. Now, I must not stay with these. Work
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.680]   them out for yourselves. All I am asking is this. Do you know something about this?
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:37.560]   And then, let us come to something a little more specific. Guidance. I put this under
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.640]   the general heading. I think it belongs there. The guidance of the companion. The guidance
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.840]   of the Holy Spirit. Now, what do you mean by guidance? Well, let me give it to you,
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.760]   as it were, at its maximum. Then we can see the kind of thing I am talking about, and
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:02.400]   we can then work it out for ourselves on a lower level. Listen to Acts 13, the first
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.680]   two verses. Now, there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:14.120]   as Barnabas and Simeon, that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manion, which had
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.960]   been brought up with Herod, the Tetrarch, and Saul. As they ministered to the Lord and
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:28.080]   fasted, the Holy Ghost said, "Separate unto me Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.960]   I have called them." There is one. Let us look at another in Acts 15, this time verse
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.040]   28. Here is the council at Jerusalem sending out a message, and they do not hesitate to
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:46.120]   say this, "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:54.400]   burden than these necessary things." It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:06.640]   Now then, what does all this mean? Well, this is, I say, a great example of the Spirit guiding
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:13.080]   and leading. How do you think he did that in those two instances? Well, there can be
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.920]   no question, it seems to me, that this was not a matter of an audible voice or anything
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:24.400]   like that. This is the way the Spirit does guide. He puts a pressure upon the mind and
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   upon the heart. He raises an idea and puts it in the centre of the mind, and then he
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:39.160]   arranges that circumstances should be such that everything is pointing in that direction.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:46.280]   That is how he does it, and I am asking, do we know anything about that? Are you aware
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:54.640]   of this pressure of the Spirit in your life? Looking back, can you see it? He does. The
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.720]   non-Christian is not guided like this. He is not aware that he was brought to that place
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:07.440]   and to that position. Now look at it in terms of a review of your past life. Look at yourself
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.240]   as you are this morning. What are you doing here? How have you ever come here? Why are
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:19.320]   you what you are and not something else that you might have been so well? What is it? Is
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:25.240]   it something you have decided? All I am asking is this. Are you not standing in amazement
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:31.560]   as you look at it all, and are you not saying to yourself, "This is God. I have been brought
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:38.280]   to this. He is leading and he is guiding." Yes, let me help that still further by putting
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.840]   it in the negative form, how he guides negatively as well as positively. We find that in the
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.960]   sixteenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Let me read to you verses
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:56.400]   six and seven. "Now when they had gone," that is to say, the apostle Paul and his companions,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.760]   and remember it is the apostle Paul we are dealing with here, "Now when they had gone
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:08.280]   throughout Phrygia, the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:16.960]   the word in Asia, after they had come to Mycenae, they assayed to go into Bithynia, but the
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:24.920]   Spirit suffered them not." Now that is most interesting, and to me most helpful and most
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:31.360]   valuable in this matter that is before us. Here the apostle Paul, obviously, as far as
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:38.480]   he as a man was concerned, was anxious to go and preach the word in Asia. And he had
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:45.760]   obviously decided to do so, and he was on the verge of doing so. The Holy Ghost forbade
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:52.880]   him to do so. The Spirit not only presses forward, he holds back sometimes. "Oh, I
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.440]   know of nothing, I know of nothing that is more wonderful in experience than the restraint
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.360]   of the Holy Ghost, the forbidding of the Holy Ghost." When a man with his mind and his
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.880]   reason and taking all the factors into consideration says, "Well, now this is the obvious thing
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.160]   to do, and he is going to do it," he is not allowed to do it. And he may not be allowed
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:21.760]   to do it in many ways. Here is one of them. "That when with your mind you seem to see
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:28.280]   the thing quite clearly and have taken your decision, there is something wrong here. Your
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:34.800]   heart is not convinced. Your heart is not happy. And what I am trying to say is that
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.360]   that is the Holy Spirit that is. And if you are a child of God, you will know it is the
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:46.720]   Holy Spirit, and you will dare not go against it. You will be afraid to go against it. You
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.160]   see, when God guides us, he makes us unanimous. When the Spirit is leading, it has got to
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.920]   be unanimous. But here there was some restraint. He may also manipulate the factors and the
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:02.320]   circumstances so that you cannot do the thing. The two work together. And then, you see,
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.160]   they thought that they would go and preach in Bithynia. They said to go, they made the
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:16.760]   effort. But the Spirit suffered them not. And he does not. I say that you are aware,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:22.260]   therefore, of this conflict, that intellectually you may be perfectly convinced about something,
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:29.200]   but your spirit is not. And that is the Holy Ghost. So, you see, he does it both positively
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.880]   and negatively. He puts his pressure upon the mind. He puts his pressure upon the Spirit,
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:43.360]   the feelings, as it were. And so, in this way, he leads us on or he restrains us. But
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.160]   the thing we are conscious of the whole time is this, that he is there, that the companion
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.040]   is with us, that we are enjoying the fellowship, the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the Holy
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:27:01.720]   Spirit, and that we are not living our lives independently. But he has got hold of us.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.640]   If we are lagging and slack and slow, he just puts that pressure on the shoulder and he
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:13.520]   braces us up and he pushes us on. Or if we are rushing ahead in self-confidence and in
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.920]   a carnal zeal, the hand comes and holds us back and stops us and asks us to think what
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:30.320]   we are doing. It is the same spirit who does both. And he only does it to the children,
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.160]   because he has been sent to the children. The world, said our Lord himself in his last
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.960]   sermon, the world does not know him and the world cannot receive him. It is only the children
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:50.040]   who know these things. Now, all I am asking is, are you aware of these things to any extent?
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:58.560]   Looking at your life, the past and the present, do you see this? Do you say, I am what I am
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.880]   by the grace of God? Which is another way of saying, I am what I am because I am led
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:09.560]   of the Spirit. He led me to conviction. He led me to conversion. He led me to belief.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:16.800]   He has been leading me ever since. Here I am at this moment. I am what I am because
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.400]   by the grace of God, the Spirit of God is in me and he is leading me and guiding me.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.480]   He is constraining me. I am not my own. I am not living an independent life. The life
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.680]   I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.000]   for me. Very well. There it is. I must not wait. I could, but I must go on. Let me come
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.600]   to the particular general heading. We have dealt with these general manifestations, broad
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:52.400]   heading. We now come to the particular manifestations of the leading and the constraint of the Spirit.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:29:02.760]   I come to the particular because I want to be still more helpful. I want to be still
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:11.040]   more practical. You may say to me, "Ah, that's all right, this general pressure and constraint."
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.360]   I want to be quite sure about this. Very well. Let me give you some details. What does the
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.920]   Spirit lead us to? What does the Spirit lead us to apart from great decisions in our life
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:27.000]   and things like that? There are other things he leads us to. Here is one of them. The Spirit
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:39.760]   of God always leads us to the Bible. It is his book and he always leads people to it.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:46.760]   He always urges them to go to it and he gives them a delight in it. Now, let me again be
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:58.840]   particular about this. If you don't enjoy the Bible at all, well then, I make free to
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:05.160]   suggest that you are not a child of God at all. Now, watch the extremes again. Watch
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:13.360]   the extremes. As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that he may grow
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:23.440]   thereby, the babe does like the milk. But remember, the child can be very wayward again.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:34.040]   The child would like to eat nothing but sweets. All right, the child knows food also. Don't
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:40.480]   pay too much attention to the judgment of the child. All I am asking is this. Have you
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.160]   got any taste for this? Do you get enjoyment out of this?
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:54.360]   Now, let's be still more particular. I am not asking primarily about intellectual enjoyment
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.520]   because you know it is possible to have an intellectual enjoyment even of the Bible.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:09.080]   I have known men who have had that. It has simply been their way of doing crossword puzzles.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:16.160]   You can use the Bible like that. The Bible is a wonderful book. There is no greater intellectual
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:22.120]   treat than reading and studying the Bible. And there are people who do that. They hop
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.080]   about and there they are with their concordances and they are working out and others get interested
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.000]   in figures and prophecy and things like that. My dear friends, that can be purely intellectual.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.080]   I am not talking about that. The unregenerate can do that. This may be the hobby they take
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:46.280]   up. I am talking about a spiritual enjoyment. What do you mean by a spiritual enjoyment,
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.200]   says someone? How can I test whether my enjoyment is intellectual or spiritual? Well, here is
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:32:01.040]   one of the best tests I know. What effect does your study of the Bible have upon you?
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   If it just puffs you up with pride because of your great knowledge and understanding,
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:15.680]   well, you had better examine yourself again. But if it humbles you, if it makes you doubt
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:21.480]   whether you are a Christian at all, well, then I say you have very good evidence that
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:27.200]   you are a child of God. In other words, when the Spirit leads us to the Bible and when
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.640]   the Spirit is illuminating the page and our minds at the same time as he does with the
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.160]   child, the first thing you are conscious of is that the Bible, after all, is speaking
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:43.360]   to you. When you read about the Pharisees, you are not reading about people who lived
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.320]   two thousand years ago. You feel you are reading about yourself. And when you read about some
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.960]   of these characters in the Old Testament, David and so on, you are not reading a history
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:58.640]   book. You are reading about yourself. You say, "That's me. It's all very well.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.600]   It looks terrible in David, but I've got that sort of thing in me." When the Bible
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:10.520]   speaks to you like that, you are a child of God. He never does that with a hypocrite.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.680]   He never does that with a man who has only an intellectual interest in it. If you feel,
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.200]   therefore, that the Bible is speaking to you about yourself, speaking to you directly,
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.720]   that it is not merely some general truth or the gathering of doctrines, but is a living
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:33.080]   word that is saying something to you, upbraiding you, condemning you, increasing your hunger
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.920]   and thirst and so on, well, then that is a living spiritual relationship that the Holy
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:44.520]   Spirit alone can produce. The tragedy of the other man is that he can read his Bible all
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:50.320]   his life and be the same at the end as he was at the beginning.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:56.440]   I am always afraid to say a thing like this, but there is an awful danger in these mechanical
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:03.320]   schemes of Bible study. You just rush through it. You have done your portion. My friend,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:09.520]   does the Bible speak to you every day? If it does not, I am inclined to suggest you
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:15.200]   to drop your schemes for a moment and just take a verse and begin to think about it and
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.800]   ask it, "What are you saying to me?" We are not just meant to rush through the Bible
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.160]   a given number of times in a year or however often you do it. The Bible is the word of
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.440]   God. It is the food of the soul. It is the Spirit's message to you. Make certain that
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.640]   it is speaking to you. If you are aware that it is, you can be quite sure that you are
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:41.720]   a child of God. Let us leave that and just look at another
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   aspect. The Holy Spirit always leads to prayer. It is a part of the work of the companion.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.840]   Look at our Lord himself. Here in the days of his flesh, the Spirit was not given by
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:05.400]   measure unto him. He had the Spirit in all his fullness. What is the great characteristic
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:14.040]   of his life? One of the great characteristics is his prayer life, the time he spent in prayer,
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:24.200]   though he was the Son of God. The Spirit always does this. The Spirit urges us to pray, moves
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:31.720]   us to pray. You read the lives and the biographies of the saints of God throughout the centuries
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:36.920]   and you will find that they always testify to this, that they suddenly felt a desire
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.760]   to pray. They did not know why. They may have been thinking about something quite different,
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.520]   and yet suddenly they are disturbed in the way I have described, and there is an urge
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:56.800]   to pray. Oh, let me put it at its very lowest. If you have got this feeling within you that
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:04.760]   you are not praying enough, and you want to pray more, and you want to be in more immediate
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:11.000]   contact with God, and you long to be able to speak to him almost as it were as with
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.960]   men face to face, that is the work of the Spirit on us. In other words, I am using this
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:27.680]   test. The more we grow in grace, the more spiritual we become, the more we enjoy prayer,
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:35.560]   the more we depend upon it, the more we realize what a privilege it is. But I say that any
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:45.120]   first beginnings of a true, a real desire are indicative in and of themselves, that
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.680]   we are the children of God and that we are being led by the Spirit.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.840]   But let me go on and take it a bit further. You notice that wonderful thing which Paul
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:37:01.960]   tells us there in that eighth chapter of Romans in verses 26 and 27. "Likewise the Spirit
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:08.840]   also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:15.560]   the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.480]   Then he tells us the value of this, "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:25.000]   the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.760]   will of God." But it's verse 26 that helps us from this particular angle. "The Spirit
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:38.680]   helpeth our infirmities." Now you see, this is children of God he's talking about.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.800]   Children of God have got infirmities. Don't let the devil make you think that you're
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.160]   not a child of God because you have infirmities. Don't let him make you think that you're
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.200]   not a child at all because you're not a full-grown, fully developed adult child. Not at all. The
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:58.040]   Spirit helpeth our infirmities. These New Testament Christians seem to be very weak
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.800]   Christians, hence the need of the Gospels, hence the need of the Epistles. It was to
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:08.520]   help them and to strengthen them, full of infirmities. Groaning under their trials,
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:15.040]   he says, "The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities. We know not what we should pray for as we
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:22.720]   ought. There are circumstances and conditions in which we are so perplexed. We don't know
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.040]   what to do nor what to say. Even on our knees before God, we feel helpless and we don't
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.440]   know what to ask him for." Writes, says the Apostle, "Just at that point, because
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:43.880]   you are a child of God, the Spirit takes charge of the situation and he begins to make intercessions
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.560]   for you." Well, what are they? Well, in a sense, you don't know. All you can do
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:57.760]   is you groan. "Maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.200]   But you see, this is again one of the most glorious things, I think, about the Christian
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:09.960]   life and one of the most wonderful tests as to whether we are children of God or not.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.520]   The little child is in terrible trouble. His little world has collapsed. Everything's
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:20.640]   gone wrong and he's breaking his heart. Suddenly, he rushes to his father and his
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:29.560]   mother and he's so overwrought with his troubles and with his grief and his pain and his sorrow,
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:38.320]   he can do nothing but sob and sigh. And he finds tremendous relief in doing so. He knows
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.400]   he is expressing to his father or his mother the depth of his agony and of his grief and
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.440]   of his problem and of his trouble. He's not using words he can't. He's simply sobbing
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:57.560]   and sighing and groaning. And the child of God knows something about this. He still can't
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:06.920]   formulate his prayer. But you know, sometimes he utters an "Ohh!" from the very depth
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:12.320]   of his being. And there's more meaning in that than all the words he's ever uttered
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:20.680]   in all his prayers. That "Ohh!" that sighs for God and longs for him and just rushes
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:27.800]   to him and abandons itself in his arms and just says, "Ohh!" This longing, as if to
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:33.280]   say, "You know all about me because you're my father. I can't tell you, but you know,"
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:42.200]   groaning, which cannot be uttered. And it's all right. "He that searcheth the hearts
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:50.080]   knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:56.160]   to the will of God." In other words, though you, as it were, intellectually are in a state
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.360]   of complete confusion, and you can't explain and you can't expound and you can't give
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:08.040]   your reasons, you're suddenly aware that everything is all right. You're speaking
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:16.600]   to God, though you can't express it. And you know that God is hearing you. And that's
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:23.920]   an absolute proof that you're a child of God. The child next door doesn't do that
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.800]   with you, a father or mother. Of course not. That's something that only the child does
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:37.400]   with father and mother. Nobody else. It belongs to this relationship.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:51.760]   And if you know what it is just to sigh and to sob and to long and express your longing,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:58.400]   I say that you're a child of God and the Spirit of God is in you. And that you have
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:06.800]   found more joy in the depth of your misery in an occasional oil than the whole world
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:12.840]   together has ever been able to give you. Well, we'll have to leave it, I'm afraid,
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:18.360]   at that for this morning. We've got other things to go on to under this heading of the
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.880]   particular. The next God willing that we'll go on to deal with next Sunday morning is
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:30.720]   the way he leads us and guides us and constrains us in the matter of our daily life and living.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:36.480]   But I've said enough and more than enough this morning to convince you whether you're
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:48.340]   a child of God or not. Any one of these things that you know to be true should give you certain
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:56.560]   absolute knowledge that you're a child of God. Hold on to that one thing. Go to him,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   thank him, praise his name, and just ask him to give you grace to love you more, to love
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:10.040]   him more, and he will hear you. Amen.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
