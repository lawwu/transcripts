[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.040]   i guess we made it to episode 22. your intro becomes one second longer for every episode we do
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.360]   it's just so people love it and people so laborious you know they don't they think it's so stupid i am
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.400]   you have to understand persuasion what i'm doing is i do the same intro and it works okay we're
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.880]   still we're still talking about the intro okay let's just see everybody's obsessed about it you
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.360]   proved my point all right guys are we gonna dress elephant in the room the elephant in the room or
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.760]   do we just move on to topics i will say elephant in the room after the last show um i fought very
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.800]   hard with the three of you to not post that episode you wanted to can't you want to spike
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.560]   the episode i wanted to spike the episode and i'll tell you why um i thought it was not good content
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.960]   i don't think vlad said anything new or remarkable or interesting i don't think we had good analysis
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   and i think the whole thing kind of felt flat and felt like a pr stunt and i felt that truly and
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.280]   honestly and i you know i made the case to you guys that we should cancel um obviously i lost
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.840]   uh and i think going forward we should have a veto right but you know we can talk about that offline
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.280]   did you quit the show or did you threaten to quit the show i threatened
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.000]   i'm gonna after this i'm gonna propose to you my rules my ground rules for for going forward
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.240]   one of which i think should be no more pr from jason's portfolio but um you know besides
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.360]   that i think i might be i think i hear a bestie guestie is that calm
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.320]   calm calm at the door
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:32.160]   and i i don't think that we're journalists by the way i don't i don't think that the journalism
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.400]   thing works for us i think we're like analysts and commentators and you know we have opinions
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.720]   and so to bring someone on and try and interview them with a four-on-one format it just feels weird
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.240]   it doesn't seem to work it doesn't create an opportunity for discourse and frankly you know
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.600]   um when you try and do journalism in this context you either appear like you're softballing or you
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.360]   appear like you're doing gotcha journalism
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.400]   and i think both are bad and so i think it works really well when the four of us just kind of chat
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.160]   and analyze and shoot the and have opinions and talk and debate um and so my vote is to
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   kind of avoid doing bestie guesties unless you know it's something pretty amazing and critical
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.160]   and we can all kind of build a dialogue with that person around a topic but um yeah so that's kind
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.280]   of my where i'm sitting and and how i feel about it but we've had a lot of debates obviously since
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.800]   since the last episode about it can i can i build on what you're saying
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.360]   um you know this is like kind of like that really uh famous teddy roosevelt quote about sort of like
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.640]   the man in the arena with the dust on his face right um i feel like all four of us are in the
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.720]   grind doing things and i think what makes the podcast good is it's almost like there's like
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.360]   you know in a basketball game of four quarters there's a time out and you come off the floor
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.960]   and you can actually just take a second to observe what you're seeing
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.640]   and then the ref blows the whistle and you go back into the game and i think
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.840]   for me what makes this thing so fun is i feel like every friday for these two hours you know
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.360]   it's basically the ref calls a timeout or the coach calls a timeout and we can just kind of
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.120]   take a breath and just observe all right what's happened before we get back in the arena and so
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.440]   you know just to your point um i don't think we're journalists and i don't think we should
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.360]   try to be because i don't think that's the point of what this is it should be four friends talking
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.960]   about things that are important and then to the extent that it's important and interesting for
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.440]   other people they'll listen or not listen to what you're saying and then you can just kind of go back
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   and do what you're saying and then you can just kind of go back and do what you're saying and then you
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   can just kind of go back and do what you're saying and then you can just kind of go back and do what you're saying
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.600]   and then you can just kind of go back and do what you're saying and then you can just kind of go back
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.920]   and do what you're saying and then you can just kind of go back and do what you're saying and then
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   they'll listen or not listen and i think these last few weeks we got caught up a little too much
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.680]   and you know ratings where is it ranking how can we go higher and it's that the gamification of
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.240]   people's reactions that i think caused us you know to do that um whereas the episode before
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.480]   i actually kind of liked because draymond is legitimately one of our really good friends
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.520]   you know we see him we see him we see him many many times obviously less during basketball
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.360]   season but a ton when he's outside we play poker together we all hang out together
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.880]   So that to me I think is sort of inbounds. Last week, I think we were all supposed to be on point,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.800]   I'll just tell you personally for me, I had an extremely crushing two weeks of work. I was
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.920]   extremely tired. I ended up literally unplugging and not doing anything for three days straight
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.600]   and sleeping. I didn't even do my best even just to be either supportive or argumentative with
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.840]   Vlad. So I don't think I got anything out of it myself. Okay, coming around the horn sacks,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.960]   how do you feel that episode stands on its own? Obviously, it's very polarizing. We got
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.200]   barbecued in the comments, we got barbecued on Reddit, we got barbecued on social media,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.880]   but then there were a large number of people who said they really liked it. My mom,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:45.360]   Robin Hood PR, my portfolio manager. I mean, there were people who liked it.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.040]   Sequoia, I thought it was excellent.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.920]   Right.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.440]   There's 12 people.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.700]   In the lunch.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.120]   But give us your candid assessment, because you weren't as hard as these other two on it.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.440]   Yeah, I wasn't as hard as these other two. And I do feel like that if they felt that we were soft
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.280]   on Vlad, then they should have brought it harder. And they should have gone after Vlad and challenged
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.720]   him more. That being said, I completely understand and agree with what Freiburg is saying that, look,
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.520]   we're not journalists, we're not playing a game of gotcha. It's not our job to go after Vlad,
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.020]   I think a lot of the comments on Twitter, that's what they wanted us to do. But that's not who we are.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.560]   You know,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.340]   It's difficult for business too, Sax. I mean, if you're attacking Vlad,
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.460]   and then the next day, we have to go into supporting founder mode. It's kind of a bad look,
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.840]   isn't it?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.380]   Yeah, I mean, it's not what we do, right? I mean, we are, like Jamal was saying, we are in the arena,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.900]   we're doing things, we're not critics sitting on the sidelines, pointing out, you know, what the
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.500]   doers have done. You know, we're not critics, we're not critics, we're not critics, we're not
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.940]   deeds did wrong, you know, and so it's not our job to run an
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.960]   Inquisition on on Vlad, you know, and so we're not really
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.800]   equipped to do that. I think I think freeburg is right that it
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.100]   doesn't really make sense to have guests on the show if the
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.780]   job is to, you know, to get to the bottom of something as
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.460]   investigators, you know, we're not we're not investigators.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.160]   It was, you know, a big story, just to sort of put a cap in it
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.480]   from my perspective. You know, I'm always supportive of my
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.420]   guys, I try to be supportive of whoever I invest in, and I try
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.440]   to give them the benefit of the doubt. And this is a situation
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.380]   where, you know, people are upset, there were mistakes that
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.520]   were made. And so I think anything other than demolishing
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.820]   Vlad is considered by some constituency as a failure,
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.240]   right? And so what are we supposed to do here? I can't be
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.240]   trashing my own company that I'm an investor in and a supporter
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.420]   of and founders who I believe in it just would.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.140]   Well, I think there was a moment, there was a moment
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.060]   in the pod, Jason, where I think actually, so on the whole, I
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.880]   thought Vlad did it did a good job in accomplishing his
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.200]   objective on our pod, which was the same objective he had in
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.580]   front of Congress, which was basically to run out the clock
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.720]   without saying very much, you know, and, you know, he
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.480]   actually, whoever prepped him for Congress did a pretty good
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.200]   job, because he testified for five hours, and said nothing
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.800]   quotable, you know, which which is pretty much kind of the goal
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.580]   in that situation. It's kind of the goal for your head down.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.960]   Yeah, exactly. So but there was a moment in the pod last week
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.300]   where I think Vlad got himself in a little bit of trouble.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.240]   Freeberg did ask actually a pretty tough question about the
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.060]   guy in the street who who had lost all of his life savings.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.420]   How would Vlad respond to that? He made this claim? Well, I saved
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.300]   that person money because I shut down trading at the high. And
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.860]   then we pointed out No, I mean, it was a high because you shut
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.640]   down trading, you have the causation backwards. And then
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.220]   you you ran and said, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you know,
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.200]   you're not going to get paid for this. And then you're like,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.320]   well, my guy was on the floor, I gotta pick him up. What are you
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.420]   talking about? I call the timeout. I got in there. But
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.240]   let's Yeah, exactly. Yeah. All right, let's move on. Let's do
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.860]   we talk about the insanely high profile guest that was planned
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.040]   for March 5, that just canceled on? No, we should we should
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.620]   talk to we put it on the table. Because I you know, this is the
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.620]   other thing about protocol, just say Freeberg is, if we have a
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.280]   guest on, you cannot just spike the guest if they took the time
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.080]   to be on that was my unless you tell them before they come on, I
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.640]   think it doesn't code if we don't like it. Yeah, I think they
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.980]   get that right. None of us do this for a profession. None of us
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.200]   are getting paid. We don't have any advertisers like, I
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.380]   completely agree. We're not here to get a PR machine for people.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.380]   I mean, Vlad had his friggin PR woman sitting on the zoom call
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.860]   while we were doing it last week. You know, I like I just don't
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.960]   think that's a little inside baseball that got interesting. I
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.940]   think explain what happened when Well, no, we don't have to go
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.360]   there, Jason. I just think I just think what Freeberg says is
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.400]   right. Like, we we do this, we don't make any money from it. We
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.060]   do it because we like it.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.420]   We like to talk we I think we all learn from it. I think other
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.820]   folks enjoy it. They learn from it. But I do think that
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.640]   Freeberg's right. We're not going to be used as a show. I
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   think we're learning as this goes. I think we're learning
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.180]   what the ground rules should be just like any other business.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.160]   Vlad's made mistakes, he's going to change. We've made some
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.300]   mistakes and we're iterating and I think one positive iteration
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   that Freeberg has proposed is if any one of us don't like an
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.800]   episode because we think it's basically moving away from our
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.380]   values, we should be able to spike it and I support that.
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.880]   I support it.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.500]   Generally, but I don't like the idea of inviting a guest on and
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.460]   then it doesn't go well. And then telling, you know, from our
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.700]   perspective, it makes us look bad. And then we tell the
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.280]   guests, well, you came out good, and we came out down, therefore
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.820]   we're killing.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.160]   No, no, I don't think that's the point. I think what Freeberg
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.820]   says is like, look, this is not for to be a marketing thing. And
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.980]   so we're going to ask things that are exposed that are about
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.980]   having a real conversation, where there's real honesty. And
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.960]   if you're going to just be there and bat around as SAC said to
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.980]   run the clock out,
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.400]   then we're just going to spike.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   Fair enough. Fair enough. I think that's communicated ahead.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:51.780]   I'm okay.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.640]   By the way, come with your a game. And this is a great segue
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.820]   to talk about what actually we were a person that was going to
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.760]   come on and realize that they probably were going to get so
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.460]   pilloried that they basically spike themselves is yeah, they
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.220]   opted out Chesa Boudin, the district attorney of San
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.620]   Francisco. Tell tell the guys what happened sex.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.140]   Well, no, we invited him to come on the podcast.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.940]   No, no, we didn't invite him to come. He
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.220]   was an intermediary said that she could get him on the pod. Would we like to have him on the pod?
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.080]   We said, we discussed it. We said, sure, have Chesa Boudin on and then go from there. Sex. We
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.200]   didn't like seek him out. He was well, okay. So he he great. So he but he agreed to be on the show.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.660]   And then you are scheduler got an email out of the blue, like a day or two ago saying, sorry,
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.500]   he's not coming on the show. No explanation. Right? And that what happened?
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.760]   Yeah, that's basically it.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.980]   I mean, so look, here's what I would say is, um,
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.760]   Chesa, Mr. District Attorney, you don't have to come on the show,
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:58.440]   but I will challenge you to a debate. Anytime, any place, any format on your policies in San Francisco.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:06.360]   So if you have, if you have the huevos to engage in a debate, I am ready.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.160]   And I thought Chesa was a guy who had a little bit of courage. I mean, there was that night when
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.260]   people were discussing the situation in San Francisco and on clubhouse and he jumped into the
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:16.960]   room. So he was like, I'm going to go to the clubhouse. I'm going to go to the clubhouse. I'm
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.180]   going to go to the clubhouse. I'm going to go to the clubhouse. So I thought this was a guy who had
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.400]   some cojones. So Chesa, if you have, if you have the chutzpah, if you have the cojones,
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.600]   if you have the huevos, let's debate, let's talk about your policies. And by the way,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.960]   he's an expert. This is what he does. You know, for a living. Isn't he a defense attorney,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.260]   Sachs? You're going to have a, he was a public defender. He should,
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.940]   he should mop the floor with me. I'm just some shallow tech bro. Yeah. Tech bro.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.920]   Tech bro. Who doesn't know anything who he can easily demonize. So I would say, come on,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.140]   let's go. Let's do a debate. I'll agree to whatever format you want, but we need to talk
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.880]   about what's happening in San Francisco because crime is out of control and it's his fault.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.820]   Trigger the young Spielberg Rain Man song right about.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.560]   Here we go. Drop it. Boom.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.480]   Baby I'm the rain man.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.940]   With me cackling in my mind.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:16.920]   Should we talk about it? Let's talk about it. We should talk about what's happening in San
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.680]   Francisco. Okay. So since, since the last pod there, there has been another victim.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:30.840]   Sheria Mas, Mas Yoka, who was a young, young man from, from originally from Kenya, who he came to
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:37.500]   the United States for college, just like Hannah Abay who was killed on New Year's Eve. He went
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.640]   to Dartmouth. All of his advisors said he was brilliant. He had a young wife and a three-year
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.900]   old baby. He was in San Francisco for 10 days, goes out running and gets.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:54.940]   Hit gets, gets killed by another drugged out hit and run driver who had been named let's
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:00.940]   say, I think it was Jerry, Jerry Oli Adams or something like that. I don't have the,
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:06.800]   the guy's name, but he was arrested four or five times in the last year. And he was released
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.100]   every single time by Buden's office. It's, it's just like the New Year's Eve story where
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.880]   you had this repeat offender, Troy McAllister hit, you know, his wife, his wife, his wife,
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.620]   you know, he was, he had stolen a, a car. He was fleeing another crime he had committed. He was
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:28.100]   on drugs and he killed Hannah Abay and Elizabeth Platt. And this was, this was another case where
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.140]   he was caught five times over the past year. And every single time he was not charged by
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.640]   boot and he was just let go. And so we have this case, we have a, a district attorney who
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.440]   doesn't wanna prosecute people. His agenda is decarceration. It's like a fire chief who
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.320]   doesn't believe in using water. Yes. And, and.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.860]   Bur he, he is part of the.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.900]   all down party yeah let me challenge you with the argument he might make which i think i've
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:58.700]   heard him make a few times um which is really um a position on the criminal justice system
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:07.020]   not necessarily on local prosecution but really what he says is once um you know once someone
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.740]   ends up in the criminal justice system in the united states it causes this cycle of
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.540]   recurrence and the cycle of repeat that is very difficult to get out it basically minimizes the
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:22.620]   opportunity for reform uh for an individual for a criminal to reform themselves and to have a shot
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:29.500]   at being a successful member of society again in the future and the objective is find other ways to
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:35.100]   to kind of accelerate reform and not use incarceration as the only tool in the toolbox
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.620]   what is um you know what is the the argument back to him when he makes that point because i've heard
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.860]   him make that point a number of times and how do you kind of move past that uh that point with him
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.220]   yeah so so
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:52.140]   i'm not saying that incarceration is the only answer but buden's only answer is decarceration
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.940]   he doesn't want to prosecute anyone he doesn't want to lock anybody up and we see the results
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:02.620]   immediately in this community you have these repeat offenders now killing people they should
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:09.580]   have been locked up um it's you know buden's always putting forth these elaborate theories
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.900]   this is you know the the central chronicle an article about it about why these crimes are
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.900]   occurring and why they're happening and so i think that's a really important point and i'm going to
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.900]   occur and he never wants to put the fault on the people who are actually perpetrating the crimes
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:25.260]   as always economic desperation he just put it forward a theory that a decline in tourism
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:31.340]   is causing uh people to commit more uh home invasions you know he he never wants yes this
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.100]   was in the service school chronicle article here i'll put it up on the screen i mean the other
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.460]   thing you left out david i'll say is and this was really you know hits home to anybody with kids
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:47.500]   is a food driver for doordash not that it matters which service but was in san francisco's pacific
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:53.900]   heights neighborhood which is the safest and most elite neighborhood uh in it's you know the beverly
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:17:01.180]   hills or bel air of san francisco um and his car was carjacked with his four-year-old daughter and
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.900]   two-year-old boy inside now of course you should not be leaving two kids in the car putting that
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.700]   aside that mistake which i'm sure this father is suffering over but
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.380]   he's not going to be able to get out of the car and he's not going to be able to get out of the car
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.980]   but he needed to make deliveries obviously he made a mistake leaving the kids in the car
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:22.780]   but the we all got an amber alert last week on our phones i mean this is the law level of lawlessness
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:29.900]   it's turned into escape from new york level gotham city level chaos and the criminals know
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:35.340]   they will not be prosecuted and this is the key criminal justice problem here if you say
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:40.700]   you are not going to prosecute crime and you demonstrate to the hardest core faction of
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.300]   the criminal justice system that you are not going to prosecute they're going to take advantage of
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.180]   that weakness and and that's what's happening let me take the counterpoint just for a second
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.660]   just so we can construct what the other side of the argument looks like the other side of the
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.660]   argument says okay these folks are largely you know engaged in an enormous amount of petty crime
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:05.180]   to support their drug habit right i think that's probably the and that you know underneath that
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.940]   is just an explosion uh of opioids and fentanyl and whatnot
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   underneath that is sort of economic and social violence and i think that's probably the most important thing
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   that's happening right now is that you know the drug habit is going to be a huge problem for the people
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.220]   that is sort of economic uncertainty that's been compounding and just basically cresting over
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:21.500]   um and so folks would say okay these guys are a victim of a much broader economic malaise that
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.620]   needs to get fixed i'm just i'm just you know you're shaking your head jason but i'm just saying
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.540]   i think that that's where the trail of breadcrumbs grows in the counter in the counter in the in the
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:35.580]   counter argument so well these are these are the types of arguments that jason makes in order to
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.940]   um obfuscate and disguise that
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.820]   his real agenda is basically radical
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:41.820]   his real agenda is basically radical
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.060]   his real agenda is basically radical decarceration you know he's got this this
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:44.060]   decarceration you know he's got this this
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.540]   decarceration you know he's got this this childhood background where his parents
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   childhood background where his parents
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.540]   childhood background where his parents went to jail when he was just a baby and
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:48.540]   went to jail when he was just a baby and
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.700]   went to jail when he was just a baby and he grew up he says his earliest memories
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:50.700]   he grew up he says his earliest memories
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.620]   he grew up he says his earliest memories are visiting his parents in jail and it
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:52.620]   are visiting his parents in jail and it
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.020]   are visiting his parents in jail and it profoundly affected his political views
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.020]   profoundly affected his political views
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.780]   profoundly affected his political views and now we have to suffer through this
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:56.780]   and now we have to suffer through this
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.340]   and now we have to suffer through this we're suffering for his childhood trauma
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:18:59.340]   we're suffering for his childhood trauma
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.500]   we're suffering for his childhood trauma here's his childhood trauma and so so
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:01.500]   here's his childhood trauma and so so
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.980]   here's his childhood trauma and so so tramath you're right about deeper causes
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:03.980]   tramath you're right about deeper causes
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.260]   tramath you're right about deeper causes but it doesn't
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:05.260]   but it doesn't
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.660]   but it doesn't excuse the need to
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:07.660]   excuse the need to
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.260]   excuse the need to lock people up when they are dangerous
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:09.260]   lock people up when they are dangerous
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.740]   lock people up when they are dangerous to the community and it's not just petty
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:11.740]   to the community and it's not just petty
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.420]   to the community and it's not just petty crime i mean let's go through that the
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:13.420]   crime i mean let's go through that the
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.380]   crime i mean let's go through that the actions he's taken as da okay so first
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:16.400]   actions he's taken as da okay so first

[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:32.960]   locked up what chase has said is that he
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.900]   locked up what chase has said is that he would replace cash bail with an algorithm
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:35.920]   would replace cash bail with an algorithm
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.060]   would replace cash bail with an algorithm well what exactly is that algorithm he
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.080]   well what exactly is that algorithm he
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.140]   well what exactly is that algorithm he won't explain well he won't submit to
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.160]   won't explain well he won't submit to
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.140]   won't explain well he won't submit to third party audit there is no algorithm
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:42.160]   third party audit there is no algorithm
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.700]   third party audit there is no algorithm they're just letting people go okay then
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:44.720]   they're just letting people go okay then
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.860]   they're just letting people go okay then the next thing he did was fire seven
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:46.880]   the next thing he did was fire seven
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.060]   the next thing he did was fire seven veteran prosecutors in the da's office
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:50.080]   veteran prosecutors in the da's office
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.740]   veteran prosecutors in the da's office who weren't on board with his agenda
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:51.760]   who weren't on board with his agenda
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.740]   who weren't on board with his agenda these are people who have spent their
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:53.760]   these are people who have spent their
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.020]   these are people who have spent their whole lives prosecuting murders rapes i
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.040]   whole lives prosecuting murders rapes i
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.420]   whole lives prosecuting murders rapes i mean hardcore crime and it takes years
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:19:59.440]   mean hardcore crime and it takes years
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.500]   mean hardcore crime and it takes years of experience to learn how to be a
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:01.520]   of experience to learn how to be a
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.140]   of experience to learn how to be a prosecutor like that so for him to just
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.160]   prosecutor like that so for him to just
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.540]   prosecutor like that so for him to just purge this office of these veteran
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:06.560]   purge this office of these veteran
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.100]   purge this office of these veteran prosecutors is a disaster for the city
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.120]   prosecutors is a disaster for the city
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.180]   prosecutors is a disaster for the city i've been talking to people
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.200]   i've been talking to people
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.780]   i've been talking to people who used to work in the da's office and
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:12.800]   who used to work in the da's office and
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.620]   who used to work in the da's office and they tell me that the problem goes much
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:14.640]   they tell me that the problem goes much
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.220]   they tell me that the problem goes much deeper than that that in addition to
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:16.240]   deeper than that that in addition to
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.100]   deeper than that that in addition to these seven veterans he purged
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.120]   these seven veterans he purged
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.180]   these seven veterans he purged over 30 prosecutors which is about a
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.200]   over 30 prosecutors which is about a
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.260]   over 30 prosecutors which is about a quarter of the whole office have left
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:23.280]   quarter of the whole office have left
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.940]   quarter of the whole office have left under his reign because they don't like
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:24.960]   under his reign because they don't like
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.260]   under his reign because they don't like working for him so you know and he
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:27.280]   working for him so you know and he
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.260]   working for him so you know and he complains about being short-staffed he
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.020]   says a lot that he can't you know prosecute everyone he needs to prostitute he's so short
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.860]   staffed the reason he's short staff is no one wants to work for him you know by the way i think
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.060]   it's worth highlighting this guy was elected right so the the the city uh the voters in the city
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:47.260]   in a runoff i understand right he won by something like 2 000 votes it was a tiny tiny number of
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:53.180]   votes regardless people voted him in on a platform that he very clearly articulated and is now
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.300]   realizing in office so there was something about that platform that i think is worth noting
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:05.500]   was and is appealing uh and and probably is to a large number of people large differences right and
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.580]   no the the the part of it that's appealing okay is that is that is that we we do believe that there
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.420]   are too many people in prison and that a better and a better way to deal with a drug addict who
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.980]   commits say petty theft is to send them to treatment okay as opposed to putting them
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.340]   in prison right so i think we can all agree on that but but his agenda is so much more radical
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.340]   than that he just doesn't want to lock people up take um take troy mcallister okay this is a
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:40.540]   dangerous person who uh he was uh he was facing trial for his third strike okay he committed
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:47.180]   armed robbery he robbed a store with a gun okay he was facing a third strike for that for that
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:52.300]   robbery and one of the first things uh chase did when he came in was basically uh release him for
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.620]   time served he basically pleaded that down that was someone who's facing a life sentence that is
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.900]   the reason why hannah abe and elizabeth platt are dead is because he didn't want to prosecute that's
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:07.740]   a violent offender i'm not disagreeing by the way i think like what is interesting to me is that so
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:14.940]   many people um have an eye on and agree with the notion that criminal justice system needs reform
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:20.940]   the problem is realizing that reform with a radical district attorney doesn't really
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.380]   resolve to a solution it resolves to more problems on a local level here's what's good and even chase
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.860]   has said this publicly which is like you can't just solve this problem from the da's office it
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.580]   is a much bigger and broader problem and the radical action he's taking isn't solving any
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.500]   problems it's creating far more and um i think it is worth noting though that there is should and
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:49.100]   likely will be especially with kamala harris uh um as vice president some attempts at reforming on a
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.660]   federal level um uh you know how how criminals are treated how the system um realizes opportunities
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:01.420]   for them to reform and come back into society as productive members but to your point you lose all
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.980]   sense of safety and security if you try and do it solely on the local level well let me let me ask a
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:11.740]   question like look now we have basically political activism and judicial activism on not just the
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.220]   right right people used to pillory trump for putting in all these you know extremely
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.180]   conservative judges who felt they were going to just sort of like legislate their own point of view
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.940]   um you know supreme court nominees who were going to try to overturn roe v wade
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.380]   uh but it turns out it's happening on the left as well i guess just more at the local level
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:35.020]   um how pervasive is this like meaning the issues of san francisco are these are these the same
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:42.300]   issues of other cities and towns in america well i mean you've got gascon in l.a who's
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:49.500]   running the exact same agenda as chase abudin he's not prosecuting third strikes he was just
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:55.180]   sued by an organization of deputy da's and the judge is now requiring him to uphold the law
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.300]   which is three strikes he will not bring third strike charges on his own he's also this is both
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:06.540]   gascon and buddha now have prohibited prosecutors from attending the parole hearings of dangerous
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:12.380]   convicts murderers rapists whatever and victims groups are up in arms because they need a
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.780]   prosecutor to go there and explain to the parole board why this person does not deserve to be
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:22.780]   released and so you now have recall movements forming by the way they've also done stuff like
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.940]   take death penalty off the table they've take taken action
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:30.380]   taking gang enhancements off the table they're like voluntarily they're unilaterally disarming
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.100]   their their their prosecution teams they're taking away weapons at their disposal to lock
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.380]   people up and this is why you're already seeing recalls forming around gascon in l.a there's now
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.860]   a recall of uh buddh informing okay david david go back to what freeburg just said
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.980]   they're probably not doing a bait and switch on their platform so let's just like
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.700]   what do you think it is about what they are saying that resonates
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.140]   with the plurality of people yeah here's the thing that resonates um and it's not that
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:05.740]   again it goes back to this idea that incarceration is definitely not the only answer this is where i
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:11.980]   agree the problem is budin is on the other side of it where decarceration is his only answer right
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:18.620]   we need to use uh multiple weapons or tools in our toolkit here so so hold on so for example okay
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:24.460]   let's take the let's take the drug addict who commits a petty theft we all agree that the drug
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.180]   addict is a criminal and we all agree that person should go to treatment not to jail or prison right
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.580]   a non-violent of course offender okay reason but how are you how are you going to get that person
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.060]   to go to treatment because right now there is no leverage whatsoever to get that person to go to
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:44.060]   treatment because buddhism's not bringing charges he's not prosecuting the choice should be given
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.460]   to that person listen you can either go to jail or you can go to treatment yeah what's it going to be
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:54.140]   now we have all these social services guess what nobody uses them because a hardcore addict is not
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:59.500]   going to avail themselves of those services i would make the argument that we have a broader
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.300]   bigger problem with the criminal justice system as it operates and it is deep and it is complex
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.500]   and it is friggin awful there's a book from a few years ago that this guy named shane bauer wrote
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.180]   i'm just trying to remember the name i think it's called american prison
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.220]   and uh the guy goes undercover and he goes and works in a in a in a in a penitentiary
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.540]   in louisiana um and he reports on what the conditions are like and these are these these
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.980]   prisons that are run by private companies that are contracted by the state locally
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.540]   and what it's like to be an employee at one of these companies and what these employees do
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:36.060]   and how the prisoners are treated there is no system for reform once you end up behind bars
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.260]   in most prisons in the united states and that is um you know he makes the argument others have
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.900]   made the argument that is a uh has a long history that dates all the way back to slavery in the
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.980]   united states and in some cases it's just about ineptitude
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.940]   and in some cases about unions especially in california where we have a huge cost for
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.580]   for corrections and for the uh the health care and the pensions for corrections officers
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.620]   um and so there's a lot of complex competing interests in history that relates to why this
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:09.180]   criminal justice system doesn't largely work on a moral and ethical basis as we might all kind of
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.500]   you know wear our hearts and look at like at how things are working and so the problem is
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.180]   everyone sees this or a lot of people will see this voters will see this system
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:23.660]   treating people poorly being inept being corrupt and they want to be racist and they want to fix it
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.580]   and the way they fix it is they see a guy who shows up and he's like i'm a sledgehammer
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.580]   and i'm going to fix it i'm going to take care of all these people and the reality is when you try
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.300]   and take a shotgun and shoot it inside of a room it's going to cause more problems than good and i
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:41.740]   think that's really what he is he is a manifestation of the anger of voters and the anger of people
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:47.500]   that look at how complex and racist the system is and how difficult it is to resolve these problems
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.420]   and we're all looking for a simple big hammer answer and he's got the biggest mouth around
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.540]   and the biggest hammer and that's why people vote for him all right and then we'll wrap it up absent
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.340]   a few uh words specifically racist if you took that out you could use that entire statement you
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:07.420]   said and describe trump as well meaning the left and the right are moving to these polls
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.060]   where it's all about authoritarian sort of strongmen
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.260]   at the federal state local level folks to your point david that just want to go and take a sledge
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:22.940]   hammer to things and depending on your political beliefs or depending on the biases or depending on
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:28.380]   your life lived you're going to gravitate to these two poles and what's crazy is over the
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:37.100]   next 20 or 30 years these polarizing figures will become crisper sharper smarter you know
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:43.100]   they'll find a way to foment all of all of the support without any of the long tail
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.020]   shittiness that trump figured out like trump was you know he's like a beta test of an
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:54.620]   idea right he was like version 0.1 wait till we see version 1.0 of the american strongman or strong
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:59.740]   woman it's really going to be scary well yeah and this is this is a guy who um
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:05.660]   was a fan of of hugo chavez long after he revealed himself to be a strongman
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:12.140]   intent on ruling for life and so yeah he is very much in that mold he is a sledgehammer
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.780]   to the system but but look i think and and the problems are big and complicated
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:22.220]   but look we all have a role to play the reformers have a role to play public defenders and defense
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.700]   attorneys have a role to play and the district attorneys and prosecutors have a role to play
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.260]   and the problem we have right now and the role of the district attorney is to prosecute i don't
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:37.100]   think that this by the way sax is a very difficult problem to solve i think there are just so many
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:43.980]   misaligned incentives it's very clear that we don't try to reform people when they go to prison
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.540]   and that there's a weird incentive when it's a for-profit or a for-profit or a for-profit or a
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.780]   for-profit prison and the customers and the revenue is based on how many people you have in
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:56.700]   the prison so if we just get rid of that there's no private prisons where people have an incentive
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:01.740]   to keep people in there and then if we made treatment free for everybody and had over
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.540]   capacity of treatment centers and then we look at the drug schedule and say these are the drugs
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.220]   that are not co these are the drugs that are not harmful and these are the drugs that are
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:16.300]   really really really harmful we're looking at a fentanyl issue like it's a
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:23.740]   cannabis issue and that that's drugs you know cannabis versus fentanyl is like a nuclear bomb
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:30.380]   versus like a slingshot there's no comparison between these two things right and but here's
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:35.260]   the thing no one's going to treatment when they're not forced well of course right but there's no
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:40.060]   treatment to go to maybe the wait for treatment is six no no that's not true that's not true
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.740]   in a lot that's not true we we have a lot of social services that aren't being used there
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.060]   are there is a lot of treatment available people don't want to go to the drug store and they're
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.060]   not going to be able to get treatment unless they really want to go to the drug store and they don't
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.060]   want to do it unless they really have to let me bring it back to where we were before maybe the
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:56.940]   right thing is to actually have a bunch of these sledgehammer folks go off for the next 10 or 20
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.020]   years you know the trumps and the chess of buddhins maybe they're all the same and maybe
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:06.460]   what we're all just saying is enough's enough this system doesn't work so let's just tear it down
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.540]   every single brick of it brick by brick at the local state and federal levels
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.820]   all i'm saying is um just i just want to get your reaction to that statement guys maybe maybe that's
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.860]   what people are that that is what budin is doing is he is deconstructing the district attorney's
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.420]   office from the inside he is destroying it he is not bringing charges against people
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.060]   he's driving away all the veteran prosecutors but two he's bringing in he's bringing in all
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.020]   his he's bringing in his own people who all were public defenders and have that mindset
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.380]   and people are dying look we can see the results right now in the streets innocent people are
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:45.580]   dying hannah abe elizabeth platt sharia it's an emergency but to chamath's point is there any
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:51.740]   validity sacks or friedberg to the burn it all down cause chaos and then people come in and say
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.980]   you know what that's not gonna this needs to be fixed let's have a new one discussion will nuance
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.540]   be added to this discussion sacks we need to improve things incrementally okay you're not
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.260]   going to make things better by dismantling the whole district attorney's office i mean come on
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.340]   we need to improve things incrementally yeah i mean look everything looks exponential until
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:15.340]   it cycles back so you know you're only going to have so much um evolution to gotham
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.700]   in san francisco until enough people put their hands in the air and say okay you know time for
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.660]   a change let's go back and let's start fixing this they are they are saying that that's why
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:30.060]   we're having that i mean there's a recall chesa boone movement flexing a muscle and making it
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.860]   stronger i think you know we're learning a lot about what approaches to criminal justice reform
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:40.300]   work and what approaches do not work and it is clear that a local only non-prosecution position
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:45.100]   is not going to work with respect to both criminal justice reform and the satisfaction of the society
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.260]   at large um and we're realizing that and i think we we are inevitably i mean there's so many people
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.180]   that are up in arms we are inevitably going to cycle back the other way at some point very soon
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:58.540]   here yeah and honestly i think you guys are over intellectualizing this a little bit you know when
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:05.500]   when sharia uh died because he got hit by by that repeat offender they asked his uh wife
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:12.940]   who's responsible for this she said very clearly the d.a that is who's responsible and she's right
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.860]   let's stop over intellectualizing this i know that's a good thing but i think it's a good thing
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.580]   to do and i think it's a good thing to do and i think it's a good thing to do and i think it's a
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.220]   good thing to do and i think it's a good thing to do and i think it's a good thing to do and i think
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.340]   it's a good thing to do and i think it's a good thing to do and i think it's a good thing to do
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:23.660]   frankly people like chesa pray on that because they can kind of obscure what they're doing
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:29.740]   with you know some nice sounding obfuscations nice sounding words but the reality is he's not
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:35.660]   prosecuting the way he needs to we got to stop this yeah and it is possible to have nuance
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.260]   and to hold multiple ideas in your head at the same time david you could there's a practical
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:44.620]   reality too people cannot murder people people cannot drive in cars and run around the streets
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:50.380]   red lights on fentanyl while saying the criminal justice system is incredibly biased and racist and
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:56.060]   people who are of color in texas you know wind up in jail for five or ten years for selling a bag of
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:02.300]   weed and then we're investing in companies that are making weed gummies or people are buying stock
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:08.860]   in weed companies at the same time you can't have one person who's a black teenager in texas going
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:14.380]   to jail for decades for doing what somebody in california or seattle or canada is getting an ipo
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:19.260]   for i mean this is a fundamental injustice in the world and you're right that's something that chesa
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.460]   prays on but there must be nuance here where we look at each individual situation say what are
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:30.300]   the ways to solve the problem surgically not with a shotgun to david freeburg's point but with maybe
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.260]   a scalpel and a and a sniper rifle do we want to move on to questions from our audience because
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.700]   they submitted hundreds of questions or do we want to move on to the australian news
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.420]   and facebook backing out of publishing news if that's a good thing or a bad thing let's end with
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.320]   the q a i think you're going to have to do that i think you're going to have to do that i think you're
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.260]   going to have to do that i think you're going to have to do that i think you're going to have to do that sacks what the is going on with
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.580]   sacks what the is going on with facebook and australia and climate change and this is
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.380]   facebook and australia and climate change and this is insanity yeah so i think what's going on in
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.660]   insanity yeah so i think what's going on in australia is is contemplating a law that would
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.100]   australia is is contemplating a law that would require facebook and google and i think just those
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.580]   require facebook and google and i think just those two companies to essentially pay royalties for
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:09.300]   hyperlinks to to to news publications and i think this is mostly at the behest of some powerful
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:15.380]   uh newspaper magnates down there i think like rupert murdoch and i love the way you say magnates
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:22.980]   well they are i mean you know um and so uh it but but this issue is going to be very closely watched
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:30.100]   by europe and maybe even the us um it's basically a tran like a a wealth transfer from google and
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:38.020]   and facebook to the traditional media and to traditional publishers um this is an issue where
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.900]   i actually
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:44.660]   i actually um side with with zuckerberg and facebook on this i mean i kind of throw up a
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:51.220]   little bit in my mouth saying that but um uh but uh no but look tim berners-lee has come out and said
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:57.700]   that it could really interfere with the open internet and the worldwide web if you start to tax
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:07.940]   hyperlinks i mean historically hyperlinks and the titles on hyperlinks were um were were fair use you
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.980]   could you could use those things without violating somebody else's copyright or need to pay them a
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:18.580]   royalty and so i think that it's it's bizarre to me that that facebook and google wouldn't now be
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:25.140]   able to use hyperlinks and i'm kind of worried about where that goes and uh you know well facebook
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.020]   facebook said that they're not going to publish links now for australian news and then but then
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:37.060]   they followed that up with they were also going to start uh dismantling any anti-climate change
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.180]   content i don't know if that's just just in australia well there's labeling so there's
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:45.460]   another thing going on which is they've decided now to label any posts involving climate change
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.860]   which is part of the whole censorship debate and um and so yeah i mean
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:55.060]   well it's separate but related in the sense that the traditional media is cheering on
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.380]   censorship but then when facebook essentially uh censors these links because they don't want to
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.940]   pay royalties to traditional media then the traditional media is up in arms and so they're
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:11.940]   very selective in how they how they view these issues my principle is very consistent which is
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:17.540]   i want an open internet i'm against censorship in all of its forms and i and i you know and
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:24.340]   i'm worried that this new australian law could really lead to some lead to an overall reduction
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:24.900]   or shutdown
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:30.820]   here's what's really i think going on is that with fair use the doctrine of fair use it's a
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:35.140]   four-part test uh you're a lawyer obviously you know all this sax but to sort of educate people
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:42.020]   in the audience who don't there's no specific uh number of characters no specific percentage of the
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:48.740]   original work that you uh can use you to clear yourself of fair use fair use is a test when it
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.460]   goes before a judge a judge looks at this four-part test the percentage of the work you used is the
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:53.620]   public confused you're not going to be able to get a fair use of the original work you're going to be
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:53.620]   able to get a fair use of the original work you're going to be able to get a fair use of the original
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:53.620]   work you're going to be able to get a fair use of the original work you're going to be able to get a fair
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.520]   public confused? Is there some educational or criticism version
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.800]   of it? So if you were to use 10% of this podcast, and you were to
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.440]   wrap it with, you know, put us in a picture window, and you
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.500]   were 50% of it, there was no confusion that you were
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.700]   commenting on this, that would be fair use. Or if you were to
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.720]   use it in educational system, and if you were monetizing it.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.560]   Now, if you were to just clip our pockets, like this one
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.740]   website, clip the podcast that made 60 clips of it took our
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.360]   file and I sent them a cease and desist action said, Hey, don't
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.400]   do this. We're doing it ourselves. They fought us. They
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   said, we're fans. And I said, I don't care if your fans are not,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.380]   you're not linking back, you're not giving us credit. And you're
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.680]   doing 60 clips. If you want to do one or two clips, and you
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.780]   want to comment on it, that's fine. But you can't take all 60
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:41.180]   clips and make a 60 clip version of this. And so fairness is in
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.360]   the word fair use. The problem with Zuckerberg and with how
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.420]   Google has used journalists content is they are clipping out
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.000]   specific sections of it and putting it in something called
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.580]   one box on Google. So many of you might have said how many
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.080]   people you know how many pounds are in you know, whatever or
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.680]   what time is this TV show on and then the content that was made
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.460]   by the ringer or the New York Times gets clipped and they put
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   just that section David with an algorithm and they give you the
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.240]   answer. So you don't need to go visit that website. This is
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.120]   tipping over into what I would call unfair use because you're
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.600]   okay, eliminating the person linking now let me finish. Yeah.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.040]   If it was just the
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.320]   URL and you didn't pull the headline, you didn't pull the
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.740]   abstract, you didn't pull a photo, that would be fine. There
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.640]   is a very easy solution to this, which is if you want to pull the
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.140]   link and the headline, you pay $0. But if you want to pull
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.580]   anything else, 100 characters, etc, you need to get a license
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.300]   from that person, unless you are doing actual criticism. So
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.320]   there's nothing to stop anybody in Australia right now from
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.600]   taking a screenshot of a New York Times story, or an
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.800]   Australian, you know,
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.680]   newspaper story and writing some commentary on it, you just
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.980]   can't wholesale take everything. And so what we're seeing here is
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.520]   a real time negotiation between private parties into what is
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.900]   fair. And I think Google has a really rich history of sharing
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.440]   revenue. The App Store, they give 70% to app developers,
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.340]   YouTube, they give 55% to creators. And with AdSense, they
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.980]   let you put AdSense on your website, and they give you 68
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.180]   cents on the dollar or something in that range. They never
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.940]   actually disclose the exact percentage. But that's what I'm
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.600]   told it is.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.920]   Facebook has given $0.8 million to the New York Times, which is
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.520]   a huge amount of money. And they're giving $0 to Instagram
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.820]   users $0 to WhatsApp users $0 to Facebook folks, they're too
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.540]   greedy. And what Facebook needs to do is either not use the
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.780]   content, or come up with some reasonable payment and come to
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.540]   an agreement with these folks who are now banding together.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.200]   And they're realizing the traffic we get from Facebook and
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.860]   Google is not worth what they're taking away from with us, which
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.980]   is all that revenue that you know, they earned in the free
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.860]   market. And so this is a free market debate. And I think the
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.320]   reason why I'm saying that is because I think it's a good way
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.720]   to get people to give away some of the money that they're getting
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.120]   out of it, to a certain extent, and let the free market work,
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.340]   which is all publishers should get together in the United
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.640]   States and confront Facebook and say, pay us, unless you use
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.660]   anything more than the headline.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.300]   But Jason, I think these things are interconnected, though,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.400]   right. On the one hand, if you're, if you have an economic
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.240]   stake in distribution of content, but then you're also
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.820]   then going to decide under, you know, an opaque definition, what
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.080]   is truth or not truth,
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.000]   purest form definition of a publisher. Right. And I think it
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.700]   just becomes a very treacherous place for both Facebook and
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.860]   Google to end up in. So it's almost
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.120]   Google's paying the bell, by the way.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.900]   Yeah, no, you're right. Google's paying for it. Facebook's decide
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.400]   not to but Facebook, they said something like only 4% of their
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.880]   their their posts involve this kind of content. So it's just
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.400]   not a big deal for them the way it is for for Google.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.620]   Well, I think it is a big deal for Facebook. They're just
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.580]   trying to make a point here because Zuckerberg's Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.860]   They're being they're being they're being overly heavy handed
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.900]   in their response. There's no question about they're they're
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.420]   throwing their weight around. It doesn't look good. But I'm not
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.580]   defending Facebook. I'm defending the principle. I mean,
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.980]   look, if this Australian principle were used, you wouldn't
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.500]   have the drudge report, you wouldn't be able to create a
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.180]   site of news.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.120]   No, you could if it was commentary. You could put the
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.700]   link and write commentary. It's when you just rip the links
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.520]   people are objecting understood ripping the links without any
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.740]   commentary. Judge report re rewrites the headline puts his
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.960]   own spin on it and then links.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.680]   He would never get caught up in that. Yeah, I think that's a
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.180]   good point. Yeah, I think that's a good point. And the
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.700]   people who are objecting to this are the people who are the people
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.120]   who are the people who are the people who are the people who are
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:24.660]   the people who are the people who are the people who are the people
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.100]   who are the people who are the people who are the people who are
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:25.560]   the people who are the people who are the people who are the people
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.100]   who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.080]   object. What they're objecting to is taking the photo, taking
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.500]   the first paragraph, and the the this the synapses is 30 or 40%
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.460]   of the value. And so Facebook is a better and Twitter is with
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.620]   their algorithms are better front pages than the New York
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.600]   Times front page.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.440]   Well, why isn't this applying to Twitter, then?
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.160]   I think it will ultimately, they'll go there as well. I
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.620]   think this will become the test case, which is if you want to
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.820]   take more than just the headline, and like, you know,
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.560]   basically, that's it, or the URL, if you want to have that
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.400]   little snippet, pay us, pay us something, it doesn't have to be
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.720]   a lot. But this could actually solve if these networks that are
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.480]   making 10s to hundreds of millions of billions of dollars,
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.780]   if they just said, you know what 1% to the news organizations to
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.760]   keep them viable, just like anybody else would pay in a
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.980]   licensing fee for
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.080]   terrestrial. Why is why is the Australian government setting
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.340]   the price? And why are they only applying this to Google and
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:23.860]   Facebook?
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.900]   Well, I think they're going to go right down the line. I think
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.240]   it's just a starting point. But to my point, I said earlier is I
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.340]   don't think the government needs to do this, right? I think the
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.500]   news organizations on mass should get together and put
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.640]   their foot down and say no. And if they would get paid,
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.520]   it sounds like what the government should do is clarify
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.600]   what fair use entails. And then maybe it's just maybe it's a
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   link plus a title. I mean, look, it's never just a link, right?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:46.880]   It's a hyper
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:51.500]   link. Plus the snippet plus the work. Yeah, exactly. Yes. So it
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.700]   is the issue. Right? So fine. So the government should clarify
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.120]   what fair use is. And then if Google and Facebook or whoever
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.380]   want more, they got to go negotiate for it. Exactly. But
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.500]   but Australia is doing more than that. They're setting the price.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.500]   And they're limiting their overreaching policy just to
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.880]   Google and Facebook because they know that if they applied it to
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.400]   everybody,
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.560]   by the way, we do that we already do this in the United
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   States, David with local carriage of news organizations on
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:20.160]   the international TV. So we already have we already mix it
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.400]   up with the FTC doing this with licenses and the public good.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.480]   So it's the extent
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.420]   I think the other thing that you know, is going to happen with
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.600]   all of this is like on the other on the other side of this, the
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.480]   actual media organizations themselves that theoretically
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.540]   could benefit from this are frankly just going out of
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.960]   business anyways. There's a, you know, there's a Wall Street
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.740]   Journal alert for the owner of the LA Times who's about to sell
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.600]   the times like, it's very likely that the times in four or five
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.940]   years, it's going to be a lot of money. And so it's going to
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.320]   be a lot of money. And so it's going to be a lot of money.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.100]   And so it's going to be a lot of money. And so it's going to be
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:51.520]   a lot of money. And so it's going to be a lot of money. And
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.060]   so it's going to be a lot of money. And so it's going to be
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:52.600]   a lot of money. And so it's going to be a lot of money. And
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.380]   everybody's just going to be an individual person, blogging and
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.300]   tweeting whatever opinion they want. Right? So there'd be no
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.000]   money to pay anybody because it won't really matter. But what
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.100]   will be left is then these rules on arbitration of fact and
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.220]   fiction. And I think that that's where we're going to end up
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.400]   that's going to be a crazy place. Because then those folks
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.700]   those folks then really are the puppet masters.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.520]   Yeah, I agree that these traditional publications have
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.580]   like a fundamental business model problem. And it's not
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.460]   going to be solved. Like I think there's a like a misplaced
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.100]   blame on Facebook and Google. I mean, the fundamental problem
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.060]   with all these publications are you go search for a news article
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.240]   on something and there's like 10 versions of the same thing, or
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.800]   more 100 versions. And you know, when when newspapers we saw
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.400]   1000s of newspapers all across the country, and they had a
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   local geographic monopoly.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.580]   But once it all got digitized and moved online, you realize how
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.860]   much redundancy there was you have 1000s of reporters creating
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.060]   the exact same thing. And there needs to be consolidation, it
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.560]   doesn't make sense to have 100 articles.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.100]   Not only that, but a point we made last time, which is, you
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.280]   know, facts have largely commoditized or most facts,
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.980]   like, you know, remember, we used to open the newspaper and
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.600]   look at what the stock market prices were, we opened the
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.180]   newspaper and look at the sports scores. We looked at what
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:11.020]   happened in this place in this place, facts about events, facts
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:11.340]   about
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.700]   the prices of things, facts about sports scores, that's all
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.360]   completely commoditized. I mean, that's like 90% of the content
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.300]   of what people used to read the newspaper for has gone online.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.880]   And so as we talked about last time, newspapers and
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.980]   publications of the like have largely moved into, you know,
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.500]   different sorts of narrative. And, you know, it's created a
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.820]   marketplace that has a lot more competition, because anyone can
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.760]   write that, as we were seeing with substack and medium and
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.180]   as we're seeing with our own podcast, we're seeing with our
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.580]   own podcast. And I think that's,
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.840]   this feels to me like, you know, I went to a media
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:49.040]   conference back in 2008. And there was this huge battle
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   between Google and Viacom. And I was at the conference, and I
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.400]   think Larry Page is on stage or someone what or Eric Schmidt was
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.920]   on stage and the Viacom CEO got up and he's like, when are you
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.700]   going to start paying us for our content? And I think that that
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.060]   and he really screamed at him in a room of like 800 people. And I
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.480]   feel like that same kind of point of view has
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.540]   persisted until there's finally some legislation that they feel
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.860]   kind of gets them justice. Meanwhile, the world has passed
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.600]   them by. And, you know, I think this, this will be kind of some
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.680]   transitory legislation that ultimately the content is going
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.780]   to democratize anyway, and the content creation is going to
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.260]   democratize
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.440]   last topic for me, because I really want Friedberg's answer
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.620]   to this, because I also just saw an alert, how the federal
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.360]   government is opening up a vaccination site in Miami Dade
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.980]   County actually saw Francis Suarez retweeted. What the hell
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.420]   is going on with vaccinations?
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.700]   Are we going to get vaccinated soon?
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:47.380]   I said it in December, and I tweeted about it. And I've
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.000]   repeated it multiple times since that the US has enough supply to
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.760]   vaccinate pretty much anyone that wants to get vaccinated,
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.000]   because we are producing and delivering three to 4 million
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.040]   doses per day in the US right now. And there is a just a
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.440]   fundamental issue, especially like I mean, look at California,
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.480]   you know, they haven't opened up, quote, unquote,
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.240]   vaccination to people outside of tier or what they're called
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.400]   tier one a. And so this is much more of a kind of policy issue,
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.940]   then an administrative issue than a supply and demand issue,
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.000]   there's enough people that want the vaccine, and there's enough
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.260]   vaccine to just let people get fucking vaccinated. And so I
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:30.040]   feel like the market forces are now kind of converging with
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.060]   policy a little bit more than they were a month ago. And the
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.380]   policymakers are no longer fighting and complaining about
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.320]   supply and complaining about constraints. You know, we've got
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.240]   mass vac sites now in California,
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.420]   and we're still fighting for the vaccine. So we're not really
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.760]   fighting for the vaccine. But the amount of money that's being
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.340]   wasted, by the way, in this process makes me want to vomit
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.380]   every time I read about it, that's a whole another separate
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.040]   issue. But it feels to me like we're probably May, June, when
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.100]   enough people are vaccinated that we can have, you know, a
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.200]   circumstance where people are going to fly without masks and
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.740]   be comfortable doing so. But I'm sure there will be these over,
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.480]   you know, constraining rules around what people can and can't
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.840]   do in public for a very long time, like I mentioned, what
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.780]   happened. I do want to say one thing that I've noticed, we were,
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.700]   I was talking to a friend who got vaccinated. And I was like,
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.860]   he said, This is my first time playing poker with people. And
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.020]   I was like, Well, you got vaccinated, like, why aren't you?
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.000]   He's like, Well, I don't know if other strains are going to get
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.400]   me or, you know, if this thing's evolving, and other people are
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.940]   going to get sick. And if you think about what's happened over
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.600]   the last year, people have been conditioned to be afraid. And so
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.880]   even though we're getting vaccinated, even though this
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.160]   thing is moving and working, I'm concerned that we're not going
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.640]   to end up in a more civil state schools aren't opening. People
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.320]   aren't flying.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.260]   People aren't doing stuff, even after vaccinations and science
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.020]   and data shows that these things are okay, this in Florida,
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.640]   maybe there's maybe there's some cases of it. But what I'm saying
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.040]   is like, you know, the human subconscious gets trained first,
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.220]   and then our conscious mind rationalizes what we feel. We've
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.880]   all now been trained over the past year to be very afraid. And
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.480]   then we all come up with these rational excuses about why I
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.120]   can't do x, y, and z. It's like, but you've been fucking
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.520]   vaccinated. You're fine. Like, all the data, all the science is
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:08.860]   go do
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.240]   whatever you want to do. Go into a nightclub. Sweaty next to
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.860]   people. Robbing beats and music.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.880]   Friedberg. Yes. Tell us about the throbbing nightclub.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.480]   Yeah, it's like that.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.800]   I've never seen you so animated.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.940]   It's like that scene from Good Will Hunting. Remember when we
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.060]   talked to the psychologist, he's like, tell us about your rave
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:25.680]   stories again.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.700]   Activate fourth emotion.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:34.220]   Throbbing rave, give up to the mob, pulsating bodies and
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.300]   Did the Molly just kick in Friedberg? Did you drop a Molly
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.360]   at the start of the pod?
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.260]   I think so. But my point is, like people are really afraid.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.520]   And I think I just got the best idea for an episode. The biggest
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.480]   concern I have is frankly less about are we going to get
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.420]   vaccinated? I feel like the convergence between market
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.780]   forces and government nonsense is now going to allow us to all
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.900]   get vaccinated. But she was really going to be like, how do
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.080]   you break through these rules and the fear that basically I
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.780]   want, but I don't understand where where are the max
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.200]   vaccination sites in California and who's eligible? Like, why
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.020]   aren't we just making this thing like a drive through we should?
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.240]   This is where we can add.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.100]   It's ridiculous. You got it.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.240]   We all have absolute violent agreement that California is so messed up with respect to how we're
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.800]   vaccinating. We have so much supply. We're sitting on half our friggin supply right now in California.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.840]   30 million vaccines sitting on shelves. We are now at 75% deployed 80%
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.720]   California's got like four or 5 million vaccines sitting in storage.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.660]   It should be a drive through and you just get in line and you go and
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:34.520]   some places we're doing is in you know, but what we're doing now is you got to schedule.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:35.660]   Oh, yeah, scheduling is bullshit.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.080]   Because you first you got to qualify, then you got to schedule an appointment.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.800]   And then the the clinic or whatever is only open from nine to five.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.840]   And so like how many doses they really administer when you got to make an appointment probably one every half hour.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.260]   So maybe they get through 16 people a day or something like that.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.100]   And prove qualifications.
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:56.380]   Yeah, and they get fined a million dollars and lose their medical license if they inject the wrong person.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:02.080]   So I mean, you're talking about 16 people per day at a site when they could be doing a couple of hundred.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.340]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:07.600]   Well, Johnson and Johnson is coming and that's refrigerator stable, right?
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:07.920]   Freiburg.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.000]   So you don't even need it.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.860]   We now have bought 1.2 billion.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.640]   But let me go back to Freiburg's point about when will life get back to normal.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.680]   I'm not as pessimistic as you are, Dave, about this idea that life won't go back to normal.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.360]   And part of the reason why is I'm seeing so much outrage about school closures right now.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:32.460]   California is one of the only states in the country that still completely closed all the schools and people are absolutely up in arms.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.000]   I'd say it's as big an issue as this exploding crime issue.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.760]   Crime is a big issue in the city.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.900]   It's a big issue in the cities and school closures is the big issue in the suburbs.
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.740]   And if these two things don't turn around, I think Gavin Newsom is going to get recalled.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.840]   I mean, people are just on fire about this.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.740]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:59.840]   But I mean, my point was like our wealthy conservative, you know, friend that lives in Florida was afraid to go do stuff even after he's been vaccinated.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.000]   And I think that's what's permeated everywhere.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.140]   It's just like there's a shark.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:03.640]   Freiburg.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   It's like a shark attack.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.600]   You know, if there's a shark attack, you know, at Half Moon Bay or whatever.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.100]   You know, like, you know, there's a shark attack.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:13.380]   You know, it's like, oh, my God, I'm going to go to the hospital for a couple of weeks and then somebody swims in the lake.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.080]   All the water is great.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.040]   People will jump back in.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:21.580]   I think it's April, David, to your point of when this goes back to normal, because if you look now, people have been saying free, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:25.060]   Would you put a five X multiplier on the confirmed COVID cases?
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.060]   A four X multiplier.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.060]   Five X, I think, is the right medium.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:34.540]   So if you have 30 million people who've had the vaccine, had COVID, you're looking at five times.
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.440]   That is 150.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   Now you have 60 million people who have been vaccinated.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.380]   330 million Americans, 70 million are under our kids.
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:44.000]   So, you know, we're basically getting to herd immunity.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.640]   And if you look at the slopes right now, what is causing the drop in cases this massively, David?
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.680]   Is it herd immunity, vaccine, or are people suddenly wearing masks?
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.260]   What is it?
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:59.200]   There's complexity because everyone assumes that there's one thing that affects the whole population.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.340]   But remember, the way viruses work is they're hyperlocal.
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:07.280]   And so the local population dynamics looked at on a scale is where you see the statistics.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   So we're looking at the statistical results of the scale.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   And so, you know, we saw this in North Dakota.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   A bunch of people got really sick.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   They got to herd immunity in communities.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   And then all of a sudden it dropped off the curve.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:24.280]   When you zoom out and that's happening, combined with behavioral changes, combined with vaccines, then you start to see these statistical things happen at scale.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.280]   So it's not a simple answer, but the answer generally can be we are coming down the slope.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:34.280]   We are getting to a point of, you know, general like low case counts, low death counts, low fatality.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.120]   And we should be living a normal life.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   We're going to be living a normal life.
