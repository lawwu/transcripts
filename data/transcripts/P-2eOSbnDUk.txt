[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.920]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.580]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.400]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking about
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.360]   how to be an insight sales rep
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.240]   and the importance of social selling.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.240]   Now, many studies have shown that customers buy a product
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.120]   if they have a good experience with the sales rep.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.280]   In other words, inbound sales is the first experience
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.800]   someone has with your brand.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.860]   And based on the interaction alone,
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.120]   you either earn or lose that business.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.340]   Now, that's a huge responsibility,
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920]   and it's why I have a deep respect
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.360]   for my partners in sales,
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.000]   and why I'm extra motivated as a marketer
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.860]   to set them up for success and send them high quality leads.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.080]   Just think about it.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.040]   If you recently made a large purchase for organization,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.760]   and you're assigned an account rep,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.120]   and something goes horribly wrong with onboarding
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.800]   or the product experience,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.960]   who is the first person you call?
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.120]   For me, I call my sales rep
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.440]   because they have already built that trust with me,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.560]   and I know they will help pull in the right people
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.220]   to figure it out.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.680]   Nine times out of 10,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.320]   that is a quicker path to escalation
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.720]   than going through my account rep
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600]   at the start of a relationship.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.720]   So today, we're going to have a chat with Laura Erdem.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.200]   She leads a US sales team at DreamData,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.520]   and is a good example of someone
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.400]   who is able to quickly build rapport with prospects,
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.800]   turn difficult conversations into deals,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.280]   and is a master at social selling.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200]   In this video, she's going to give us practical insights
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.720]   into topics like how to upsell while also building trust,
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.000]   how social selling is a must have, and how to do it,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.380]   and the importance of customer first selling.
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.320]   Now on that note,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.320]   if you haven't read "The Challenger Sale"
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.480]   by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.240]   I highly recommend it.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880]   They provide a great practical structure
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.200]   on how to create a customer-centric sales approach.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.760]   All right, let's get started.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.720]   Hey guys.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.200]   Today, we're talking about how to be a sales executive.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.760]   Joining us is Laura Erdem.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.280]   Laura, how are you doing?
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.160]   - I'm doing great.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.200]   Thank you so much for having me, Tim.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.360]   - Cool. I'm so glad you're here.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   You know, the sales organization in general,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.800]   coming from marketing,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.640]   is one area that kind of has a soft spot in my heart.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.080]   So I'm definitely looking forward to this conversation.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.120]   Can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing today
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.040]   and how long you've been doing it?
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.880]   - Absolutely.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.280]   So I am a senior account executive at DreamData.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.360]   So I basically do sales,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.600]   the full funnel sales of our prospects
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.840]   coming inbound to DreamData and then closing them,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.200]   only purely working on new business,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.460]   and then it's passed over to customer success.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.140]   Before DreamData,
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.760]   I used to work in much larger organizations.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.220]   So first I was working at Red Hat for three years.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.280]   Then I jumped over to Gartner.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880]   So I've been working a lot with enterprises
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.540]   that have very stable and set sales processes
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.160]   because they perfectly know their ideal customer profile,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.000]   who they're selling to.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.220]   You get a set accounts you're working on.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.320]   So most of the work is actually farming than hunting.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.200]   And when I joined DreamData, it was a totally new thing.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.920]   And I still, till the day today, think like,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.180]   okay, so what was the actual reason I ended up here?
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.360]   I absolutely do because there is so much flexibility
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.360]   and also a lot of unpredictability in this work.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.860]   So if you like that type of work at a startup,
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.360]   it's amazing because you'll learn much more,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.720]   but you'll learn by doing,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.600]   which is also something people have to start choosing.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.960]   - So it sounds like you're doing like a mixture
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.560]   of like inbound and outbound,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.000]   but most of them are inbound leads.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.640]   Does that sound about right?
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.560]   - Yeah, that's correct.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.040]   So DreamData is very heavily marketing driven
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.580]   and product driven as well.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.460]   So we have a very strong inbound marketing machine
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.720]   and we have a free product that people can come into.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.640]   So most of the leads that I'm getting
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.320]   are coming inbound from marketing, sometimes from product,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.520]   but still they're anyway are being fed from marketing in.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.600]   And the rest of the leads that I am sourcing myself
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.620]   are mostly from LinkedIn,
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.040]   from the social selling activities that I do.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.960]   - Cool.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.400]   From the marketing campaigns that are driving your leads,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.320]   are they a mixture of like your typical like webinars
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.160]   and ebook leads,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.520]   or are they more like maybe further down the funnel
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.720]   where like they're looking for demos and whatnot?
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.240]   - I think it's even higher up.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.000]   So when you think about webinars and stuff,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.920]   it is the thought leadership,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.520]   but we don't run that many webinars.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.680]   I do myself run LinkedIn lives
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.620]   and those are mostly around sales and marketing topics,
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.460]   alignment and so on.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.380]   But those are not the ones that are bringing
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.260]   most of our leads.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.260]   So our CMO is really, really clever on demand generation,
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.260]   like the top of funnel thought leadership,
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.380]   where we do write articles that are easy to find.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.760]   So SEO, big time.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.300]   Where do we write articles?
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.760]   Where do we appear?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.100]   And then when the prospects are actually looking
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.520]   for the solution, we better be there.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.380]   So at that point, we definitely are places
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.940]   where people are looking for solutions like G2, Capterra,
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.380]   comparison articles, HubSpot,
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.860]   and all of those places where people get the credibility,
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.180]   okay, I'm ready to take the demo with this company.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.380]   - That's really good.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.700]   And I'm glad you brought up the value of SEO
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.540]   and just kind of fully activating kind of your,
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.460]   the cross-functional or multi-touch mix, right?
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.140]   'Cause I think you're totally right.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.620]   If people are able to discover your content,
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.900]   by the time they reach out to you,
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.140]   they might be a little more warm and a little less cold
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.300]   than someone just converting on an asset, for example.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.380]   So I think that's really wise,
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.420]   especially going to G2 crowd
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.300]   and getting some external validation.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.260]   And that actually leads me to another question.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.300]   I'm kind of curious, you know,
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.140]   like you mentioned that obviously the leads come
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.660]   from various sources and various degrees of familiarity
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.340]   with your brand or product.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.620]   How do you go and qualify leads
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.220]   or determine that they're actually a good fit
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.700]   for a company or your product and services,
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.820]   or maybe they're not necessarily the best fit?
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.020]   - Yeah, we have a pretty well-defined ICB for Dreamdata.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.020]   So it is B2B SaaS companies that do have a CRM
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.420]   and most probably are above 50 employees
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.420]   and have at least one marketing person.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.780]   And from there, then,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.740]   well, I wouldn't say the sky is the limit,
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.340]   but B2B SaaS is still there
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.220]   and you have to be pretty heavy
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.260]   on digital touches as well as a company.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.620]   So since we've got that defined,
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.180]   as soon as the leads are coming in,
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.100]   so I'm not getting the leads directly,
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.340]   as soon as they book, they book with me,
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.540]   they do go through a qualification.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.020]   So if somebody books a demo with me, we still do qualify.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.780]   So bigger companies, they do go into me.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.940]   Could be that they're, I don't know,
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.180]   fully manufacturing B2B.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.620]   Then I would have to qualify it myself,
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.860]   but most of that work is already done pre-booking the demo
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.660]   or pre-getting into a free pipeline
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.060]   that I need to pick up as an AE.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.180]   But- - I see.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.820]   - You're asking about how do I filter out
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.740]   what's right, what's wrong.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.540]   Let's say a B2B manufacturing 10,000 people company
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.500]   comes over to me and the head of marketing wants to talk.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.380]   Well, I very likely, I would take the call,
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.900]   even though this is not an ICP,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.580]   because I would be curious, what are they looking for?
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.220]   Because maybe one day we would go that route
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.180]   and try to start to build a tool further
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.460]   for companies like that.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.940]   But if it was a total misfit, first of all,
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.140]   I reach out to them through mail or through LinkedIn.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.740]   So I connect with people through LinkedIn or through mail
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.300]   and ask what they're looking for.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.300]   If it is totally out of scope to what we're selling,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.980]   then I would suggest that we save each other's time
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.140]   and do not get on the call.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.980]   If they do exist and would like to get on a call,
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.820]   then I would take it,
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.260]   but would try to keep it as short as possible.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.460]   Sometimes, Tim, I do stuff.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.420]   Meaning that if there is somebody who does not respond,
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.660]   and I clearly see this is not ICP,
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.380]   a company definitely does not need our service,
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.580]   or if they need, they envision something totally different.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.220]   Like let's say they are, I don't know, B2C.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.060]   - Yeah.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.260]   - Then I do write an email to them.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.740]   If I don't get a response,
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.660]   then I send a second email just before the meeting,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.500]   and I do cancel the meeting saying that,
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.620]   "I'm sorry, I don't think it's a fit.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.580]   And if you think this is a mistake,
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.540]   please reach out again and book a demo again."
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.460]   Never happens.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.980]   So they don't have to book.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.380]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.780]   You know, I don't know if I told you this, Laura,
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.740]   I had one taste of experience as a sales rep,
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.140]   and it scared the bejesus out of me.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.980]   'Cause it made me wonder,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.580]   like, do I have what it takes to do this?
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.540]   Early 2000, I graduated from college.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.860]   I'm gonna age myself here.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.820]   And I graduated with a marketing degree.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.580]   But if you remember like early 2000, 2001,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.500]   it was like the dot-com bubble burst, right?
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.740]   So like marketing was like the last position
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.060]   people were hiring for.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.860]   I remember one of the temp jobs I had
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.700]   was through Wells Fargo.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.860]   And I was in the collections department
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.340]   where you're on an automated dialer.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.780]   And so for those listening, automated dialer means
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.060]   there's a computer that has a list of names,
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.580]   and it's making a call for you,
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.100]   so you don't have to input it.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.900]   The challenge is sometimes you're on a current call,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.780]   and the dialer already called the next person.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.060]   So they're like, "Hello? Who's there? Hello?"
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.700]   So by the time you pick up, they're already angry.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.020]   And it taught me a lot about how to deal with rejection,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.540]   how to deal with angry people,
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.780]   and kind of set the tone for a call.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.820]   I'm kind of curious, as you're doing these conversations,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.500]   you know, there are various degrees of calling.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.380]   Some of them seem like they've been screened already,
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.180]   so maybe hopefully not as cold,
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.020]   but what does your typical call look like?
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.180]   Like, how do you build trust and credibility
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.100]   with your prospect?
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.500]   And again, what attracted me in your LinkedIn posts
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.820]   is how you seem to be naturally good
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.020]   at naturally relationship building.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.620]   So how does a typical call look like for you,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.980]   and how do you diffuse all that
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.620]   and turn it into a productive conversation?
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.820]   - Absolutely, Tim, this is hardcore.
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.700]   The phone call thing that you're reflecting to,
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.940]   I'm not sure if I would be able to do that.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.220]   Earlier in my career,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.380]   I used to work at the luggage tracing department
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.220]   as a call center.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.900]   And that was rough because people used to call us
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.940]   who already lost their luggage.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.540]   So imagine that.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.380]   Okay, so let's take this down a bit.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.380]   Like, how does it look?
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.700]   And I don't want to tell you this.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.340]   That's where I learned stuff like that,
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.380]   like empathy for people.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.740]   You're trying to solve a problem.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.780]   So I'm not going to solve a problem,
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.380]   but I'll do my best to listen it out
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.860]   and try to find what's the best solution for you.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.580]   So just like when looking for your luggage,
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.460]   I have to figure out how does it look,
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.780]   what's in it, and so on,
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.780]   and which airport might it be lost in.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.820]   It is exactly the same with people.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.380]   So you're calling me, you're trying to solve a problem.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.220]   You're not calling me,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.660]   you're probably booking a demo or getting a free account.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.500]   So I will do my best to first figure out where does it hurt?
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.700]   What is the problem that you're trying to solve?
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.060]   How big is the problem?
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.620]   Could be that I'm not the right solution for you.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.500]   Maybe I will refer you to someone else to speak with.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.540]   And people usually really appreciate that.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.460]   It's like, guys, you're not looking for us.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.100]   This is way too complex.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.340]   It's like, really?
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.700]   First time I hear somebody say that.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.380]   But I know that from my experience,
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.180]   if I try to sell to you, I will waste my time.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.180]   And very likely you will either not going to buy the solution
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.300]   or if you do, it will be such a small solution
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.700]   that neither you're gonna be satisfied,
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.980]   nor our time is going to be used productively.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.500]   So one of those things is like to understand
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.540]   what it is that they're trying to achieve.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.060]   Then the next step is also to help them
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.380]   to build that business case
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.940]   because in B2B they don't buy alone.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.140]   Even if Tim came over to me and said,
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.060]   "Oh, I need Dream Data.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.380]   I really wanna buy from you.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.700]   This is an amazing solution."
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.100]   Say, "Let's take a step back.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.780]   Okay, you think this is amazing.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.420]   What are you trying to achieve?
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.940]   And who else is in the same boat in your team
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.460]   or besides your team?"
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.940]   Because you as a person, if you bought it,
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.340]   let's say it cost us peanuts.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.100]   You definitely can just pay it out of your pocket.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.460]   You're gonna use it,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.860]   but likely somebody else will be impacted by it,
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.780]   either positively or negatively.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.980]   So let's map out this early that is going to happen
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.740]   after you bought the solution.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.820]   So we're able to see,
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.740]   okay, this is going to be a future success.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.380]   - Yeah, I really like that.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.860]   I like how you first start off
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.500]   with taking a position of empathy, right?
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.180]   Asking the questions to fully understand
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.220]   what a process is trying to solve for, right?
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.540]   And I think what questions you're asking is really cool
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.300]   'cause it puts you in a place or a role
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.140]   as a trusted advisor,
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.900]   as opposed to someone just trying to push product
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.740]   down your throat, right?
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.620]   And I think there is a...
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.780]   What I'm getting a sense from you
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.740]   is like there's a lot of transparency
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.180]   and openness in this dialogue.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.060]   Part of it is like kind of embracing your vulnerability
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.820]   to just have a true conversation.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.260]   I like how an outcome could even be
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.780]   like this might not be the right fit for you
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.700]   'cause even a admission like that for a prospect,
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.700]   you're right, they don't hear that often.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.140]   'Cause like, aren't you trying to sell me something?
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.260]   It's like, no, I want to do what's best for you.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260]   And they might be more interested to listen to you.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.340]   I remember when you and I were exchanging emails early on,
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.260]   we were talking about different methodologies
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.660]   of shaping a conversation,
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.860]   whether it's a challenger sale
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.260]   or value-based selling framework,
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.580]   like that tends to work
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.900]   in terms of these kinds of conversations.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.140]   And just kind of quick review for the people out there,
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.180]   just roughly, it's the idea where you lead
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.900]   with customer first and end with your company, right?
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.140]   So you kind of start off kind of helping them understand
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.260]   their current situation and maybe the negative impact
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.060]   of maintaining their status quo.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.260]   And then you kind of help them understand
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.540]   or discover the ideal future state
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.380]   and what that looks like.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.300]   Again, it has nothing to do with you as a brand.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.100]   It's to them, what's best for them.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.940]   Once you kind of lead them
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.660]   through that kind of identifying the future,
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.540]   then you figure out how do you measure the success.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.100]   And that's kind of where you can kind of start weaving in
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.620]   metrics of success that maybe you might be uniquely
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.980]   positioned to solve for.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.340]   And then you go into how you solve for that, right?
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.100]   And then customer references.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.340]   Can you give us some examples?
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.940]   And it doesn't have to follow that, but like an example
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.780]   of maybe you had a customer conversation
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.420]   that maybe started here.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.780]   And as you kind of help them walk through that,
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.380]   either the validation or understanding of their situation,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.500]   you kind of landed somewhere else
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.700]   that was probably better for them.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.580]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:11.500]   So just recently we started defining the use cases
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.260]   that people usually think they're buying
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.460]   an attribution solution for,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.820]   and what alternative use cases there might be
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.340]   that we're trying to reach.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.660]   And that helped us as well to figure out,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.660]   okay, what types of use cases can we expose to our clients?
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:34.260]   Maybe they're not aware of those, or they're vaguely aware.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.780]   So usually what happens is that most of our prospects
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.060]   come to Dream Data saying that,
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.220]   "I want a multi-touch attribution for my deals.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.060]   I'm closing."
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.740]   This is loaded.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.020]   Let's figure out what's an actual problem
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.140]   you're trying to solve.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.420]   Okay, so where does it hurt?
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.060]   Okay, how do you do marketing?
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.860]   First of all, is that organic?
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.700]   Is that paid?
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.180]   Is it a mix to go a lot to the events?
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.300]   Like how is the mix looking?
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.260]   That you need a multi-touch approach.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.580]   It could be that your clients are actually buying.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.220]   Like you've got one stakeholder, they come in,
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.380]   they have two meetings, and then they buy.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.380]   You don't need an attribution solution.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.540]   But if you've got a lot of stakeholders,
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.700]   a lot of touches in the customer journey,
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.900]   then you need to figure out.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.380]   So those expensive events that we're running,
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.380]   should we continue those?
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.540]   Or should we repurpose some of that budget
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.500]   and drive it to paid when people are actually searching
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.660]   for our solutions so they find us top of the list?
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.860]   We stay top of the mind for them.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.420]   So usually people would come
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.540]   for that kind of multi-touch attribution,
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.660]   but we would have to unpeel that onion so they know,
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.900]   okay, somebody who works with events
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.140]   needs to look into the solution as well.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.940]   Maybe we're onboarded because this will be a part of it.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.940]   Paid, organic, very often they ask about sales.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.420]   Because if you show the full customer journey,
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.340]   sales are interested to have a look as like,
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.540]   how did it start?
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.940]   How do I reactivate?
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.460]   Are they on our website and stuff like that?
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.940]   So mapping this all out,
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.860]   takes your discussion very different places.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.820]   And depending on what people are looking for.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.380]   If a CRO comes into the call of that marketing
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.820]   is starting to look for an attribution solution,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.940]   CRO has totally different views,
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.540]   needs to do things.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.940]   Oh, this is way too deep.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.780]   I don't need that.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.180]   Can you just show me which channels are driving our SQLs?
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.500]   Yeah, sure.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.660]   But maybe you don't need an attribution solution for that,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.300]   but your team does.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.180]   And then it's really persona-based
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.940]   and what kind of use cases they're trying to solve.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.780]   - I see.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.620]   So it sounds like,
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.740]   and I like that kind of going from a kind of persona
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.020]   mixed with kind of whether it was a top task or use cases.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.900]   So I'm assuming like are there situations
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.180]   where maybe a lead comes in
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.420]   and maybe it's coming from a certain campaign.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.460]   So you might assume that it might be attached
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.500]   to a certain type of use case for them, right?
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.060]   But like, as you're having a conversation,
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.020]   you kind of uncover maybe that was the entry point,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.900]   but actually the problem they're trying to solve
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.460]   is a completely different use case
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.660]   that maybe is a larger opportunity.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.940]   Like, does that happen frequently
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.940]   or any examples you're willing to share
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.780]   that you're able to?
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.620]   - Yeah.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.780]   So there's a prospect that I'm working with at the moment
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.220]   and the solution became much bigger
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.780]   than I actually anticipated.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.340]   So they came in saying that we want to figure out
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.020]   which content is working,
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.060]   which content is driving pipeline.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.900]   Cool.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.420]   So they've got their account-based marketing person,
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.220]   they've got their campaigns running person,
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.540]   pretty large account.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.500]   And we're continuing talking, talking, talking.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.500]   And then I mentioned the multi-touch attribution thing
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.100]   and it's like, wait, she's saying,
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.100]   I think we have a competitor where have installed on-prem.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.300]   Okay, so they came for something that we have
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.460]   in the solution that the competitor they're using,
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.140]   they don't have.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.940]   And that means that they actually are looking
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.460]   into having both solutions implemented at the same time.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.820]   One of the solutions is implemented by operations
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.020]   and it's up and running pretty well.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.420]   Management is using,
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.020]   but the marketing team thinks it's not enough.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   So they came for a totally different thing
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.380]   than we have ever that they do have a competitor
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.780]   that they're using.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.700]   But at the same time saying that,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.500]   okay, let's take a step back,
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.660]   assess if that competitor can deliver for us.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.660]   And they can't.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.780]   That means that we need both solutions.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.620]   - I see.
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.660]   And again, I don't want to get too granular
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.500]   'cause obviously there's some proprietary information here.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.380]   But in this case where they're installed-based
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.460]   as your competitor,
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.140]   how do you kind of lead a conversation around like,
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.740]   we can work well together or play nice,
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.060]   or are you kind of advising them on a five-year roadmap
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.380]   to kind of maybe replace, right?
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.340]   Like what does that conversation typically look like
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.180]   for you?
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.780]   - Yeah, this one is,
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.500]   it really depends on what is the competition in place
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.620]   and which teams are using it.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.580]   So first thing that we had to realize
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.620]   is that how long time does it take
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.780]   for somebody to implement an attribution solution?
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.180]   So if they have, they have used their time
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.420]   and they have that bias of,
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.100]   okay, so now we're going to miss out on all that time,
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.620]   means that maybe we should just wait with an alternative.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.460]   And I do come in with empathy in saying,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.420]   this is going to take you additional time
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.700]   to get a new solution if it is.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.700]   And these are the differences,
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.140]   and tell me where you see the benefits are.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.780]   So they can guide the conversation.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.820]   If benefits are worth it for them to go through this,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.620]   once again, maybe faster, but I can't promise it.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.740]   It could be there will be hiccups,
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.460]   but they should be ready for that.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.940]   For me, it would be totally impossible to say,
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.100]   oh, this is going to be thousand times better
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.500]   and it's much faster and so on.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.660]   The solution is likely better,
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.580]   but the time that you spend on the other solution
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.700]   is going to be difficult for you
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.900]   to tell inside the company that now we're switching.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.540]   It has to be like 10,
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.620]   hundred times better solution to go with to change.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.620]   And we have to be open to that because this is like heavy.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.740]   - Yeah, I think it's a good point.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.740]   I mean, I think for all of us on the client side,
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.300]   like how many times have we been in a situation
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.620]   where someone's kind of pitching something
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.700]   that's kind of comparable to what we're doing today.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.900]   What always turns me off is if the message is like this,
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.700]   like your competitor sucks at this,
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.540]   this is why we're better.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.660]   Like that always turns me off, right?
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.300]   I think the empathetic poach is like,
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.500]   hey, cool, sounds like this is what you need.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.100]   And like in some areas that competitor
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.900]   actually might do a good sufficient job,
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.580]   but kind of helping them understand their use cases,
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.420]   for example, kind of maybe broadens,
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.380]   maybe the picture of like,
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.980]   there's other areas of their business
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.540]   that they might be overlooking that may have a shortcoming.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.340]   And maybe there's an area where it can play nice.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.380]   Again, not forcing the conversation,
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.140]   but again, you're playing the trusted advisor role
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.740]   where now I'm kind of believing things that you're saying
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.700]   and kind of being a strategic partner
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.540]   and helping them understanding
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.380]   what does a three-year or five-year roadmap look like.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.980]   And if one outcome of that is replacement,
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.060]   sure, but if not, like think of something for me, right?
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:30.900]   And again, to your point,
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.140]   like I've got a job to do at the end of the day.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.620]   The more value you provide me
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.900]   to figure out how to make these decisions,
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.860]   like the more highly I'm gonna regard your feedback, right?
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.020]   This is fascinating.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.660]   I'm gonna shift the conversation really quick
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.500]   'cause earlier you mentioned like using LinkedIn
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.980]   and I was trying to save that, my questions for then,
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.340]   'cause I wanna do it now.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.580]   Like social selling,
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.260]   especially with where the social media is today,
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.340]   it's so huge.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.820]   And I remember like, I didn't actually even know you, Laura,
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.260]   but I knew of you just by looking at everything
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.540]   that you're posting.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.660]   I kind of got the stories you're putting out there,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.140]   there's some personal, some professional,
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.420]   and I feel like you were connecting with me
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.460]   and building a relationship, even though I don't know you.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.860]   Can you tell me a little bit
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.660]   about like how you're utilizing like social selling
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.780]   and how is it, how do you even measure
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.900]   what works for you in this channel?
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.500]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.580]   So I started, I think now around three years ago
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.020]   when I started at Dream Data.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.100]   I did post here and there,
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.140]   re-share Gartner reports that nobody cares about
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.180]   and stuff like that.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.100]   When I joined Dream Data, then we started to figure out,
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.780]   well, this is a pretty neat channel for us.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.860]   And especially if we do it as a team
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.100]   that will have a compounding effect
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.620]   for all of us to be in front of our prospects.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.620]   And so for me, I started to do that consistently every day.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.780]   Later in the process, I added videos.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.940]   And during the videos, I figured out that
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.980]   if there are some things people can recognize me for,
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.260]   along with I'm saying the words of the stuff
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.740]   that I'm selling, like customer journey, attribution,
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.020]   or content, or some stuff like that,
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.380]   then it will be so much easier for them to relate
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.660]   to the rest of the content that we're pulling out
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.500]   as Dream Data.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:28.500]   So what I'm doing is I'm basically pulling the attention
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.620]   of a person.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.180]   So as you're saying, some stuff is personal
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.740]   and you do remember it.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.340]   Some stuff is including a picture
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.900]   or a very strong opinion about something,
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.500]   but this is what you remember.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.540]   And very likely you don't remember that this is me,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.860]   Laura, who did this, or she works at Dream Data,
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.900]   but you vaguely remember the face,
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.460]   probably the name a little later and then figure out,
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.420]   oh, so she talks about sales and marketing alignment, right?
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.500]   So you start to recognize the name of a person,
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.820]   but also the company the person is working for.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.940]   And of course, the name of the company is also standing
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.180]   just underneath your profile.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.260]   And if the whole team is doing that consistently,
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.260]   then it is much easier to reach your audience.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.260]   And there are several things that we do that,
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.020]   like to nail that.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.220]   We're connecting with people
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.140]   that are ideal customer profiles.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.500]   The reason we're connected, Tim,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.940]   is because you are the person
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.140]   who is interested in attribution.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.220]   Either you're a marketer, operations are likely in sales,
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.660]   and one day when you think of attribution,
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.340]   you know what to think about.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.700]   And it's not any manipulative or anything,
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.900]   but it is just very basic marketing.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.900]   'Cause if you do go and buy some campaigns,
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.580]   you still want to target right.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.380]   When you go on LinkedIn, you do target your audience.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.580]   Who are you going to expose your ads to?
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.380]   This is exactly the same,
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.460]   but you do that through the content that you speak about.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.140]   So I'm speaking about stuff that you care about.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.420]   But at the same time, I do connect with people
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.500]   that will care about the content.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.780]   And naturally other people who are not connected with me
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.660]   start to follow me as well.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.740]   So that compound effect that people who like my posts
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.740]   very likely are your connections as well.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.100]   And suddenly you start seeing them and say,
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.900]   oh, she's all over the place.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.420]   And since it is grasping the attention of the person,
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.820]   then it's much easier to do retargeting later.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.540]   So now our CMO is using me as a bot for conversation ads
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.860]   and stuff like that, because people remember the name.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.860]   - I see, so social selling for you
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.740]   is a department-wide strategy.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.900]   It's not just you as an individual?
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.180]   - It is sales and marketing strategy, it is.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.100]   - Oh, that's really, really cool.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.580]   That's actually, my sample size
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.260]   is just the companies I've worked with,
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.300]   but that feels kind of rare.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.420]   I think utilizing social as a selling tool
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.260]   almost for me has been down to the individual.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.500]   And you're right, most people are like reposting things
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.380]   like this asset.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.460]   And I think what you've done,
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.340]   and actually I'll even categorize for you.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.740]   You do things a few ways,
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.540]   and I'm kind of curious which way has worked well for you
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.100]   in terms of generating business or whatnot.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.540]   So I see a mixture of stuff.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.380]   You did a post once where you talked about
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.420]   where marketing and sales interact, right?
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.980]   And what the role of asset creation, all that kind of stuff.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.380]   And that one was helpful,
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.140]   'cause your post as a structure was like,
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.540]   you provide information on the top 10 things
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.500]   that you cared about that kind of supported
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.940]   your point of view.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.140]   But that one was an open-ended question
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.020]   where you wanted people to proactively come
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.900]   and respond to the comments to build a conversation.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.980]   That was one type of post.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.180]   I've seen other posts for you
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.860]   where you're going to an event.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.300]   It's very video driven, where it's like, meet me here.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.540]   And again, there's always some lead-in,
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.620]   like your description, it's very informative.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.100]   And then there's humorous ones,
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.460]   like you did the "I F'd Up" one, right?
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.420]   That the video did recently.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.740]   I think that was today or recently,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.780]   where you just, it's some silly incident
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.740]   and trying to fill a car.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.220]   And it's again, just a little personal anecdote
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.780]   that just lets me realize,
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.820]   hey, Laura doesn't take herself seriously, neither do I.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.060]   It seems like she's kind of humble down on earth.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.740]   Maybe I want to have a conversation with her
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.140]   if I'm your target audience.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.900]   Can you help us understand what types of posts
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.900]   or construction of posts have really worked for you?
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.460]   Again, I'm not asking you to give away your secret sauce
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.180]   for your organization's strategy,
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.220]   but just maybe some tips
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.620]   on maybe building something that works.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.380]   - Oh yeah, you can get the whole sauce.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.020]   I mean, everybody will try to copy it,
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.060]   will do it their own way,
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.100]   because this is people you're dealing with.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.300]   So you're definitely going to do it differently.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:47.300]   So for me personally, there are two ways of posting.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.180]   The first one is the one that is grabbing attention,
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.220]   getting a lot of likes and a lot of engagement.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.340]   Most of the times it is when I post either personal stuff
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.420]   or stuff about social selling.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.500]   So when I speak about those two things,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.660]   about being a mom, being a woman,
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.900]   I even reposted Taylor Swift's one of the songs.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.500]   It's like about women being like underrepresented.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.260]   Anyway, that one, like a lot of engagements
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.540]   and hates and so on.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.380]   This is nice.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.540]   This is grasping attention, people remember.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:25.140]   But this one brings zero leads, nothing.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.380]   But people see it.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.380]   And then that means that they will see the other posts.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.940]   Serious posts, product videos.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.660]   I do product videos while I walk through the product.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.860]   Click here and there.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.060]   Or I try to show screenshots of customer journeys.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.740]   Literally, how did I win a client to show that
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.860]   in Dream Data, where people get curious.
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.100]   Oh, how did you do this?
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.500]   And what is the tool that you're using?
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.900]   Oh, glad you asked.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.140]   So the reason that they're able to follow the two
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.900]   is because I do entertain, I do grasp the audience,
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.660]   but then later post the stuff that is probably
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:06.660]   do not gather that many likes, but do grasp attention.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.980]   People attack each other.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.180]   People later remember those and get into demos with us
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.140]   and say, oh, I've seen a customer journey.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.100]   Can I see that live?
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.380]   So this is how we do the strategy.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.260]   And if you're thinking of like the whole company,
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.460]   how we do it, we chose not to do topics,
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.860]   meaning that, oh, we're releasing, I don't know,
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.540]   oh, we just got started to type two compliance.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.380]   Let's all talk about this.
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.580]   No, because people will think this is boring
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.420]   and it will be repetitive.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.580]   So we'd rather choose to do it like that.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.820]   So each and every salesperson, for marketing, it still works.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.580]   They do go like topic by topic and so on.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.940]   But for sales, we do pick up a group of clients
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.300]   that you are targeting right now to warm them up
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.740]   and to start getting responses and start posting the topics
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.140]   that those prospects care about.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   What is that their top of mind that we're selling?
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.460]   So it sounds like you're speaking their language
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.660]   and then it's easier to start the conversations.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.940]   It will always land in your attribution realm,
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.140]   but it will not be the same
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.180]   what marketing has just released.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.180]   If it is released, we'll speak about it.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.140]   But other than that,
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.340]   it will be very client-specific and related.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.100]   We would never mention the client,
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.300]   but it is like outbound one to many.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.780]   I'll be speaking about you, Tim,
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.060]   but I'll be posting about the topic
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.900]   that you definitely care about
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.180]   and you will probably see it and never like it,
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.300]   but other people will see it as well.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.140]   And in that way, I will warm up the topic
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.340]   for those prospects to see us as a thought leader as well.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.900]   - Yeah, I think that's brilliant.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.380]   I mean, I think one part of it,
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.060]   you're talking about like understanding
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.660]   how to build your total impression base, right?
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.180]   Like how many total people can see your posts.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.220]   And so even though the Taylor Swift one,
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.340]   while it may not necessarily result in leads,
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.940]   you're increasing your reach
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.380]   for people who find you interesting, right?
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.140]   So that meant it maybe get connections to that
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.420]   or people follow you or repost or whatnot.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.020]   So then when you do, do your more meaningful
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.340]   in terms of something that's like lead generation wise,
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.540]   like because you're expanding the total base
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.700]   of which it can be exposed to,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.540]   then you're just talking about increasing
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.580]   the math of the funnel, right?
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.060]   The more at the top, the more at the bottom, right?
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.060]   So, and I think the other part,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.100]   I really appreciate what you said was
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.940]   taking something that's created by marketing
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.780]   and making your own, right?
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.500]   So not regurgitating, but putting your own spin,
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.180]   target at your customer about something that they care about
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.980]   that puts context around why that campaign matters.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.220]   And that probably converts well, right?
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.020]   So you need to target people through LinkedIn
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.980]   or do a broad post and hoping your target
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.980]   post on industry connects.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.980]   That's fantastic.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.820]   I want to do one last shift for you.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.340]   And this is more around just career growth.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.420]   You know, I'm kind of interested in understanding
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.100]   how you kind of came into sales
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.300]   and then close out with any tips you have
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.220]   for people considering a brand new career in sales
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.100]   and what skills you believe they need,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.900]   both hard and soft to succeed.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.620]   But let's first start with your career journey.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.780]   Like, how did you get here?
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.100]   Was it direct?
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.900]   Or like, did you have to overcome any fears to do this?
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.140]   Like, what's your story?
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:22.260]   - Usually the sales story for each and every salesperson
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.620]   is like, it was a mistake.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.500]   I got there by mistake.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.860]   It is more or less like that.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.940]   If you ask what people have studied at school,
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.860]   nobody ever wants to be a salesperson.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.340]   When you're at school,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.980]   you think salespeople are the ones
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.660]   that are banging on your door and say,
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.180]   "Oh, I've got this to sell to."
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.220]   It's like, "Oh, I never want to do that."
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.940]   But the way I got into sales first, I got into IT.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.380]   So education.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.380]   I finished sociology as a bachelor.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.740]   - Okay.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.380]   - And when I was done with sociology,
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.540]   then I was like, "Hmm, okay, a researcher, uh-uh-uh."
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.380]   (laughs)
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.060]   I mean, the topics are fun, but no.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.980]   And there was, even back in the days,
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.420]   like you're talking about,
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.460]   like I'm going to reveal how old I am and stuff.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.620]   Back in the days, IT was not that hot.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.140]   But after working at that call center I mentioned,
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.300]   I went to the US, I worked there for half a year,
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.540]   like work and travel, USA university stuff.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.540]   I come back and say, "Okay, I need a new job."
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.500]   And I'm called up by a recruiter who's saying,
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.260]   "Oh, I'm hiring for an IT company.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.500]   "I think you would be very good
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.700]   "at coordinating this and that."
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.860]   I'm like, "IT company?
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.220]   "Buddy, I'm not that good at Excel, you know?"
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.700]   I say, "No, no, no, that's all right, no problem."
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:39.540]   (laughs)
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.100]   So I landed at this company.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.660]   It's an American company
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.860]   that was headquartered in Copenhagen.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.740]   And I came here, became a resource manager,
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.380]   like coordinator and so on, knowing nothing about IT.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.700]   And then six years in,
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.620]   so I have been there for six years,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.060]   changing the roles of various coordination,
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.300]   like graduate programs and so on.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.580]   I think I would be good at sales.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.500]   I could see those people in the same company
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.540]   being in sales, I think I could be good.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.540]   Then I hooked up with one guy
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.820]   who was head of sales over there.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.900]   It's like, we have some conversations.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.980]   He said, "No, no, you're very good at what you do.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.100]   "Continue that."
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.660]   (laughs)
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:23.660]   So I left, I got two offers in two large corporations
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.140]   as inside sales.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.140]   And I chose to go with the red hat.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.700]   That's where I started in sales.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.860]   Going from a pretty nice manager position
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.300]   in a big enterprise,
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.980]   then I became an inside sales representative,
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   like kind of a dig down in the career ladders.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.540]   But for everybody who's thinking is sales for me,
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.340]   you have to try this.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.460]   First, even though you go lower into the position
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.420]   than you think you were before,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.580]   the salary will not go lower.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.140]   Salaries and sales are incredible,
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.620]   even for inside sales are really high.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.660]   So if you are money driven, this is for you.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.060]   You definitely earn a lot.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.860]   And from there, then I went through
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.820]   like the very standard career steps.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.660]   I can see the account executives doing this.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.580]   I think I can do it.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.420]   Then I apply.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.380]   And then they say, "No."
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.260]   But then I say, "Oh, what do I need to learn?"
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.580]   And then slowly you follow the people
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.980]   that you admire doing the work.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.220]   It's like, I wanna be like you.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.940]   Come, let's go to the meetings together.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.860]   Let's learn.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.580]   Let me figure out how do you ask the questions and so on.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.260]   And then Gartner came.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.940]   They recruited me for an account executive position
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.020]   to work with the largest enterprises in Denmark
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.060]   with their CTOs and CIOs.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.500]   And who says no?
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.100]   (laughing)
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.300]   The salary was even higher.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.060]   So this is how I progressed in my sales career
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.940]   before Dropshare came in.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.660]   And for anybody who is considering to go into sales,
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.380]   think about a couple of things.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:01.380]   So first, you have to be pretty brave
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.220]   and thick-skinned, I would say.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.860]   Because you will be rejected a lot,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.020]   but you will have to try and try and try
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.020]   and bruises and try and again.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.580]   If that drives you to reach that success,
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.660]   both to reach the salary success,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.940]   but also the gratification of somebody pick up the call,
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.260]   I book the meeting, or I close a deal,
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.300]   then it is an amazing place to be.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:30.340]   Because that drive of a whole sales cycle
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.980]   is amazing to experience.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.260]   It's like a rollercoaster over and over again.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.860]   It's like, oh, a new quarter, back to zero again.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.780]   So it's nerve-wracking, but if you're driven by that,
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.340]   you should definitely try out.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.980]   Because otherwise, you will just miss out on knowing
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.700]   a place where you definitely feel like you belong.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.420]   - Yeah, so I'm gonna project my own fears
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.420]   on you for a second.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.940]   The two things that always scare me about considering sales,
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.860]   one is like, how do I handle objection
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.740]   in a way that doesn't depress me?
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.420]   And the second one is just a general fear
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.100]   of needing to miss a quota
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.220]   and the stress that comes from that,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.140]   as opposed to a steady page job.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.100]   How do you personally handle those two things?
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.100]   - Yeah, objections is a pretty easy thing
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.100]   once you realize why people have objections.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.900]   Is while leading with empathy,
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.260]   if you object to something,
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.820]   it could be it's not right for you.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.380]   One of the books that taught me a lot about that
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.020]   is Chris Voss, "Never Split the Difference."
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.180]   Not sure if you ever read it,
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   but he is a negotiator for terrorists
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.420]   to get the people out from places
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.220]   that they're (indistinct) and stuff.
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.340]   And how he walks through his process
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.780]   of negotiating with a terrorist.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.260]   This is hardcore.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.580]   And when you think about the prospect
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.820]   who gives you some rejections for yourself,
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.340]   why do you feel that you have to get back
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.300]   with a better answer?
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.180]   It could be you don't know better.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.180]   It could be that the person in front of you
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.060]   is actually right.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.660]   We just need to figure out what it is
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.300]   that you're trying to achieve.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.500]   I think very little people are just like angry
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.020]   in themselves and just trying to reject you.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.180]   I don't think so.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.100]   I think, I mean, if you're able
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.060]   to have a nice conversation with a person
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.620]   and figure out what they're actually looking for,
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.540]   then it's not that difficult.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.580]   This one is easy.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.660]   The second one is loaded.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.260]   I mean, hitting the targets
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.860]   and not hitting them is really hard.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.540]   And especially when you've got the team
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:36.500]   of your own peers who you collaborate with,
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.100]   but at the same time, you do compete with them.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.020]   And not in who comes there first and so on,
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.060]   but it's more that feeling of, I'm not good enough.
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.820]   That one is always there.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.260]   If you are like number three or four
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.900]   on the list of the salespeople
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.140]   who did not hit the quota this time and so on,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.140]   this is really hard because every single time
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.060]   you're thinking, am I good enough?
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.500]   Am I going to be fired?
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.700]   How do I get better to this?
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.660]   And that is also, the way I deal with this
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.660]   is having a very heavy background of prospecting.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.860]   Who am I going to work with next month,
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.780]   next quarter, probably next year?
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.780]   What's my target?
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.100]   So if I have that base,
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.260]   then it's much easier to always get back
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.700]   and say, okay, this quarter was shit,
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.620]   but I have a very stable pipeline for next quarter,
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.300]   and I'm going to hit that one.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.020]   And this is not personally me
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.060]   because people are not rejecting me.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.020]   This is the hard part.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.860]   You think, oh, people are rejecting me.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.020]   Nobody wants to buy from me.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.820]   No, this is not personal.
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.980]   This could be the market.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.940]   This could be you haven't learned the right questions
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.100]   to ask and to uncover those problems,
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.220]   to be able to sell to those people,
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.100]   or to involve the right people in the customer journey
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.300]   for them to actually buy the solution.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.860]   So there's always something to find to unpack for that one.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.740]   But at the end of the day,
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.260]   when you're sitting alone in a partly dark room
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.660]   and think, oh, I'm a fucking failure.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.580]   I am number five from seven people sales team.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.500]   That's hard.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.980]   - Yeah.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.420]   Well, I really appreciate
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.780]   this transparent conversation you have.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.620]   You know, I think you're very real.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.220]   I think there's definitely a human element to all of this.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.620]   And I like how you talked about detaching yourself
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.900]   from the rejection and also being self-aware enough
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.100]   to identify the truth nuggets in there
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.340]   that truly apply to you and how to improve.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.900]   And I think your point of view
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.460]   on always kind of thinking ahead
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.900]   and making sure that you build
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.460]   enough of a pipeline for yourself
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.700]   to kind of protect against softness of a quarter
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.540]   and then kind of get ready for the next quarter
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.660]   is really smart.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.340]   So Laura, I just want to thank you for your time.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.900]   I certainly learned a lot from this conversation.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.620]   I think a lot of people who are entertaining
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.900]   this field did as well.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.020]   So I just want to thank you for your time, Laura.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.860]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.700]   - Thank you so much.
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.300]   (gentle music)
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
