[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   You, as we mentioned, have an amazing podcast called Mindscape.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.160]   It's as I said, one of my favorite podcasts, sort of both for your explanation of physics,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.960]   which a lot of people love, and when you venture out into things that are beyond your expertise.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.400]   But it's just a really smart person exploring even questions like, you know, morality, for
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400]   example.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.400]   It was very interesting.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.400]   I think you did a solo episode and so on.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.960]   I mean, there's a lot of really interesting conversations that you have.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.160]   What are some, from memory, amazing conversations that pop to mind that you've had?
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.780]   What did you learn from them?
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.340]   Something that maybe changed your mind or just inspired you or just this whole experience
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600]   of having conversations, what stands out to you?
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   It's an unfair question.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.160]   It's totally unfair, but that's okay.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.160]   That's all right.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.440]   You know, it's often the ones, I feel like the ones I do on physics and closely related
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.600]   science or even philosophy ones are like, I know this stuff and I'm helping people learn
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.040]   about it, but I learn more from the ones that have nothing to do with physics or philosophy,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040]   right?
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.680]   So talking to Wynton Marsalis about jazz or talking to a master sommelier about wine,
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.120]   talking to Will Wilkinson about partisan polarization and the urban rural divide, talking to psychologists,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.760]   like Carol Tavris about cognitive dissonance and how those things work.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.240]   Scott Derrickson, who is the director of the movie, Dr. Strange.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.160]   I had a wonderful conversation with him where we went through the mechanics of making a
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.120]   blockbuster superhero movie, right?
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.520]   And he's also not a naturalist.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.880]   He's an evangelical Christian.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.480]   So we talked about the nature of reality there.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:03.720]   I want to have a couple more discussions with highly educated theists who know the theology
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.600]   really well, but I haven't quite arranged those yet.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.120]   >>LUIS: I would love to hear that.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.840]   I mean, that's how comfortable are you venturing into questions of religion?
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.440]   >>BEN: Oh, I'm totally comfortable doing it.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.920]   I did talk with Alan Lightman, who is also an atheist, but he is trying to rescue the
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.600]   sort of spiritual side of things for atheism.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.960]   I did talk to very vocal atheists like Alex Rosenberg.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.200]   So I've talked to some religious believers, but I need to talk to more.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   >>LUIS: How have you changed through having all these conversations?
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.440]   >>BEN: You know, part of the motivation was I had a long stack of books that I hadn't
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.160]   read and I couldn't find time to read them.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.280]   And I figured if I interviewed their authors, it forced me to read them, right?
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.560]   And that has totally worked, by the way.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.160]   Now I'm annoyed that people write such long books.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.880]   I think I'm still very much learning how to be a good interviewer.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.480]   I think that's a skill.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.560]   I think I have good questions, but there's the give and take that is still, I think I
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   can be better at.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.240]   I want to offer something to the conversation, but not too much, right?
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.480]   I've had conversations where I barely talked at all, and I've had conversations where I
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.080]   talked half the time, and I think there's a happy medium in between there.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.200]   >>LUIS: So I think I remember listening to, without mentioning names, some of your conversations
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.960]   where I wish you would have disagreed more.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.760]   As a listener, it's more fun sometimes.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.800]   >>BEN: Well, that's a very good question because everyone has an attitude toward that.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.200]   Some people are really there to basically give their point of view and their guest is
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.960]   supposed to respond accordingly.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.840]   I want to get my view on the record, but I don't want to dwell on it when I'm talking
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.640]   to someone like David Chalmers, who I disagree with a lot.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.680]   I want to say, "Here's why I disagree with you, but we're here to listen to you.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.480]   I have an episode every week, and you're only on once a week."
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.320]   I have an upcoming podcast episode with Philip Goff, who is a much more dedicated panpsychist.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.600]   There we really get into it.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.840]   I probably have disagreed with him more on that episode than I ever have with another
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.760]   podcast guest, but that's what he wanted, so it worked very well.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   >>LUIS: Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.600]   That kind of debate structure is beautiful when it's done right.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.080]   When you can detect that the intent is that you have fundamental respect for the person,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.520]   and that's, for some reason, it's super fun to listen to when two really smart people
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.120]   are just arguing and sometimes lose their shit a little bit, if I may say so.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.840]   >>BEN: There's a fine line because I have zero interest in bringing ... Maybe you implied
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   this.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.400]   I have zero interest in bringing on people for whom I don't have any intellectual respect.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.320]   I constantly get requests to bring on a flat earther or whatever and really slap them down,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   or a creationist.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.240]   I have zero interest.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.680]   I'm happy to bring on a religious person, a believer, but I want someone who's smart
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.760]   and can act in good faith and can talk, not a charlatan or a lunatic.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.000]   I will happily bring on people with whom I disagree, but only people from whom I think
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.600]   the audience can learn something interesting.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.160]   >>LUIS: Let me ask.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.240]   The idea of charlatan is an interesting idea.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:35.040]   You might be more educated on this topic than me, but there's folks, for example, who argue
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:44.040]   various aspects of evolution, try to approach and say that evolution, our current theory
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.120]   of evolution has many holes in it, has many flaws.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:59.200]   They argue that, I think, Cambrian explosion, which is a huge added variability of species,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.560]   doesn't make sense under our current description of evolution, theory of evolution.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.920]   If you were to have the conversation with people like that, how do you know that the
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:21.120]   difference between outside the box thinkers and people who are fundamentally unscientific
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.600]   and even bordering on charlatans?
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.760]   >>JOE: That's a great question.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.520]   The further you get away from my expertise, the harder it is for me to really judge exactly
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   those things.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.080]   Yeah, I don't have a satisfying answer for that one, because I think the example you
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.640]   use of someone who believes in the basic structure of natural selection, but thinks that this
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.760]   particular thing cannot be understood in terms of our current understanding of Darwinism,
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.120]   that's a perfect edge case where it's hard to tell.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.840]   I would try to talk to people who I do respect and who do know things.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   Given that I'm a physicist, I know that physicists will sometimes be too dismissive of alternative
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.120]   points of view.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.520]   I have to take into account that biologists can also be too dismissive of alternative
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   points of view.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.120]   So, yeah, that's a tricky one.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.360]   >>COREY: Have you gotten heat yet?
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.600]   >>JOE: I get heat all the time.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.640]   There's always something.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.400]   It's hilarious, because I try very hard not to have the same topic several times in a
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   row.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.760]   I did have two climate change episodes, but they were from very different perspectives.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   But I like to mix it up.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   That's the whole point.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.760]   That's why I'm having fun.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.160]   Every time I do an episode, someone says, "Oh, the person you should really get on to
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   talk about exactly that is this other person."
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.480]   I'm like, "But I did that now.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   I don't want to do that anymore."
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.320]   >>COREY: Well, I hope you keep doing it.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.520]   You're inspiring millions of people with your books, your podcasts.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.680]   Sean, it's an honor to talk to you.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.120]   >>JOE: Thanks very much, Lex.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.440]   [END]
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.440]   >>Lex: Thank you.
