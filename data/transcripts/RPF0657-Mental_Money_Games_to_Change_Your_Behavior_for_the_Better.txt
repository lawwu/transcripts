[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.820]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.960]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.200]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.860]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.540]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.540]   Today on the show, we're gonna talk about some money games
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.980]   that you can play to help you achieve that goal
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.000]   of financial freedom in less time,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.540]   hopefully 10 years or less.
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.540]   And no, when I say money game,
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.720]   I'm not talking about Monopoly or Cash Flow Quadrant,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.020]   although that's a useful topic,
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.140]   perhaps that's a worthy topic for another day.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.320]   Today on the show,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.960]   everything I ever learned about wealth building,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   I learned from playing Monopoly when I was a child.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.800]   That's true.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.560]   But we're not talking about board games today.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.060]   No, we're gonna talk about some psychological games
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.640]   that you can play with yourself to change your behavior.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.140]   There's a real balance in life
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.680]   between knowledge, information, and behavior.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.180]   You need to know, but at the end of the day,
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.380]   it's changing behavior that makes a difference.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.580]   It's action that makes a difference.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.980]   You can sit around and dream all you want
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.920]   about checks floating into your life
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.080]   and money flowing into your mailbox,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.520]   but unless those dreams and those visions
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.960]   actually change your behavior,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.200]   nothing will actually change.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.520]   Now, the paradox is this.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.720]   If you can change your thoughts,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.920]   if you can change your information,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.160]   if you can change the ideas that you hold in your head,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.840]   then you can naturally change your behavior a little bit.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.900]   But it goes the other way too.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.700]   Sometimes you can just change your behavior.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.980]   You can change the ideas, you can change the thoughts,
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.680]   you can change the things that are in your head.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.120]   You can change your ability to believe in the future.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.920]   So these two things function together.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.180]   But I wanna focus today on little behavioral tricks,
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.020]   behavioral games that you can play with money.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.860]   And my hope is that these little games
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.520]   will help you to make changes.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420]   At the end of the day, for most of us,
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.300]   our money is generally not a matter of life or death.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.900]   Very few of us are at death's door
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.440]   where a quarter misspent is going to make a difference.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   We're just not at that level.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.740]   Some people are, but you and I are not at that level.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.200]   And so it can be hard to keep your focus
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.320]   on actually behaviors that matter,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.400]   keeping engaged in those behaviors that matter,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.920]   if you don't have some fun games.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.640]   And the reality is, without games, without benchmarks,
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.700]   it's harder to stay the course over years and decades
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.800]   that it may take you for you to get out of debt,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.520]   for you to save money,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.140]   for you to become financially independent.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.600]   So you need games.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.480]   And you'll see this if you study a little bit
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360]   about design, modern design.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.200]   You'll find that most people who are designing
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.320]   some form of financial program
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.520]   or some form of really any kind of app now,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   it's kind of standard for application development
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.360]   for a mobile device,
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.300]   there's gotta be some game associated with it.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.560]   That's why when you're driving around
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.780]   using your GPS program,
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.560]   if you're using a program like Waze,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.680]   you've gotta collect candy as you drive
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.520]   or get points for helping certain things.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   This is called the gamification of life.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.960]   Basically, let's have levels,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.000]   let's have benchmarks.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.440]   And you can see this in successful
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.360]   personal financial advice as well.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.000]   You see this in Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.920]   You gotta have these benchmarks that you can reach.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.960]   You see it in the stages of financial independence
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.800]   that I espouse and that I teach.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.640]   All of these benchmarks really can make a big difference
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.860]   in time and in your life.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.500]   But some of them are just too big.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.480]   And some of them are not everyday.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.960]   So today I wanna give you some everyday games
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.160]   that you can play.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.920]   I generally like to start with income,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.800]   but for this show,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   I'm gonna start with expenses.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.080]   And more importantly,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.600]   I'm going to start with debt repayment.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.200]   And let's flip the order a little bit
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.400]   because most of my games
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.320]   really are on the expense side and the debt repayment.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.920]   I have a few on the income side,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.800]   but it's a little harder
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.460]   to keep this concept running through.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.460]   So let's begin with that.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.400]   So first, let's assume that you are in debt.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.600]   If you are in debt,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.480]   and if you are working to get out of debt,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.020]   which is a majorly important component
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.320]   of gaining your freedom.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.480]   As an individual,
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.620]   if you are an individual
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.160]   that does not owe anybody any money,
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.800]   you will have huge amounts of personal freedom
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.160]   as compared to another person who does owe people money.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.640]   If you owe a house
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.600]   and you don't have any mortgage payment on it,
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.840]   you will be much easier,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.800]   it'll be much easier for you to move
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.920]   from where you live now
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.640]   to a place that you'd like to live
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.020]   than it will if somebody has a house
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.000]   that has a mortgage payment on it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.840]   Why?
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.800]   Well, if you don't have a mortgage payment,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.600]   you can keep your current house empty
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.000]   while you put it on the market,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.840]   and you can go and buy another house.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.240]   It's even better, of course, if you're renting,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.300]   if you don't have any debt there
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.760]   where you have to even sell the house.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.120]   But the point is, if you don't have debt,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.760]   you have more flexibility.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.920]   If you don't have credit card debt,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.320]   then you have tremendous flexibility
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.080]   with your ability to downsize your income,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.880]   change your location, change your job, et cetera,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.360]   if you don't have a lot of expenses being pulled out
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.560]   to make credit card payments from previous overspending.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.420]   If you have no payments,
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.320]   no required payments,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.160]   you can maintain tremendous flexibility in your life.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.640]   If you don't have a house payment,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.200]   if you don't have a car payment,
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.800]   if you don't have a credit card payment,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.200]   you can go and you can hike the Appalachian Trail,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.180]   you can go and backpack around South America,
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.880]   you can go and start a new business,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.240]   because you could probably get by
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.960]   on what you can earn minimum wage.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.860]   So, being free of debt is a massive step
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.620]   in your goal of achieving financial freedom.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.320]   But often, if you've been deeply in debt,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.000]   as I sure have in my life,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.160]   you find that it's a long, hard slog.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.560]   And you probably have found that it's hard
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.280]   to stay focused on getting out of debt.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.560]   So let me give you some games that I have played
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.840]   and that I recommend when you are getting out of debt.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.400]   Let's start with credit card debt.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.640]   The first game that I like to play
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.200]   if I have credit card debt and I wanna get rid of it,
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.000]   is I like to keep it front of mind.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.720]   And I like to make sure that I make progress
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.280]   on paying off that credit card debt every single day.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.880]   And this is really easy in the modern world.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.760]   It's much easier than if you were writing out a check
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.440]   in the old world, paper-based world.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.360]   But today, when you have a smartphone app
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.500]   or a computer connection to your credit card company,
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.940]   and they can do automatic transfers
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.560]   from your bank accounts,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.200]   you can make little micro payments.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.920]   And so, when I've been in credit card debt
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.640]   and wanted to get out, and this is my number one goal,
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.520]   for whatever reason, I use the credit card,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.360]   I built up the balance,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.040]   but now I'm getting out of credit card debt,
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   then I make it a daily goal to every day owe less money.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.320]   What I do is every single day,
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.720]   I make a micro payment on my credit cards.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.320]   That micro payment might be $1.11,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.200]   but I make a payment every single day.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.000]   Now, in terms of the actual impact on your debt,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.600]   it ain't much.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.360]   $1.11 comes out to what, $30 something in a month?
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.240]   So it really doesn't make that big of a difference
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.760]   in terms of the numbers.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.400]   But it makes a big difference in my psychology.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.520]   It makes a big difference
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.080]   in my keeping that goal front and center.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.000]   If I recognize my goal is to get rid of this debt,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.580]   I'm gonna make a payment each and every day.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.160]   Now, long-term listeners will, of course,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.200]   recognize that this strategy might be in contradiction
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.560]   with another strategy that I've talked about,
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.120]   namely the value of accumulating money
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.360]   and having it available to you in a checking account
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.840]   or a savings account,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.900]   and then making large lump sum payments on your debt.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.720]   Both of these things, I think, can be true.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.320]   Generally, how I have handled this in the past
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.800]   is I accumulate money in a separate account,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.260]   but then when it's time to get rid of the credit card debt,
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.920]   then I just simply focus on it
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.760]   and I make a little payment every day.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.600]   And by simply doing it literally every day,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.840]   which only takes a couple of minutes,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.960]   yeah, it can be a little annoying
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.480]   to have to open up the websites.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.320]   It can be a little bit annoying,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.720]   but it's easier if you put the applications on your phone
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.800]   for the financial institution
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.840]   and just make those micro-payments.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.000]   But if you do it every day, it keeps it front and center.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.280]   And any time that I've ever had debt
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   and wanted to get rid of it,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.080]   any time I've ever had credit card debt
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.860]   and needed to get it gone,
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.400]   that strategy is the thing that has always kept me focused.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.000]   And it feels like you're winning.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.620]   When you get into debt and you're trying to get out of debt,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.900]   you're working your way out of debt,
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.200]   I think you face a situation wherein you look at it
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.320]   and you say, "This is enough.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.160]   "This is too much.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.960]   "For whatever reason I use these cards,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.600]   "this is now time to get rid of these things."
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.160]   And then I make it a goal.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.000]   Every single day, I'm going to owe less money
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.820]   than I did the day before.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.400]   And you can do that.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.820]   Now, the game I play is the day
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.200]   that minimum payment posts.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.680]   I pay that big chunk then,
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.160]   and then you pay just bigger chunks along the way.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.900]   A couple of practical tips,
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.260]   things I enjoy doing,
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.140]   is rounding out the numbers.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.540]   And often, let's say that you owe $10,000
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.380]   on a credit card debt.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.880]   You make $1.11 payment,
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.580]   payment of $1.11.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.580]   Well, now, of course, your balance is $9,998.89.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.500]   Well, that 89 cents is kind of annoying.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.340]   So you make a payment of $1.89.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.020]   Now, your balance is 9,7--
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.680]   900, let me do my math right.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.100]   $9,997.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.940]   Then you look at that $7 and you think,
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.000]   "Dollar is just really silly.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.360]   "I'm just going to go ahead and make a $7 payment."
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.840]   And you make a $7 payment.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.740]   And then the next day you look at that and say,
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.840]   "I have a $9,990 balance.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.680]   "That's annoying.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.760]   "I'll make a $90 payment."
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.160]   And you make a $90 payment.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.520]   And then you don't have any money left
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.360]   in your checking accounts.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.400]   You make a $1.42 payment the next day.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.280]   And then a $1.01, and then a $1.03.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.800]   But every day you make a payment.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.760]   And along the way, you just cut it down.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.860]   Some days you pay a dollar.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.780]   Some days you pay $4.13 to get it to an even number.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.240]   Some days you pay $100.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.200]   Some days you pay $900.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.240]   But that daily focus on paying down the credit card debts
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.580]   a little bit every day has for me always been so motivating.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.000]   So motivating.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.520]   Just a practical tip for you.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.240]   If you have multiple cards,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.640]   I think generally anybody who,
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.200]   I always have, it's what I would teach.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.040]   It's what I do teach.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.440]   I have a whole course on this.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.760]   But if you're using credit cards
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.240]   and you have multiple cards,
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.820]   a very practical way to handle the accounting of it
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.080]   is make sure that you always just use
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.120]   a slightly different number for each transaction
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.800]   so that you can identify what's actually coming in
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   in your bank statements.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.400]   Because you'll have so many payments posting,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.720]   'cause you're posting one every day,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.120]   you'll be disconnecting.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.160]   You don't know which is which,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.960]   so you can reconcile everything in your bank account.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   So you make $1.01 on card A, $1.03 on card B,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.400]   $1.05 on card C, $1.07 on card D.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.920]   And then the next day when you make tomorrow's payments,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.480]   you start at $1.11 on card A, $1.13 on card B,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.280]   $1.15 on card C, $1.19 on card D.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.360]   So when on Monday morning you have 15 transactions
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.880]   that all hit, you can reconcile everything very easily.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.720]   So there's just a little practical tip.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.360]   If you're trying to get out of debt
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.800]   and you're struggling or you're not making much progress,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.040]   give my idea a try.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.960]   Give it a shot.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.680]   See if it is helpful to you.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.800]   Because for me, it's always been something
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   that has kept getting out of debt at the front of my mind.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   Now, I've been in debt, I've been out of debt.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.320]   I prefer to stay out of debt,
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.800]   but there are situations when it just simply
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.520]   just makes sense to use debt.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.800]   But I think when you're in that situation,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.180]   if you've experienced the freedom and the joy
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.400]   of not owing any money,
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.480]   it's really nice to be debt-free on the other side.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.400]   So give my strategy a try.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.680]   See if it makes a difference in your behavior.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.760]   Now let me couple that one
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.940]   with one that's also related to expenses.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.760]   When you save money,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.320]   and here I actually mean you save money by not spending it,
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.260]   not you save money by buying something that you don't need.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.320]   But when you come to a financial decision
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.200]   and you decide not to spend money,
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.760]   I think you should reward yourself
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.680]   by actually making a transaction.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.360]   So if I'm at the bookstore and there's a book for $19.99
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.400]   and I look at the book and I say,
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.000]   I'd really like to read this book
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.160]   and I really wanna own this book.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.240]   But right now I'm focused on frugality.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   I'm gonna choose not to buy this book for $19.99.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.880]   I'm gonna wait and I'm gonna put it on a list.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.160]   What I recommend you do is pull out your phone
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.080]   and make a micro transfer of $19.99
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.680]   out of your checking account
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.160]   into whatever your highest financial goal is.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.800]   If you're saving money for a goal,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.860]   just make a $19.99 transfer into the account
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.040]   that's earmarked for that goal
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.520]   because all your accounts really in my opinion
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.600]   should be earmarked for specific goals.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.640]   Or if you're getting out of debt,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.680]   pull out your phone and make a $19.99 transaction,
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.140]   pay an extra $19.99 towards your credit card
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.580]   or towards your car payment or towards your mortgage,
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.880]   something like that.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.560]   To just pull it out and actually make the transfer.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.120]   Or let's say that you are going out to dinner
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.360]   and have been in this situation so many times.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.400]   You go out to dinner, you wanna have a glass of wine
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.000]   or you wanna have the dessert.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.640]   You look at it and you say, "I don't really need it.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.300]   "I'm already having a nice experience here.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.600]   "Do I really wanna spend the extra $7.99
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.460]   "or the extra $12 on this thing?
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.080]   "I don't really need it."
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.440]   Now of course if you wanna spend it
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.800]   and you decided that's worth it to you
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.720]   and you can afford it, fine, go for it.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.240]   But when you make those decisions,
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.580]   you look at it and say, "I'm not gonna do it."
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.380]   Reward yourself by funding a goal that you have.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.800]   If you've got a travel account
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.320]   and you're saving for a big trip,
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.880]   go ahead and make a $7.99 transfer into that account.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.280]   And then that way when you're drinking a glass of wine
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.200]   in Florence instead of drinking a glass of wine in Missoula,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.960]   then you have the opportunity to say,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.380]   "Hey, I'm glad that I said no in Missoula
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.440]   "so that I could have this glass of wine in Florence."
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.040]   So just reward yourself by actually making a transfer.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.760]   Next, you can do this with other debts as well.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.140]   So what about a car payment?
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.480]   Well, try to make an extra payment.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.800]   And here, the strategy is the same
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   with a car payment and/or with a mortgage payment.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.720]   The mortgage payment is a little bit more feasible.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.800]   But here's what I recommend.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.760]   Create an amortization schedule for your mortgage.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.360]   And if you don't have,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.900]   if you didn't do one right at the beginning
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.840]   when you had your first monthly payment,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.640]   then just start wherever you are.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.400]   But create an amortization schedule
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.180]   and calculate how much of each month's payment
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.600]   is going to the principal of the mortgage
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.240]   versus going to interest of the mortgage
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.760]   and create the amortization schedule.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.360]   And then what I do is simply make two payments.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.760]   And make your normal payment,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.000]   let's say your normal mortgage payment is $1,500.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   But your principal payment for next month is $232.75.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.240]   Or write two checks.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.080]   Write your $1,500 check
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   and write your $232.75 check.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.540]   Now it would be really hard for you
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.120]   to make two $1,500 checks.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.680]   But it's not that hard for you to make a $1,500 check
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.080]   and a $232.75 check.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.200]   It's not that hard.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.440]   But yet that makes a massive difference
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.160]   in your timeline of paying off your mortgage.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.480]   And it makes a massive difference
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.000]   in your overall interest costs, et cetera.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.400]   And because you can create the amortization schedule
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.080]   and because in the beginning of having a debt payment,
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.320]   so little is going to principal,
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.520]   you can make those extra checks.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.800]   And once you get in the habit of it,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.000]   then you just keep it up.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.860]   And if you run an amortization schedule,
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.040]   if your normal monthly payment is $1,500 a month,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.840]   yes, because you're paying your principal,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   your interest, your taxes, and then your insurance,
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   your total bills will be $18,000 in that year,
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.320]   in your first year.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.180]   But your total cost of making those extra principal payments
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.960]   will be less than $3,000.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.080]   So with an extra $3,000,
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.600]   you can cut a year off of your mortgage.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.760]   And so you wind up naturally paying a 30-year mortgage
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.120]   like a 15 or whatever your personal term is.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   Those little extra payments go into making a big difference.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.040]   But because they're small and they're weird numbers and such,
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.000]   you can fit them in.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.480]   You can fit in an extra $232,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.440]   but you'll thank yourself decades down the road.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.160]   Any kind of debt that you have,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.040]   make it a game and try to pay a little bit extra,
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.080]   and you'll be out of debt much more quickly.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.360]   This has become, to make these micropayments,
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.960]   for most of us, it has become largely really free
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.240]   to do it to you.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.760]   If you, I think most of us would do this,
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.840]   but if you use electronic access to your bank,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.120]   electronic credit card payments,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.680]   if you use some sort of electronic bill pay,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.960]   then you can do this for free,
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.100]   and you can play these games with these micropayments.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.040]   Will your mortgage company really want to receive
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.540]   22 different checks in a month?
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:10.400]   Probably not, but that's not your problem.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.160]   Let them figure it out.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.840]   So the way that I do this
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.400]   is I use an automatic bill pay service
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.680]   from my bank.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.320]   I personally prefer to initiate all payments
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.920]   to debts except credit cards.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.240]   So what I teach, even in my credit card course,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.120]   I think credit cards should always,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.440]   credit card payments, a minimum monthly payment,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.300]   should always be initiated by the credit card company.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.400]   That way you make sure that,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.000]   and it should go to a separate account
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.200]   that's just for credit card payments.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.400]   That way you make sure that you never,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.160]   ever, ever miss a payment,
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.120]   because you know that no matter what,
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.960]   a minimum payment is gonna be paid
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.600]   on every single one of your credit cards.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.760]   So I believe that's a superior strategy
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.080]   than you manually paying credit cards,
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.400]   because it's a danger that,
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.040]   especially if you have a lot of credit cards
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.880]   and a lot of payments,
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.520]   and minimum payments due here and there
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.480]   throughout the month,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.040]   it's just too big of a danger
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.240]   that it would harm your credit score
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.680]   to ever be late on a payment.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.880]   And so the goal is never be late on a single payment.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.720]   And you can do it.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.680]   If you're someone who's struggled
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.960]   with being late in the past,
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.000]   you can do it.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.640]   I am in my mid-30s.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.600]   I have had credit accounts
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.480]   since I was 18 years old on my 18th birthday.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.320]   And to date, I have never been a day late
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.120]   on a single payment in my life.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.080]   And that helps massively on your credit score.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.840]   It's one of the most important things.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.160]   Well, it's not that hard to do.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.280]   You just sit down and you analyze the problem
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.320]   and say, "I can never afford to be late on this."
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.200]   So either need a really good tickler file,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.940]   maybe you have a 43 folder system
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.780]   or something like that,
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.360]   that you actually sit down and use.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.920]   But my observation, very few people are that diligent.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.980]   Very few people sit on a desk every single day.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.880]   Very few people have a good paper system.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.920]   So if that's not you,
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.700]   if you're not gonna become that kind of hardcore nerd,
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.920]   set up an electronic system that works for you.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   So with your credit card payments,
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.480]   make sure that every credit card
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.680]   always has an automatic bill pay
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.520]   so that you never miss a payment.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.080]   Now, with other things,
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.040]   sometimes generally mortgage companies,
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.880]   you have to initiate the check.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.000]   So when there's a debt that's on your credit report,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.600]   make sure that debt gets paid no matter what.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.120]   So it's good for you to have
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.680]   a standing automatic mortgage payment.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.660]   But generally, if that's your only other debt,
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.780]   you can remember that.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.900]   But if you have a car payment or whatever,
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.460]   make sure that your bank initiates sending of a check.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.800]   It's a little safer in any kind of debtor situation
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.120]   for you to keep all the control
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.800]   and use your bank's functionality
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.880]   of sending out a check or sending out a payment
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.360]   than to give your creditor electronic access
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.200]   to your checking account.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.120]   I concede the argument that it's not perfectly safe
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.720]   to let a credit card company access your checking account
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.140]   on their end automatically.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.880]   That's not perfectly safe.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   But I think the benefits outweigh the risk
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.560]   in terms of the benefits of making sure
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.760]   that you can juggle multiple credit cards
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.320]   and never be behind or be late on a payment.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.360]   You feel free to run your own finances as you like.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.120]   But in these situations, given bank bill pay, et cetera,
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.160]   you can use your bank service,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.480]   and most banks don't charge for bill pay.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.040]   They want you to use the service.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.320]   So here's what I do.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   Set up an automatic bill pay for your standard account.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.000]   Let's say you're paying your mortgage,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.440]   and your standard mortgage payment is $1,500 a month.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.120]   Set that up so it goes out automatically
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.880]   on the first of the month for $1,500 a month.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.360]   But then set up a second biller
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.000]   that just clearly, where your checks
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.320]   are clearly gonna be labeled principal payments.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.920]   And then feel free to make micro payments to your account.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.920]   Super easy.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.320]   You save $200 by not buying something.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.960]   You decide, I'm gonna pay off my mortgage,
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.760]   and I'm putting a little bit of extra money
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.720]   towards my mortgage payment.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.060]   Pull out your phone, click that second option
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.000]   for the second bill pay entry.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.240]   Put $200, click send right away.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.300]   Your bank will mail a checkout to your mortgage company.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.720]   It'll go out in a day or two,
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.900]   and so what if your mortgage company
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.080]   has to process 10 different principal checks?
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.200]   That's their problem, not yours.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.560]   Won't cost you any money,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.860]   but it will help you get out of debt faster.
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:26.360]   I want to again reemphasize that what I'm describing to you,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.320]   the system that I'm describing here,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.360]   contradicts advice that I have frequently given
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.240]   not to make small extra payments
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.720]   on something like a mortgage.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.300]   The assumption here is that you've decided
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.700]   that at this stage in your financial life,
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.900]   it makes more sense for you to pay off the mortgage.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.700]   The assumption is that you have cash,
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.740]   and the assumption is that you're in the kind of situation
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.560]   where you have a regular income.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.340]   If I didn't have a regular income,
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.940]   and if I hadn't decided to pay extra on a mortgage,
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.760]   I wouldn't do that,
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.520]   and we'll talk about games of saving money in just a moment.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.700]   But I still think this is worth discussing,
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.780]   because first, there is big benefit in being out of debt.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.120]   People who are in a stable income situation
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.200]   do benefit by making payments on,
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.160]   on extra payments on debt.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.800]   And in this,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.280]   by using these games,
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.000]   you can change your actual spending behavior.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.720]   There is a question that we always face in personal finance.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.800]   Is it better to pay off debt or invest?
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   Well, there are, the answer to that question is mathematical.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.060]   I've done an hour and a half show on it,
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.760]   so I'm gonna skip, refer you back to the archives
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.160]   for that hour and a half show.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.920]   But the answer is mathematical.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.560]   Whichever option gives you a higher rate of return
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.600]   is the superior option.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.820]   So in general, if your debt is at a low interest rate,
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.880]   such as 0% credit cards,
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.040]   such as low mortgage rates, et cetera,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.320]   kind of good, safe debt that's at low interest rates,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.760]   well-financed, in general,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.800]   you're better off investing than you are paying off debt.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.400]   Unless, in my opinion,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.600]   unless there's a behavioral change
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.520]   that you can make because of the nearness
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.560]   of being able to pay off debt.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.280]   And unless you can gain benefits of being debt-free
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.480]   that you can't gain with having extra money in the bank.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.600]   So being out of credit card debt
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.020]   can give psychological benefits that are very motivating.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.360]   Not having a home mortgage
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.960]   can give psychological benefits that are very motivating.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.160]   There are some people
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   who are very comfortable with investing
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.240]   who won't have any behavioral change
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.160]   if they have a $200,000 mortgage
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.680]   and $200,000 in their investment account.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.240]   And they'd rather invest the money
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.920]   than pay off the mortgage.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.900]   Those people exist.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.520]   My guess is you're probably not one of them.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.980]   Because I think, maybe if I make it up a percentage,
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.920]   maybe 20%.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.760]   80% of people, I think, would be far happier,
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   far more confident if they had no mortgage.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.240]   And then they were just a little bit behind
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.680]   in building up their investment account again.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.280]   Now back to modifying behavior.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.180]   If getting out of debt is such a pressing,
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.800]   close personal goal
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.480]   that it causes you to change your behavior,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.400]   it's worth pursuing it.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.760]   When you look at the success of the gazelle intensity
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.160]   that Dave Ramsey teaches,
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.600]   and you look at the millions of dollars of debt
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.000]   that have been paid off,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.580]   it comes not because of the mathematics
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.800]   of paying off debt being superior
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.600]   to the mathematics of investing.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.860]   It comes because of the change of behavior.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.040]   When somebody grabs onto a short-term goal,
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.120]   such as, I'm gonna get out of debt,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.220]   and if that goal is within an appropriate timeline,
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.880]   a year, two years, something like that,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.040]   where they can grasp it and they can believe it,
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.960]   then it changes,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.560]   it has the opportunity to change the behavior.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.960]   So it has the opportunity to cause a person to work more,
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.880]   so that they earn more.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.700]   It has the cause of a person to spend less,
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.960]   so they can pay extra on debts.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.400]   And it seems to be much more motivating
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.620]   than the people who change their behavior
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.460]   to just put more money in their 401k.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.420]   Now the trick that you can use if you are investing,
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.260]   let's move now to investing.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.900]   The trick that you can use if you're investing
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.780]   is try to make your goals very close at hand,
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.460]   and try to always take and put a game for yourself
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.300]   where you believe you'll be able to,
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   so that you'll be able to achieve a certain goal
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.980]   within a measurable timeframe.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.520]   Make sure those goals are not so big
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.800]   that it's gonna take you 10 years to reach them,
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.780]   and make sure that there's a reward associated with them.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.020]   For some people, spending rewards are appropriate.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.000]   For example, if I can save $10,000
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.220]   towards my financial freedom,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.100]   and I can put it in this account here,
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.220]   towards my big Fi account,
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.940]   and I can do that by June 1st,
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.500]   then I'm going to allow myself
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.480]   to spend this money on this thing
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.920]   that I really would like,
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.240]   but I don't really need it over here.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.880]   So some kind of trade-off like that.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.340]   To game an investment strategy
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.980]   is gonna require a little bit more thought
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.060]   and some more personal application
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.540]   than as simple as paying off debt.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.620]   But here are some thoughts,
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.660]   so some recommendations.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.460]   First, it's relatively easy
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.060]   to have many different bank accounts in today's world.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.900]   And I would recommend
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.140]   that you always name your bank accounts,
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.780]   especially if they are accumulation goals.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.520]   So if you're saving for a house,
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.860]   make sure your bank account is named House Savings Fund.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.540]   If you're saving for a car,
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.640]   make it Car Savings Fund, and keep that separate.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.060]   Don't just have one account where everything is in there,
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.220]   unless you have, maybe you have a bookkeeping system
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.460]   where it's everything in one account,
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.540]   but you keep separate accounts
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.900]   in an artificial structure, that's fine.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.260]   But make sure you have a separate account
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.740]   so you know how much is going in there.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.700]   And then have a first and foremost goal.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.340]   So if you're gonna change your behavior
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.180]   so that you can fund an investment account,
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.660]   you've gotta have a primary goal.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.060]   Now you can put savings and investments on auto payment.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.540]   If you have a regular income,
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.460]   and you say, I'm gonna put this money,
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.300]   defer this money into my 401k,
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.860]   I'm gonna automatically put aside $200 into this account,
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.940]   $300 into this account, and $1,000 into this account.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.460]   But then have another account
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.060]   that you're going to play the game with yourself.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.460]   Of if I don't spend this,
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.300]   I'm going to save this money into this other account.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.300]   Probably that's an account that's fun for you.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.620]   Something like travel,
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.220]   or something that you think is fun, giving account,
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.300]   I don't know.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.500]   But have something where it's gonna be meaningful for you
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.460]   to defer that $20 expense to the future,
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.740]   and then simply put it into a certain account.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.740]   And hopefully the account is at a scale
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.780]   where you can actually see it grow.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.500]   That is the key.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.620]   If you're having behavior modification,
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.740]   where you're forcing yourself to spend less
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.860]   so that you can accomplish something,
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.420]   now you can start to make some progress.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.300]   The end of the day,
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.900]   most of the games that you are going to play
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.660]   are going to be related to having a reward
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.740]   for lowering your expenses.
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.440]   The goal with expenses is to get all the ones
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.300]   that there's not a positive benefit to as low as possible.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.180]   There are categories of expenses
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.220]   that you gain a benefit from.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.540]   Give you an example, that book example I used.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.420]   1999 at the bookstore.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.740]   Should I spend the 1999 or not?
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.740]   Well, welcome to the wrestling of my life
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.620]   for the last, for all of my life.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.260]   Do I spend the 1999?
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.180]   On the one hand, I probably don't need to spend the 1999
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.460]   because I've got plenty of books that I haven't read.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.300]   I probably should read all those books first.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.060]   And it adds up quick when you spend 20 bucks here,
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.860]   20 bucks there, pretty soon you're talking real money.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.700]   But on the flip side, the idea that may come
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.700]   from a 1999 book, or the motivation that may come
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   from a 1999 book, could allow me to make $9,999 next month.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.920]   It could allow me to save $900 this month
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.580]   because I learned some, I gained some benefit.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.580]   So the way that I handle expenses like that
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.620]   is by trying to set a target and funding them.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.420]   So for example, one of the fun games
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.380]   that I think you should make is set aside
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.340]   about 10% of your income and earmark that 10%
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.660]   of your income of always investing in yourself.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.460]   Investing into developing yourself.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.460]   Most of us are, we are the economic engines that drive us.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.300]   And so we wanna invest first in ourselves.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.940]   And so set aside a budget where you're just simply choosing
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.060]   a percentage of money that goes into this
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.940]   so that you can spend freely on things
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.060]   that you're investing in yourself.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.340]   I think you pick the number, 5%, 10% is fine.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.140]   But let's say 5%.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.140]   Well, 5% of $50,000 is $2,500 a year,
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.620]   a little about $200 a month.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.060]   Now, if you give yourself a self personal development budget
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.740]   of $200 a month, you can do really well.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.380]   And now you always have an account
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.220]   so you can make that $1,999 purchase.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.900]   You just simply look and say, do I have money left
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.260]   in my personal development account?
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.700]   Yeah, I do, so I'll buy the book
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.540]   and make sure it's earmarked under personal development.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.180]   Expenses like that should be done intentionally.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.120]   Think of it like research and development for a company.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.100]   A company who's gonna grow
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.620]   and is gonna have a long-term future
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.220]   has to commit to spending money on research and development
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.060]   at every stage along the way,
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.080]   really regardless of how they're doing.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.780]   If the company is doing poorly
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.460]   and they cut back on their research and development budget,
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.660]   are they really gonna start doing better?
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.460]   And if a company is doing well
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.240]   and they cut back on their research and development budget,
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.200]   are they going to keep doing well?
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.860]   Think of personal development
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.140]   as research and development for yourself.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.600]   So you should always have an account.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.340]   That's the account that you buy books out of.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.580]   That's the account that you buy courses out of.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.160]   That's the account that you buy conference tickets out of.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.700]   That's the account that you pay consulting fees out of.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.620]   This is all self-development, personal development.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.500]   And what I do is I categorize those accounts
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.900]   based upon percentage.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.500]   I'm gonna invest a percentage of my income.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.460]   Now, as your income goes,
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.460]   it can be tough to spend the money, right?
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.820]   It's one thing to invest 5% into yourself
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.780]   when you are making $50,000 a year.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.220]   That's really doable.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.940]   Couple of conferences a year,
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.980]   couple of dozen books a year,
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.460]   audio course here or there,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.700]   you've spent the money.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.740]   It's a little harder to invest 5% in yourself
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.100]   when you're making half a million dollars a year.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.180]   More than that.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.720]   But the principle still holds the same.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.780]   That's your research and development budget.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.780]   Now, that's very different than an expense
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.780]   that's simply a consumption expense.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.100]   So the glass of wine example at the nice dinner out,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.220]   that's obviously a purely a consumption expense.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.300]   Would it be pleasurable to have the glass of wine?
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.900]   Sure, probably.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.380]   Could I save the money on it?
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.800]   Yeah, I do, I could.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.420]   Is it gonna cost me anything
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.780]   if I don't drink the wine and save the $9?
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.540]   No, it's not gonna cost me anything.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.900]   I can't make an argument that somehow
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.340]   I'm gonna be wealthier or happier
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.660]   because I had the wine.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.560]   Yeah, you would enjoy it,
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.380]   but it's just one of those things.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.580]   So expenses like that,
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.940]   you set it as a goal of saying,
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.380]   I'm gonna get this as low as possible.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.020]   Now, when you have a pressing goal
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.580]   and you can identify expenses
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.740]   that don't serve you in some way,
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.540]   it's not your vitamin budget
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.580]   or your nutritional supplement budget
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.320]   or your personal development budget,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.420]   which needs to be managed in some way
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.520]   that really makes sense,
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.180]   but not put to the zero,
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.780]   then play the game.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.220]   So you'll see people who are getting out of debt.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.740]   They'll do things like not spending any money this week
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.060]   or not spending any money this weekend.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:10.780]   If you are prone to thoughtless spending on a weekend,
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.340]   set yourself a goal of saying,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.060]   how can I not spend any money this weekend?
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.060]   Doesn't mean you have to sit at home
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.060]   and can't do anything fun.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.980]   It just means that you have to make different choices
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.300]   with the things that you do consume
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.380]   such that they don't cost you money.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.500]   Or you say, I'm not gonna buy any new clothes
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.160]   during this year.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.300]   I have plenty of clothes.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.980]   If your weakness is something like clothes,
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.580]   I'm not gonna buy any new clothes this year.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.700]   We're assuming you have enough clothes to look presentable
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.860]   and you do clothes spending
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.620]   because that's just something fun
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.460]   or if the guy is, I don't know,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.500]   I'm not gonna buy any new guns this year.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.060]   So, or whatever, I don't know, think up your own thing.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.580]   But by setting a target that's long and stretch it out,
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.020]   you change your behavior.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.940]   So I'm not gonna spend any money this month.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.300]   We're not gonna buy food this month.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.860]   We're gonna eat the pantry.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.060]   And then make sure you save that quickly
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.780]   over into your savings.
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.340]   Or another thing, another game that I play with myself
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.140]   when I have an expense is, let's say I have an expense.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.500]   This is not an expense that needs to be maximized
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.940]   like a personal development budget
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.500]   or an education budget, things like that.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.660]   Rather, this is an expense that needs to be managed.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.500]   Can I come up with a way to do this thing
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.460]   and not lose money on it?
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.300]   Assume for a moment that you would like to buy a new car.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:32.020]   Well, calculate how if I bought this new car,
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:36.260]   could I make sure that I pay for this car
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.580]   exclusively from money that I earn with the car
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:44.060]   so that I don't lose money?
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.380]   You have a normal income, normal expenses,
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.780]   you're building wealth, you're saving money,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.740]   but you'd like to buy the new car.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.220]   Well, are you willing to drive the car
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.260]   at nights and on weekends, three or four days a week,
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.780]   to make money with Uber until you can pay for the car
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.820]   with your after-tax earnings from Uber?
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:05.220]   That would be the kind of game that changes your behavior.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.940]   You wanted to buy a thing,
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.020]   but you didn't wanna spend money on it,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.020]   so you changed your behavior and you worked more
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.220]   in order to buy the thing.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.020]   Now, Uber is not a particularly
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.700]   financially productive thing.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.060]   You're making six, seven bucks an hour, basically.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.220]   Most people who drive for Uber
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.420]   don't know how to calculate true cost.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.700]   So as a full-time thing,
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.140]   it doesn't actually work very well.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.380]   But where it does work well
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.300]   is as just a part-time thing.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.140]   So your monthly car payment is gonna be $300 a month,
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.300]   and your goal is to earn $300 every month
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.860]   driving on Uber here and there
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.580]   when it's convenient for you.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.540]   There's a game.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.900]   Now, you can justify to yourself your new car
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.340]   in a way that you couldn't before
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.820]   because you've changed your behavior.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.620]   You can do this when you buy things.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.340]   For example, you want to buy a boat.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.060]   Can you find a boat that's such a good deal
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.400]   that you can buy it,
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.740]   use it for three or four years,
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.620]   and then sell it at the end of three or four years
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.900]   and not lose money on it?
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.340]   That's a real skill involved with that,
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.740]   but I think it's doable.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.460]   I recently did this with my campers and trucks and things.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.300]   I wound up buying a total of two campers and two trucks.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.700]   I bought them all,
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.540]   used them all for about a year or so,
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.820]   put money into them, fixed them, et cetera.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.660]   But at the end of the day,
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.980]   because I bought them right,
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.020]   I was able to eventually sell them all,
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.680]   and I didn't come out with any net loss.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.200]   I didn't make money,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.680]   but I didn't come out with any net loss of money.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.720]   So I recouped all the money out of them.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.240]   Was it a totally a win?
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.360]   No, I could have invested the money probably productively,
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.200]   but I wanted to have them.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.040]   I wanted to use them.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.920]   I did use them.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.560]   And so the goal was simply,
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.000]   can I buy right and can I be really good
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.680]   with how I manage things
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.320]   such that I can sell them eventually and not lose money?
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.140]   Now, in my case,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.220]   the only reason that worked out the way that it did
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.460]   was because one of my trucks got stolen
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.780]   and I negotiated pretty tough with the insurance company.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.780]   And I got a very nice insurance settlement,
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.700]   which made up for some of the depreciation
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.780]   that I suffered on other things.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.820]   But one of my campers,
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.300]   I bought it and doubled my money when I sold it,
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.140]   my truck camper.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.060]   I bought it for half price,
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.140]   used it for six months,
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.380]   and then sold it for double my money.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.020]   So it wasn't much money,
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.580]   but it's the game of it.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.900]   It's the game of saying,
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.440]   okay, I wanna have this thing that I'd like to do.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.280]   This is a consumptive expense.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.700]   This is a bit of a luxury.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:32.020]   How can I play a game so that I can justify this
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.700]   so that I'm changing my behavior?
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.400]   How can I adjust my behavior?
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   Because if I just keep spending, spending, spending
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.560]   and buying all the fun things that I'd like to have,
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.600]   I won't have any money.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.000]   I won't be financially independent.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.920]   I won't be financially free.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.360]   I have a lot of nice stuff,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.160]   but I won't be financially free.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.840]   I wanna be financially free,
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.320]   but I'd also like to have some fun.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.680]   I don't wanna sit around and be a miser
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.780]   just stacking my gold coins up to the roof
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.780]   and never doing anything interesting.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.200]   So is there a game I can play that allows me to do that?
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.920]   Can I come up with a way to buy this thing
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   and not lose money?
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   You're living in an apartment.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.120]   You'd like to buy a house,
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.420]   but you can't justify it.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.220]   Well, what's your game?
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.320]   Buy the house and get two or three roommates.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.000]   Are you willing to have the two or three roommates
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.760]   in your house paying your mortgage for you?
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.000]   Go for it if so.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.680]   Now you can play a game that makes you enjoy
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   having your own pool and your own big kitchen
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.440]   and your own garage and your own things
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.240]   that you can entertain or do whatever you want with,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.600]   and your roommates pay the mortgage payment for you.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.000]   That's the kind of game that makes a difference.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.640]   Notice that every example that I've given you so far
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.080]   is changing your behavior in some way
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.240]   so that you can actually make progress.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.040]   With investing, I did a whole show
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.680]   on get a little bit richer every single day.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.480]   Make it a goal to get a little bit richer every single day.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.400]   Well, how do you do that?
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.720]   It can be difficult,
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.960]   depending on the swings of your investment accounts
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.320]   if you're tracking your net worth on a daily basis,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.520]   but in general, it just simply means
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.720]   saving money every single day.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.600]   So if you're committed to getting a little bit richer
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.160]   every single day,
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.000]   just make sure that you save money every single day.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.060]   Many people do this with the simplest and lowest of budgets
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.480]   with regard to how they manage their cash.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.320]   Knew a guy one time,
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.880]   he was using the strategy of funding a vacation.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.920]   He wanted to fund a vacation.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.500]   So his rule was anytime he got a $5 bill, he had to save it.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.800]   You got a $5 bill, given it and change,
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.480]   $5 bill went into saving every single day.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.600]   Well, if you do that,
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.360]   and if you spend cash and go here and there,
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.040]   I mean, it adds up pretty quickly.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.280]   He needed a few hundred dollars so he could go on vacation,
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.520]   and his way of playing his game
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.160]   to get it out of his budget
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.460]   was anytime there was a $5 bill in his wallet,
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.840]   that was saved.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.380]   I think it's a good game, a really good game.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.040]   You can play this with rounding up.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.120]   Some people do it with,
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.840]   if you ever get coins as change,
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.440]   they always save the coins.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.940]   Or some banks offer this program where you spend $1.62,
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.560]   they'll round it up and put 38 cents into a savings account.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.920]   I say do it with an automatic transfer.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.820]   Set up an automatic transfer every single day
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.720]   into your wealth building account,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.120]   where every day, a dollar goes from your checking account
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.240]   into your savings account.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.920]   And then set yourself a goal of once a month doubling it.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.880]   Things like that, where it's a mental game,
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.560]   where every month I'm gonna double this.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.160]   I'm gonna start with a dollar a day,
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.240]   but then a month from now I'm gonna do $2 a day.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.440]   Then another month I'm gonna do $4 a day.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.640]   Then another month I'm gonna do $8 a day.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.060]   Well, how much are you saving
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.200]   if you can play that kind of game with yourself
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.320]   at the end of a month?
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.760]   Sorry, I meant at the end of a year.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.880]   Well, it's a couple thousand dollars, too much.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   So the game, probably that's unbelievable for many people
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.200]   that they could actually do it.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.680]   So set a more reasonable game, 10% increase.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.600]   That might be a better thing.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.000]   I'm gonna save a dollar a day,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.280]   and then I'm gonna increase it by 10% every month.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.840]   That's probably a more reasonable way.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.680]   So at the end of the month, you're saving hundreds of dollars.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.840]   These games, where you really commit to it,
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.520]   make a big, big difference.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.200]   Now, let's talk about income.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   Income, I think, is a harder game to play
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.600]   depending on how your income is structured.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.240]   But what I would say is set yourself some kind of target.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.080]   If you are in a game,
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.280]   if you're in an income-creating situation
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   where there's a direct connection
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.600]   between your activities and your income, like sales.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.200]   If I do a certain number of sales calls,
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.920]   I'll generate a certain number of transactions
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.280]   in the fullness of time.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.840]   So I'm gonna make a game
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.340]   of doing this number of transactions.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.100]   That's easier to play games with your income.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.320]   But you could still set it.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.720]   Set yourself a target of a certain size of bonus.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.560]   Set yourself a target of increasing your income
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.760]   by a certain amount.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.080]   If you've got something that you'd like to do,
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.440]   some kind of frivolous experience,
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.760]   I'll give you one of mine.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.640]   There's a company that makes leather bags
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.040]   called Saddleback Leather.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.480]   They're super cool if you like leather bags.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.320]   I do.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.520]   They last forever, blah, blah, blah.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.560]   It's a luxury item.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.200]   I cannot justify it whatsoever.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.000]   I just think they're super, super cool.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.260]   They're not particularly practical, but they're beautiful,
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.000]   and they fit my, I like it.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.440]   I like the guy who started the company
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.640]   and his family live in tents,
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.840]   which I think is pretty cool.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.440]   Tents in, safari tents in Texas.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.160]   But this kind of thing, that's one of my rewards,
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.220]   I have an income goal.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.760]   When I reach this certain income goal,
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.080]   I'll go ahead and buy the Saddleback Leather bag
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.080]   that I want.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:23.000]   Now, I can't justify, it's certainly not a,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.800]   it's certainly not an expense that I can defend.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.600]   It's not something that I can say this has to be done.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.800]   But it motivates me,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.320]   and it's a token of a certain level of financial income
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.600]   that I'd like to create.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.800]   Now, your token may vary.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.720]   Your token might be to go ahead and buy the Maserati.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.760]   Your token might be to go ahead and buy the Beach House.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.080]   Your token might be to go ahead and buy
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.980]   the new pair of shoes.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.520]   We all would have different tokens.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.320]   But the point is, if the token is causing you
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.560]   to make a change, it's not actually an expense,
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.120]   it's an expense that you can justify
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.560]   from the business perspective.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.880]   Let's say your goal is to buy the Maserati.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.480]   Well, you set yourself the goal.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.040]   When I get the job, earning this amount of money,
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.480]   then I'll go ahead and buy the Maserati.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.680]   If the Maserati is motivating to you,
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:19.160]   then it actually is having a behavioral change on you,
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.800]   and you do the steps needed to get the certain kind of job.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.120]   And so that's how I like to justify
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.000]   kind of frivolous expenses.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.920]   I would never justify a silly leather bag
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.160]   as making a difference,
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.080]   but because it's one of those frivolous things
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.960]   that I'd like to have, well, how am I gonna justify it?
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.560]   Can't justify it, just say I have the money.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.520]   Of course I have the money.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.080]   Could go and do it any time.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.580]   You could go buy the Maserati.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.160]   But when you justify it and say,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   how can I change my performance,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.440]   then there's, you can, the game is afoot.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.880]   It really works.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.280]   I'm gonna change my performance
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.960]   in order to get this certain outcome,
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.600]   and then with this certain outcome,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.680]   then I'll go ahead and get this thing.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.480]   So that's the best I've got with income.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.360]   I struggle to know other things,
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.960]   I guess other than to say this.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.160]   One of the things, I think I did a show on this.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.500]   If not, it's still on my list,
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.600]   but of changing expenses to a very reasonable level
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.000]   of expenses that you can understand.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.040]   In my case, it's daily expenses.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.440]   For example, if you're starting a business
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.760]   and you want a digital business
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.640]   that has a certain level of recurring revenue
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.800]   that comes in every single day,
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.960]   well, set yourself a goal.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.100]   First goal is to earn a dollar a day.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.220]   That's doable.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.160]   Once you earn a dollar a day, you can go to $10 a day.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.040]   And once you go from $10 a day to $100 a day,
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.120]   now you can afford to live on your recurring income.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.000]   And so the money game is just simply daily.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.200]   How can I build a system where I have $100 a day
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.480]   coming in every day?
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.320]   I'm selling something, doing something, whatever it is.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.320]   And that $100 a day is more valuable to you
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.520]   than the $100,000 a year job,
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.160]   because the $100 a day comes in without your direct effort.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.600]   The $100 a day comes in no matter where in the world you are
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.320]   and now with that $100 a day,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.120]   you can achieve your first level of financial freedom.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.120]   That's the type of game you can play with income
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.500]   that's really powerful, really effective,
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.040]   and it'll change your behavior.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.120]   Your behavior is gonna be, how do I build the business?
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.240]   How do I automate the business, et cetera?
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.760]   Make up your own games.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.440]   I think there are other percentages
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.100]   or something that I think a lot about.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.600]   For example, a game I always used to recommend to clients.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.520]   When you make a raise, save half, spend half.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   Save half, spend half.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.880]   It's simple, it's intuitive, and it's a game.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.720]   Anytime you get a raise in income,
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.200]   before you get the first paycheck,
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.120]   set up a new automatic transfer of half of the raise,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.720]   half of the increased paycheck
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.640]   to your most important savings goal.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.920]   Or simply with levels of expenses.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.560]   How do you do it with levels of expenses?
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.820]   Really good one is save half.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.840]   If you always save half of your expenses
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.360]   and set that to be the goal,
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.400]   then if you wanna increase your lifestyle
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.560]   and spend more money to have other luxury things
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.160]   that you care about, well, you can do it.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.880]   It's not like you have to save everything
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.060]   of the increased money.
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.960]   Just always save half and spend half.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.800]   And you'll automatically achieve your goal
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.320]   of financial independence while also simultaneously
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.340]   automatically achieving your goal
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.820]   of luxury lifestyle and luxury living.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.240]   Those are some ideas to get you started.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.400]   The most important game is gonna be the game
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.460]   that makes sense to you.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.320]   So whether it's putting a big glass jar on your desk
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.640]   and putting a dollar in it every single day
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.960]   into your financial freedom jar,
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.920]   whether it's paying a dollar and 11 cents every day
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.840]   on your credit card debt,
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.360]   whether it's setting a goal to earn a dollar a day
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.000]   in a way that doesn't require the hourly wage
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.160]   of your effort, in a way that is sustainable,
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.760]   that grows over time,
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.360]   your goals are the ones that are gonna matter.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.080]   But if there's something that's motivating to you
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:59.080]   and you can connect it to a behavior modification,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.520]   don't let anyone tell you it's dumb.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:07.440]   It's hard for me to, in public,
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.240]   talk about making a dollar and 11 transfer to a credit card
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.560]   'cause I concede it's dumb.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.840]   It's a dollar 11.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.680]   But you know what?
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.800]   It works.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.440]   Has worked again and again and again.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.200]   Every time I've needed it, it's always been there.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.960]   It's brought confidence.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.400]   It's hard for me to talk about,
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.800]   it's gonna be hard for you to talk about
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.040]   the things that are silly.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.280]   But whatever your game is,
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.240]   if it's pulling the $5 bills out of your wallet
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.640]   and saving them up for vacation, do it.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.800]   Do the thing that changes your behavior
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.320]   because if you can change your behavior,
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.920]   you change your outcomes in the fullness of time.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.760]   Those are my ideas.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.160]   I hope that you have enjoyed them.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.560]   As I close, I will give you an ad for my credit card course.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.920]   I have a course called How to Borrow Money Safely
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.320]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:59.040]   This course was created because I observed
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   a not very helpful argument in the personal finance space
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.160]   where generally people in personal finance
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.840]   are pitted between two camps,
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.760]   either the maximized debt and maximized points
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.880]   or we don't use credit cards whatsoever.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.120]   I don't have a beef with either of those positions.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.480]   Frankly, I think for most people,
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   if they just never use credit cards,
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.120]   they'd probably be better off.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.240]   But the percentage of those of us who actually do that
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.640]   is very, very small.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.560]   And I think there are huge benefits
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.520]   that credit cards specifically provide.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.680]   And credit card lending, if understood how it works
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.560]   and exercised properly and carefully,
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:45.160]   provides for Americans and I think Canadians and Europeans,
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.200]   although I don't know how much my ideas translate
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.800]   into those economies,
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.680]   but credit cards provide the safest,
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   most secure, lowest cost form of financing that exists.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.280]   Now, whether you use it or not, that's up to you.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.120]   But I do think it's silly not to have it as a backup plan.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.080]   And I can list out as I do in the course,
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.600]   example after example.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.840]   And it seems like a paradox.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.240]   I don't like being in debt.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.040]   I'll tell you what, I can tell you a bunch of times
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.440]   where I would go into debt, have been there, done that.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.680]   I'd do it again if it meant a certain level of results.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.400]   But to do it well and to do it right
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.320]   requires you to put in preparation
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.840]   long before you ever need it.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.000]   A couple of days ago, I was working with a family
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.920]   who went through bankruptcy.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.760]   And the details aren't important,
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.840]   but the point was that although they went through bankruptcy,
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:47.480]   they had to, in order to escape a very dangerous situation,
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.120]   they needed money.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.720]   And the ability to access money using credit cards
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.360]   allowed them to escape a very dangerous situation
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.880]   so that they could keep their family intact
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.260]   so that they could then put things back together,
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.360]   satisfy their creditors, and solve the problems.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.280]   But to do it well, you need to be prepared years in advance.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.240]   Because the worst time to ever get a credit card
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.600]   is when you need one.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.320]   The best time is when you don't need one,
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.680]   don't owe any money, et cetera.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.200]   And you can do the stuff that I talk about in that course.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.240]   If any of that piques your interest,
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.520]   I encourage you to go by radicalpersonalfinance.com/store,
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.680]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/store,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.080]   and sign up for my "How to Borrow Money Safely"
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.640]   and never pay interest using credit cards.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.760]   I have had many, many, many students,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.400]   and thus far, I've only ever had one refund request
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.840]   for that course.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.360]   Some of my other courses haven't gone so well.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.260]   I've had other people who've said, "Ah, Josh, it was okay."
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:48.520]   But with the credit card course, I've only had,
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:52.700]   I'm just thinking, with my financial crisis course
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.000]   and the credit card course,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.440]   I've only had a handful of requests for a refund.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.040]   That tells you something about the quality of it.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.080]   I've had more refund requests
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.760]   for my career and income course.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.920]   I still think it's good,
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.200]   but certainly I've had many more refund requests
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.040]   for that one.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.240]   The credit card course is very, very good.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.360]   And the one refund request I've ever had for it
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.800]   was a guy who said, "Really good,
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.680]   I just already knew all this stuff."
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.440]   So you judge for yourself.
