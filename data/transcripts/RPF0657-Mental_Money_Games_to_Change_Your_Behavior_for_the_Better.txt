[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.240]   Now, the paradox is this. If you can change your thoughts, if you can change your information, if you can change the ideas that you hold in your head, then you can naturally change your behavior a little bit. But it goes the other way, too. Sometimes you can just change your behavior. You can change the ideas. You can change the thoughts. You can change the things that are in your head. You can change your ability to believe in the future. And if you can change your behavior, nothing will actually change.

[00:18:37.540 --> 00:19:05.680]  , and it should go to a separate account that's just for credit card payments.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   That way you make sure that you never ever ever miss a payment because you know that no matter what a minimum payment is going to be paid on every single one of your credit cards.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   So I believe that's a superior strategy than you manually paying credit cards because it's a danger that especially if you have a lot of credit cards and a lot of payments and minimum payments do here and there throughout the month.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   It's just too big of a danger that it would harm your credit score to ever be able to be able to receive the money.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   So I believe that's a separate account that you never ever ever pay that you never ever pay a payment because you never ever pay a payment and never pay a minimum payment is going to receive a minimum payment.

[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.920]   And so the goal is never be late on a single payment.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.520]   You can do it.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.020]   If you're someone who's struggled with being late in the past, you can do it.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.620]   I am in my mid-30s.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:23.220]   I have had credit accounts since I was 18 years old on my 18th birthday and to date.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:31.020]   I have never been a day late on a single payment in my life and that helps massively on your credit score.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.820]   It's one of the most important things.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.820]   Well, it's not that hard to do you just sit down and you analyze the problem and say I can't do this.

[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   I can never be late on a single day.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   If you can never be late on a single date.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:05.660]   I can never be late on a day.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.100]   So that you never miss a payment now with other things.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:10.200]   Now with other things.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.000]   I can never be late on a single day.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.800]   Sometimes generally mortgage companies you have to initiate the check.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.100]   So when there's a debt that's on your credit report, make sure that that gets paid no matter what.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.600]   So when there's a debt that's on your credit report, make sure that that gets paid no matter what.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   So it's good for you to have a standing automatic mortgage payment.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   So it's good for you to have a standing automatic mortgage payment.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:35.300]   But generally if that's your only other debt you can remember that but if you have a car payment or whatever make sure that your bank initiates sending of a check.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   But generally if that's your only other debt you can remember that but if you have a car payment or whatever make sure that your bank initiates sending of a check.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:21:04.940]  ,
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.140]   It's a little safer in any kind of debtor situation for you to keep all the control and use your bank's functionality of sending out a check or sending out a payment then to give your credit or electronic access to your checking account. I concede the argument that it's not perfectly safe to let a credit card company access your checking account on their end automatically. That's not perfectly safe. But I think the benefits outweigh the risk in terms of the benefits of making sure that you can juggle multiple credit cards and never be late on a single date.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:05.140]   But I think the benefits outweigh the risk in terms of the benefits of making sure that you can juggle multiple credit cards and never be late on a single date.
