[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.840]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All the Haps, a show
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.320]   about upgrading your life, money and travel all while spending
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.720]   less and saving more.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.680]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.160]   journey to find all the Haps.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.080]   Okay, you all have amazing questions, and I thought the Q&A
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.200]   episode from a few months ago was so great.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.320]   Well, the questions keep rolling in, and I'm excited to do
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.160]   another episode.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.160]   In fact, there were so many questions that I don't know if
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.520]   I'm going to be able to get to all of them.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.040]   I tried answering a couple of the crypto questions in my
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.760]   episode with Kevin Rose, and I may try to answer some of the
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.600]   money and investing ones with Josal Sihai from Stacking
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.920]   Benjamins in a couple weeks.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.680]   But today, I'm going to tackle all the points, miles, credit
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.000]   card and travel questions.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.040]   That includes using points, comparing cards, managing so
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.880]   many cards, finding the best cards for your spending, rental
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.520]   car hacks and more, including a reversal on how I feel about
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.280]   the new Capital One Venture X card.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   If you have any other questions, please send them in, as I love
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.360]   doing these episodes.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.680]   My email is chris@allthehacks.com, and I would love
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.480]   to help you upgrade your life, too.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.520]   Also, one of the ways I earn money on this show is when you
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.600]   sign up for cards at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600]   That definitely doesn't mean you should go sign up for a card
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.400]   you don't need just to help out, but if you're already going to
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.320]   sign up, I'd love it if you use the link.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.320]   It should have the best sign-up bonuses, but if not, go wherever
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.760]   you can get the best bonus.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.800]   My priority is you earning the most points you can.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.520]   So with that out of the way, let's jump right in.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.640]   All right, so let's start with the Capital One Venture X card.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.880]   In my newsletter about a month ago, I said it wasn't going to
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.560]   be in my wallet, and I was wrong.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's in my wallet right now, and I use it all the time.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   And I want to talk about why.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.120]   So my default "everything else" card, where I don't have a bonus
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.640]   in a category, has always been the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   It earns 1.5 points per dollar, and because I also have the Chase
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.400]   Sapphire Reserve card, those 1.5 points end up being able to be
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   transferred to different airlines and hotels.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.160]   Or, I can use them for 1.5 cents towards travel in the portal.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.200]   So 1.5 cents times 1.5 points per dollar means that it's
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.920]   an effective 2.25% cashback.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.520]   And when I thought about the Venture X card earning two
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.240]   points worth one cent each, I thought, "Well, this isn't better
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.360]   than the Freedom Unlimited, because 2.25 is better than two."
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.520]   And I think it's historically that Capital One points weren't able
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.280]   to be transferred to airlines and hotels that made me think about
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.200]   the comparison on the effective cashback rates.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.280]   However, I totally forgot that you can transfer all these
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.800]   Capital One points to airlines.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.120]   So you're getting two transferable points per dollar on the Venture
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.600]   X, and only one and a half on the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.880]   So, apologies for that oversight.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.840]   If you're in the game of transferring points to airlines, which is how
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.000]   I use most of my points, the Capital One Venture X is going to earn
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.440]   33% more points on everyday purchases than the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.360]   So I signed up and I got the huge 100,000 point signup bonus they
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.520]   have right now, which does require spending $10,000 over the next six
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.560]   months, but the Points Guy values Capital One points at 1.85 cents per
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.080]   point, so that means your signup bonus is worth almost $2,000.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.120]   And yes, the card does have a $395 annual fee, but you get a $300
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.600]   travel credit each year, you get a free Priority Pass membership
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.720]   for lounge access, you get a $200 credit on vacation rentals your
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.480]   first year, and 10,000 bonus points each year after that.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.000]   But even without all that, you're still getting two points per dollar
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.040]   that transfer to over a dozen airlines.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.440]   So I think this is a fantastic card.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.760]   It'll probably be in my wallet for a while, at least until there's
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.240]   some new crazy offer or new amazing card.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   I liked it so much, my wife actually signed up for it also.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.120]   So now we have two in the house.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.360]   And yes, that means paying two annual fees.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.960]   I'll get to that in the next question.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.560]   But that means over the next six months, we'll have racked up over
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.400]   240,000 Capital One points if you include the $10,000 we each have
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.960]   to spend to get the signup bonus.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.000]   So if you're interested in the card, I'd love it if you use
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.840]   my referral link to sign up.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.960]   It's allthehacks.com/VentureX.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.440]   This is a different link than my normal allthehacks.com/cards link.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.240]   And that's because the /cards link right now actually earns
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.480]   nothing for the VentureX signup.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.720]   So /VentureX is actually my personal referral link.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.920]   So after you get the card, you should start using your own referral
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.400]   link to tell your friends about it.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.000]   They'll earn 100,000 points and you can earn some bonus points too.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.720]   That's also a great segue to our first listener question from Jenny about
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.760]   why the Venture cards from Capital One aren't a top pick.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.720]   As you can see, things are changing, but the primary reason I still don't
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.480]   put them at the top of the list is that they don't offer any big
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.080]   category bonuses on earning.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.600]   So you can get a whole lot more points on things like travel, dining,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.440]   and groceries with other cards.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.120]   That said, I do think the Venture and VentureX cards are good kind of
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.760]   everything else cards now that you can transfer their points to airlines.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.240]   And I will definitely be using them in 2022.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.280]   So Sean wrote in with a great question.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.440]   He's repeatedly heard from people who travel for free having 25 or 30 cards
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.480]   that they track across lots of spreadsheets and wanted to know if they
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.560]   all pay annual fees on all these cards or do they cancel the cards and is it
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.480]   all worth it and what about the credit hits that they have and do they even
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.800]   close cards and reopen the same ones later?
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.400]   So while I've probably opened maybe 25 or 30 cards in my entire life, I
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.800]   probably have about a dozen right now, but when it comes to opening all these
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.240]   cards in the first place, I think sometimes the calculus is very different
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.440]   the first year than it is for ongoing years.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.840]   So in the first year, you might get a signup bonus worth a thousand, even $2,000.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.400]   And so it might make sense to open up that card, meet the minimum spend
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.240]   requirements, collect the points and reevaluate after one year.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.320]   And at that one year point, when I get that second annual fee, which you usually
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.560]   have some time to be able to go back to the issuer and say, please, actually, I
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.160]   don't want to renew this card and get that annual fee refunded, I decide if
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.760]   it's worth it on an ongoing basis.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.360]   And sometimes it is because you might be getting in the case of a Marriott Bonvoy
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.720]   Amex, you might be getting a free night's day every year and an annual fee is $95.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.960]   So if the perks make it worth the annual fee, you might keep it.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.920]   Or if you spend enough money that the incremental miles or points that you get
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.880]   from your spend on that card is worth it, then that's another good reason.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.160]   So let's take an example of someone who has a Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.600]   and a Chase Freedom Unlimited.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.680]   So they're already getting three points per dollar on travel and dining, and they
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.040]   get one and a half points on everything else.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.560]   Let's say they opened up an Amex Gold to get a big signup bonus, and they're
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.280]   deciding whether they keep it or not.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.840]   Well, with the Amex Gold, they're getting four points per
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.240]   dollar on dining and groceries.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.600]   So that's an extra one point per dollar on dining over the Chase Reserve and an
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.320]   extra 2.5 points per dollar over the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.040]   So do they spend enough money each year that one extra point per dollar on
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.240]   dining and two and a half points per dollar on groceries makes up for the
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.920]   annual fee?
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.200]   Well, the Amex Gold is $250 per year, but you get $10 a month for Uber
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.920]   and $10 per month for Grubhub.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.480]   Now, if you're really efficient, you could get $240 of value out of that and
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.320]   make the effective annual fee $10.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.000]   But let's say we're only able to get $100 of value here because it's hard to
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.240]   remember to order out from two different places every single month.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.280]   That means the effective annual fee is $150.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.640]   Now, I always use the Points Guys valuations, which I'll link to in the
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.600]   show notes, but they say Amex points are worth two cents.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.360]   So $150 divided by 0.02 is 7,500 points.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.080]   So with an extra two and a half points on groceries and one point on dining,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.240]   will they earn 7,500 points?
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.920]   Let's say you assume a 50/50 split on groceries and dining spending, then that
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.280]   means they have to spend about $4,300 per year on dining and groceries
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.880]   for it to be worth it to keep the card.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.000]   So if that makes sense, great.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.880]   But another consideration is whether you need to keep the
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.760]   card open to not lose the points.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.600]   And if you're in a situation where you have 150,000 Amex points, but the
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.520]   card is your only Amex, you might want to keep it just to make
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.760]   sure you don't lose the points.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.480]   Capital One and Chase have ways that you could transfer points
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.920]   to your spouse, but Amex doesn't.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.520]   So if I've ultimately decided a card isn't worth it and I want to cancel it,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.680]   I first call the issuer and let them know that given the annual fee and
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.520]   the benefits, the card just isn't worth it and I want to cancel it.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.960]   And sometimes I've been offered bonus points, waived annual fees, and
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.480]   other perks to keep the card open.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.760]   So I might do that.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.480]   Other times I get nothing and I just cancel the card.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.160]   The only exception to that is when I've had a card for a really long time,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.360]   I ask the issuer if there's a free card I can downgrade to.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.200]   That way I keep the really long history of that card on my credit history
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.960]   to balance out the average length of credit history, which
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.120]   helps with your credit score.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.000]   Another pro tip, if you have a few different cards with an issuer like
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Chase, you can actually ask Chase to move credit between them.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   So if you're going to cancel a card, you could move all but $1,000 of that
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.560]   card's credit limit to another card and then cancel it.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.840]   So to summarize and to make sure I hit all of Sean's questions, yes, I pay
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.480]   all the annual fees, but in the first year, the signup bonus almost
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.560]   always makes it worth it.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.600]   After that, I only pay for annual fees in subsequent years when
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.040]   the benefits exceed the fee.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.520]   The value's not there, I cancel the card or downgrade it.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.400]   And finally, yes, it's absolutely worth it for me because I love
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.600]   traveling the world for free.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.640]   All right.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.280]   So up next, Dick and Willie, I'm not making this up folks, both
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.000]   had questions about using points.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.480]   Dick asked if I could recommend a company to help people use points
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.640]   more efficiently, he has almost half a million points and wants to
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.200]   get way more value than the portal.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.640]   And Willie wants to plan some trips to Mexico and Hawaii and
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.080]   wants the best deals as well.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.600]   So this is a big topic and I'm even thinking of writing a
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.760]   whole guide to help out.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.000]   But until I do, here's my thoughts.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.600]   Dick is correct that you get a much better value transferring
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.080]   points than booking in the portal.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.400]   Sometimes it might be 10 or 15% better and sometimes it might even be worse.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.680]   But other times it can be three or four times better or more.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.120]   For example, a colleague of mine last week was looking to book a nice hotel in
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.160]   Cabo for a three-day weekend next March.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.720]   All of the five-star hotels were over a thousand dollars a night.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.000]   And the one he really had his eye on, the Cape, which is an incredible hotel,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.600]   was $1,600 per night after taxes.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.960]   So booking in the Chase portal would have been about a hundred thousand
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.520]   points per night because he had the reserve and he got 1.5 cents per point.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.200]   Well, since the Cape is a Hyatt property, he was able to transfer
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.320]   his Chase points directly to Hyatt and book for just 25,000 points per night.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.520]   So he got three nights for 75,000 points, which would have otherwise
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.800]   cost him either $4,800 in cash or 320,000 points in the portal.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.560]   He got a value of 6.4 cents per point, which is amazing.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.880]   And in the last Q&A, I mentioned my neighbor who booked four business class
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.160]   tickets to Europe that would have cost him about 20 or $22,000, almost a
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.480]   million and a half points in the portal for just 440,000 points by transferring
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.440]   them to Air France and booking with Air France Miles, he got a value
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.160]   of almost 5 cents per point.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.320]   So why isn't this easy?
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.520]   Well, sometimes it is.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.120]   Sometimes you can just go to look at the airline transfer partner's websites,
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.320]   look for flights quickly, and you might just see a great deal for
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.760]   the exact times you want to fly.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.440]   And if that's the case, just transfer the points and book it.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.200]   The challenge is that Chase, Amex, Capital One, each have over a dozen
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.520]   transfer partners, so that can be a lot of searching, and one of the
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.280]   keys is to be flexible on dates.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   So each time you search, you might search for different dates
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.600]   and it can take a long time.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.520]   One option is to pay for Point.me, which is a search engine, kind of like
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.760]   Google flights, but just for award availability across all the transfer
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.960]   partners of different points programs like Chase or Amex.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.640]   It costs $95 a year or $15 for five days, but it will save you so much time.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.560]   I've had a ton of success with it, and a few readers have even written in
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.320]   saying they've had great success too.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.280]   If all that seems like too much work, then you could just use an award
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.720]   booking service and they'll take care of everything for you.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.680]   Point.me calls it their concierge service.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.000]   I've heard great things about it.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.080]   The points guy mentioned Points Pros in our interview, but there's dozens
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.960]   of services out there and they all end up costing a few hundred dollars per person.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.720]   Now, oftentimes that's contingent on finding something, so you
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.240]   aren't committed to spend it all.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.840]   And while that might seem like a lot, in the case of my neighbor, in the
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.160]   case of the trip my neighbor took, if he had spent $800 for a family of
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:05.000]   four to get $22,000 of flights for just 440,000 chase points, it
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.200]   would have been totally worth it.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.560]   So hopefully that helps.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.880]   Of course, I always suggest starting to look at a few of the most obvious
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.160]   transfer partners first and comparing the number of miles you need to use
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.040]   on their website with the number of points you'd need to book in the
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.600]   portal to see if you can find a deal.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.400]   In my opinion, anything over 2 cents per point is good.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.640]   Anything over 3 cents is fantastic.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.320]   And if you're regularly getting 5 or more cents per point, let me know,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.560]   because you should probably be doing these episodes instead of me.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.760]   So when it comes to hotels, it's all a little bit easier.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.160]   The only time I've ever transferred points to a hotel
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.280]   program is from Chase to Hyatt.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.120]   Every other deal from Amex, from Capital One, I don't think is worth it.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.720]   So if the place you're trying to stay isn't a Hyatt property, then you
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.640]   don't even have to worry about trying to use your points unless you're
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.720]   trying to book through the portal.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.720]   Hey everybody.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.840]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me, my
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.480]   favorite award search tool, to give you a special offer of only $1 for your
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:09.200]   first month of their standard plan if you go to allthehacks.com/pointme
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.160]   and use the promo code HACKS.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:18.600]   Again, allthehacks.com/P-O-I-N-T-M-E or find the link in the show notes.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.960]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with points.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.760]   So Sue wrote in with another booking with points questions.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.880]   She wants to take her bucket list trip to Italy next year with her two kids and wants
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.480]   to make sure she has enough points to do it.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.360]   Specifically, she asked whether 300,000 points is enough for
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.760]   four people to get to Europe.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.880]   And while she already has some Amex points, she wants to know if it's
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.680]   better to focus on Amex or Chase and whether signup bonuses should be
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.040]   the way to boost their balance.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.000]   This will also get at Emilio's question about issues with having points spread
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.840]   out across too many card programs.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.200]   First off, these are great questions.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.280]   I'll start by saying if you're okay flying in coach, then 300,000 points
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.600]   should be enough, but if you want to do business, you're going to be short.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.200]   Now let's assume she's going to be short and needs to close the gap.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.440]   In general, I don't think it makes much sense to start trying to earn points in
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.920]   multiple programs until you have enough points in one program to cover everyone.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.080]   And that's because they don't all have the same transfer partners.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.760]   For example, if you find a flight on Lufthansa, you could book it with Amex
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.640]   points by transferring to Air Canada, or you could book with Chase
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.080]   points by transferring to United.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.280]   But you can't transfer to the same place, so you'd have to end up
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.000]   booking part of the trip separately.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.880]   Now, when you pay for flights, or even when you book in the portal, booking
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.600]   two one-ways is often more expensive than booking a round trip.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.200]   However, one of the best things about booking directly with airlines after
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.960]   you transfer points to them is that it's easy to book one way.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.280]   So if you had enough Amex points to book your flight to Europe, you could focus
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.840]   on collecting Chase points to book your return.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.320]   So the exact plan might be different for each person, but either way, I do think
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   that sign-up bonuses are going to be your best bet for closing the gap, and you can
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.120]   find the top sign-up bonuses right now at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.360]   So Don wrote in with a question about booking in the portal.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.000]   He pointed out that so many cards are giving big bonuses
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.520]   when you book in their portal.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.000]   For example, the Chase Reserve earns 10x on hotels and 5x on flights
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.440]   for paid bookings in the portal.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.680]   Now, that's when you're not using points.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.880]   He wanted to know when that makes sense.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.560]   So this is a tough one because there's no clear answer.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.480]   When you book directly with the airlines and hotels, you might earn less points,
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.480]   but it is so much easier if things go wrong or need to be changed.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.160]   And like I've shared in the past, your odds of getting an upgrade by reaching
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.360]   out to the hotel is infinitely better when you book direct.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.880]   When you book with the portals, you often have to make all your changes and
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.080]   cancellations through the portal, which can be more difficult.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.880]   For me, I already earned 5x on flights booked directly with
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.840]   airlines through the Amex Platinum, so I've never actually thought
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.440]   about booking flights on the portal.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.280]   And even if I'm just getting an additional 2 points per dollar over
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.800]   the Reserve's 3x on travel, it'd have to be really, really
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.200]   expensive for me to do it.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.320]   On hotels, I guess if the cancellation policy was reasonable and the deal
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.880]   was comparable or better, I'd probably go for it because I couldn't earn
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.560]   anywhere close to 10x points booking elsewhere.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.200]   That said, assume you're definitely not getting that upgrade or any special
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.880]   treatment when you check in, but it's probably worth it for all the extra points.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.400]   Finally, if you have a card like the Capital One Venture X, where your travel
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.360]   credit is tied to booking in the portal, then I'd definitely book in the portal
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.240]   at least enough to earn my full credit.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.680]   Now, Jessica had an important follow-up to this.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.440]   She asked if the prices are the same in the portal as they are elsewhere online.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.960]   And they usually are, but it's always worth double-checking quick because I
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.080]   definitely wouldn't want to pay extra to get a few more points.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.360]   And there is one other interesting thing.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.920]   Not all flights and hotels are in the portal.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.800]   So if you have your heart set on a specific flight, you just might not be
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.280]   able to buy it in the portal, and that's just how it works.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.400]   I've tried searching weird, different ways, and I could never get
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.000]   some of certain flights to show up.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.600]   And you can find the top signup bonuses right now at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.840]   Now, I also got a few questions about direct card comparisons.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.760]   Steven has the Chase Freedom and has had it for a while and wanted to know about
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.040]   switching to the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.240]   Now, I've had both of those cards for the past two or three years, and I
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.320]   use the Freedom Unlimited almost 10 times more than the Freedom.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.280]   For those of you who don't know, the Freedom is a card that earns 5x points
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.080]   per dollar on a different category each quarter, and since you never know what
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.120]   it's going to be, it's really hard to make any plans.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.080]   There have been multiple quarters in a row where the card's been totally useless.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.040]   And then Q4 this year has been PayPal, which I've been able to max out.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.560]   So as a compliment to the Sapphire Preferred or Reserve, I've always
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.720]   thought the Unlimited was the best second card.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.200]   Now, that gets a little more complicated for me personally, because now I have
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.840]   the Capital One Venture X, and it's going to be my new everyday spending card.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.000]   So I imagine the Unlimited is really only going to be a card I use for drug
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.720]   stores where it earns more points than any other card, which actually means
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.520]   the Freedom will get a lot more usage than the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.360]   But for most people who aren't trying to spread their points over lots of
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.960]   different programs and have lots of different cards, I think the combo of
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.360]   a Sapphire Preferred or Reserve and the Freedom Unlimited is a better
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.520]   combo than pairing it with the Freedom.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.480]   Now, Jessica had another question.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.240]   She wanted my thoughts on comparing the Sapphire Reserve and the Amex Platinum,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.920]   asking which one comes out ahead.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.320]   Now on the surface, they're both premium travel cards with lounge access, but I
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.120]   actually think this one's a much easier question.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.520]   The only money I really ever put on my Platinum card is Airfare for the 5x points.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.440]   It only earns one point per dollar on everything else, and I really view the
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.920]   Platinum much more as a perks card, with the primary benefit being getting
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.480]   access to the Centurion Lounge.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.640]   And while the annual fee is high, I think if you use the credits they offer, it
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.520]   can come close to netting out to zero.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.280]   The same thing is true on the Sapphire Reserve in terms of cutting the annual
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:09.040]   fee down, but you earn bonuses on travel and dining, which is a large
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.880]   portion of my spend, so I think that one's a much easier decision, and I
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.480]   think the Sapphire Reserve, for most people, comes out ahead.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.440]   I hope that helps you both pick your next card.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.080]   All right, so both Sherelle and Scott had questions about having multiple
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.960]   Chase Sapphire cards, and in both scenarios, they had the Chase Sapphire
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.880]   Preferred and wanted to get the Reserve.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.120]   The issue is, you can't have multiple Chase Sapphire cards.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.560]   So my wife and I were in this exact situation, and here's what we did.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.200]   We didn't want to lose our points, so we didn't want to just close out our
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.120]   Preferred cards, so we each downgraded them to no annual fee cards.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.960]   I went to the Freedom Unlimited, and she went to the Freedom.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.320]   Then, after that was official, we waited a few weeks, though, if you want to play
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.960]   it safe, you should probably wait 30 days, and we applied for the Reserve.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.360]   But there's one other important requirement.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.280]   It has to have been 48 months or 4 years from the last Sapphire bonus.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.920]   In our case, we had opened the Preferred more than 4 years ago, so it wasn't an
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   issue, but if the statement closing date, when you got the sign-up bonus from
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.120]   whichever Sapphire card you opened already was in the last 4 years,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.280]   then you're going to have to wait.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.160]   There is another option.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.560]   You can always upgrade or downgrade from one Sapphire card to the other, but you
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.160]   won't get a sign-up bonus when you do it.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.080]   So if you really want the Chase Reserve card, you could upgrade your Preferred,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.520]   but you'll miss out on that opportunity to get those bonus points, and hopefully
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.760]   that helps you figure out what to do.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.040]   Okay, this is a fun one because I've gone through it myself.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.520]   David wrote in saying he got married last year, but he and his wife Casey still have
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.000]   their individual credit cards, including 2 Chase Sapphire Reserves.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.080]   He wanted to know if there was a way to benefit from a rewards perspective by
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.200]   consolidating, or if he should keep them separate.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.480]   First off, congrats to David and Casey.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.800]   This is a great question.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.760]   So you're probably right that it doesn't make sense to be paying 2
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.280]   annual fees for the Reserve card.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.880]   But before you do anything, you'll want to make sure you're
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.000]   not going to lose any points.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.040]   The good news is that Chase will let you transfer Ultimate Rewards points
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.720]   between members of your household for free.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.360]   Sometimes it doesn't work to link the accounts online, so you might have to
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.040]   call, but it's definitely possible and allowed.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.120]   So before you cancel any cards, just make sure you move the
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.440]   points around so you don't lose them.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   Okay, so the obvious answer would be for one of you to cancel your Reserve and get
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.640]   added as an authorized user to the other one's card.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.040]   That's not a bad option, but the downside is that you only have a joint account,
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.240]   which can be frustrating for some couples, and it also means that the other person
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   will lose their card from their credit history.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.440]   Now, you could downgrade the card to a good no-annual-fee card like the
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.000]   Freedom Flex or Freedom Unlimited.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.440]   But unless that cardholder has a Sapphire card also, you don't actually
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.240]   earn Ultimate Rewards points, so you aren't able to use your
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.760]   points to transfer to airlines.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.560]   So I'll throw out another option.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.000]   One of you could downgrade to the Sapphire Preferred.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.840]   You'd still earn 3x on Dining like the Reserve, but you'd only earn 2x on Travel.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.680]   However, most Travel purchases are booked online, so you could still use the other
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.680]   person's Reserve card to book Travel and earn 3x points.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.560]   This way, you both have separate cards, and you probably won't lose out on that
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.200]   many points, and you both keep your credit history.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   Technically, it's $20 more because the Preferred costs $95 a year and an
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.920]   authorized cardholder on the Reserve is $75, but both are going to be
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.480]   cheaper than two Reserve cards.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.960]   Another couple downsides to know about.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.880]   The Preferred doesn't get you free TSA Pre or Global Entry, though I would say
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.400]   use that credit before you get rid of your Reserve and it's good for 5 years.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.200]   And it doesn't get Priority Pass for Lounge Access.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.040]   But the Reserve's Priority Pass allows for two free guests, so it's really only
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.920]   an issue when one of you is traveling alone.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.800]   Okay, if you want the next-level hack version, and it's been 4 years since
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.240]   you've opened your Reserve card, you could actually just downgrade your
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.560]   Reserve to a free card, like the Freedom Unlimited, and then open a new
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.720]   Sapphire Preferred and get the sign-up bonus on that card.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.280]   Hopefully that helps.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.360]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.240]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place,
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.880]   and makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.640]   bonuses on every purchase.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.120]   You can also load it on your partner's phone, so they always
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.680]   know the best cards to use.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.800]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.480]   credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.400]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of America,
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.880]   or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.160]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.800]   Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.760]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.120]   without having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.600]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.520]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:15.920]   will, you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.960]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.760]   Getting the crew together, isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.480]   I get it.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.760]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.080]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.120]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.000]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.560]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.600]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.440]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.520]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.360]   you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.240]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.600]   your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.920]   houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.400]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.080]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.000]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.080]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.000]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.360]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.000]   Okay, changing gears a bit, I want to move over to business credit cards.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.520]   Not just because they have some of the best signup bonuses out there, but
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.920]   because Braxton wrote in asking about the best cards for his newly formed LLC.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.080]   Well, the first thing to know is that you don't actually need any official
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.360]   business registration or entity number to get a business credit card.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.280]   In fact, your personal credit is tied to most business credit cards.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.240]   That means you can definitely sign up for a business card if you want to take
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.560]   advantage of some of these big signup bonuses.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.920]   If you want some tips, I'll link to a few articles in the show notes.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.680]   As for which cards, I'll point out a few things.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.520]   First off, you don't actually need to use a business card for business expenses.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.160]   It definitely might help you for keeping organized and tracking things.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.120]   But even when I ran my own business, I put all my flights on my personal
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.000]   Platinum Amex because it earned 5x on airfare.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.200]   That said, there are a few business cards I think are a great place to start.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.600]   I personally really like the Ink Business Preferred the most.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.720]   It has 3x on travel, shipping, internet cable and phone
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.080]   services, and online advertising.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.920]   It also pairs nicely with the Ink Business Unlimited, which earns
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.720]   1.5 points on everything.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.240]   And if you have the Sapphire Preferred or Reserve, you can link up all your
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.840]   personal and business cards, combine ultimate rewards balances, and transfer
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.720]   any and all of those points to airline and hotel partners.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.800]   And best of all, the Ink Business Preferred has a massive 100,000 Chase
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.560]   Point signup bonus right now that you can get at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.000]   On the Amex side, I used to have the Business Gold, which has a really cool
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.400]   feature, it earns 4 points per dollar on whatever two categories you spend the
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.640]   most on each month from a list of six categories, which are airfare,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.440]   advertising, computer hardware and software, gas, restaurants, and shipping.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.840]   One thing to note is that while your personal credit is needed to open a
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.480]   business card, some issuers like Chase don't actually report the
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.080]   card to personal credit bureaus.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.720]   Okay, so Cody wrote in saying he listened to the episode about credit card
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.440]   points and wanted to know what to do to earn the most points for gas.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.800]   He does a lot of driving for work and wanted to get the best card.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.760]   So the Citi Premier earns 3x points on gas, and the points guy values him at
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.840]   1.7 cents, so that's about 5.1% cash back on gas.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.360]   It's also a good card that gets 3x on air travel, hotels, supermarkets, and
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.120]   restaurants, and has over a dozen transfer partners.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.880]   Now, it does have a $95 annual fee, but you get a $100 hotel credit on a $500 or
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   more hotel stay, and there's an 80,000-point signup bonus at
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.440]   allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.760]   So that's one option.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.280]   Another one is the Blue Cash Preferred, which gets just 3% cash back on gas.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   The Costco card gets 4% back, but only on the first $7,000.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.600]   And there's also a link I'll put to Doctor of Credit's website that has an
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.080]   updated list of the best gas credit cards.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.440]   I love this next question from Siddharsan.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.240]   He said, "I have a lot of cards, and I couldn't find an app to figure out what
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.320]   the best cash back is for a retailer."
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.920]   He pointed out there used to be this app called Wallaby, but it doesn't exist
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.360]   anymore.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.080]   So I think there's two apps worth checking out here.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.200]   This is a quick answer.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.560]   The new Points Guy app has a feature exactly for this.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.520]   You load in all your cards, and you can actually pick a retailer, but it only
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.720]   works by picking something that's in your vicinity with your location on, and it
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.920]   only works on iOS.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.800]   There's another app that I just tried out that I really like called Card
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.440]   Pointers.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.560]   Now, you can't say a specific retailer, but once you load in all of your cards,
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.840]   you can go through each category, and it really simply breaks out the best card in
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.160]   your arsenal for each one.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.640]   Now, I had to go in and manually override a few of the categories, so it's not
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.520]   perfect, but if I were trying to find an app to do this, those are the two apps I
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.080]   would check out.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   So while we're talking about having all of these points and miles and different
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.880]   accounts, Alex had a great question.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.120]   He said I referenced a spreadsheet that I use to track all my rewards and points
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.280]   for all of my cards and asked if I could share my template.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.840]   So first off, yes.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   If you want to check out the template, it's allthehacks.com/pointstracker.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.280]   However, I will say that it's a completely manual template that's all
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.240]   tracked in a Google Sheet.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.560]   And while it's fun for me to do sometimes, I'm really excited about what the Points
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.640]   Guy launched with their new app, and I'm really hoping that that can replace this
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.080]   for me.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.320]   Maybe it won't, maybe it'll take some time, but I would love to move off of
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.480]   this spreadsheet in the future.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.240]   Hopefully, the whole spreadsheet makes sense.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.200]   There's a row for all the different programs.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.600]   There's columns for different people in your household.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.520]   I even use the Points Guy's points valuations at one point so that I can
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.040]   track the value of everything.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.160]   I also use colors and notes in the spreadsheet to be able to point out when
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.840]   things expire and whether I need to act on it soon.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.600]   But hopefully, this is helpful.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.480]   I just can't wait till someone can build something that actually works to
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.360]   automate all of this.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.640]   Now, this next question might be familiar for a lot of you that live in a
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.040]   hub for one airline.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.360]   Andrew wrote in for Minneapolis, a major Delta hub, and his primary airline.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.000]   He pointed out that while Amex points can transfer to Delta, he feels like he
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.520]   can't take advantage of some of the other exciting cards and sign-up bonuses he
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:49.920]   sees.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.680]   Now, I know a lot of people in a similar situation, and they feel like they've
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.800]   committed to one carrier for all their travel.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.040]   In fact, I've lived most of my entire life near DC, Denver, and San Francisco,
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.520]   which are all United hubs.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.200]   So you probably accrue a lot of points on your home airline, and if you're just
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.720]   looking for a card that helps you top up that bonus, then you need to get a card
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.480]   that supports that.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.880]   Delta has Amex, United has Chase, Citi has American.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.320]   However, if it's really more about the status you have on that airline, then it
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.840]   doesn't really matter because that status will apply across all the airline's
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.520]   partners.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.400]   So if you have Delta Platinum status, but you have Chase points, you can always
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.800]   transfer them to another SkyTeam partner like Air France and book with their miles
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.200]   and still benefit from your status across the whole alliance.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.920]   For me, I'm actually always trying to use my miles for international business, so
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.720]   whether I have status on United or not doesn't matter because when you book in
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.040]   business class, you already get priority boarding, faster security, and free check
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:49.560]   bags.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:55.760]   So we talked so much about using points to fly internationally, but Jennifer asked
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.520]   if there are ever any deals for business class flights or whether the only way to
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.480]   do it is points.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.920]   Well, the best place I've found to find all the deals for business and first
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.360]   class flights is the Premium Fare Deals Forum on Flyertalk, which I'll link to in
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.080]   the show notes.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.000]   I'm looking at it now, and while it's a little tough to filter by your home
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.120]   airport, I'm seeing some crazy business class deals like SF to Madrid for $1,800
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.240]   and LA to Lima in Peru for $850.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.280]   I've also seen some good deals by following The Points Guy or The Flight
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.320]   Deal on Twitter, but it doesn't happen that often.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.200]   You can also just search with no destination on Google Flights and switch to
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.440]   business class and see what might exist.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.880]   For example, I'm looking right now in the spring for business class flights under
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:51.600]   $3,000, and you can go to Berlin, Rome, Istanbul, Cairo, and so many other places.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.720]   Two other sites I've found, but I can't endorse because I've never tried them,
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.000]   but they could be worth checking out are First Class Flyer.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.520]   It's a paid subscription, but it looks like they've got a 14-day trial for $1.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.360]   And Mighty Travels also has a paid newsletter that I haven't tried, but it
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.480]   seems to focus on premium cabins and lets you specify your home airport.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.200]   Hopefully that helps, but again, I do think that the cheapest way to travel
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.640]   internationally is to start hacking the game with points and miles.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.280]   All right.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.880]   So this isn't just going to be about flights and hotels.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.600]   Rick emailed in asking for rental car hacks, and I have a few I'd love to share.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.920]   So I'll start out when you're searching for a car.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.000]   You can use an aggregator like Kayak to find the lowest prices, but oftentimes
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.920]   the discount codes get the best rates, and you can only put those in on
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.680]   the rental car company websites.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.400]   You'd be surprised to find that you might have access to way more rental
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.680]   car discounts than you know.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.040]   For example, many big employers have great rates.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.640]   I know I did at Google, but I also find great prices with
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.120]   Avis using the Costco discount.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.400]   My business fraternity from college somehow offers a really good rate at
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.760]   Enterprise, and other organizations like AAA or USAA have discounts as well.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.400]   That means that you have to go to a few rental car websites to search around,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.640]   but I've seen rates drop in half using these discounts.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.960]   Also, many premium travel cards like the Platinum or the Chase Reserve come with
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.240]   a status on various rental car companies, so that can save you money.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.440]   And if you want to splurge on an Audi with Silver Car, which has been a
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.080]   fantastic experience every time I've done it, Visa Infinite cards
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.520]   like the Chase Reserve get 30% off.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:40.400]   Now, if you're looking at an airport and everything is expensive, you might
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.280]   want to look to rent downtown in the city you're flying into to save money,
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.720]   and then just take an Uber or a Lyft to get there.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.680]   You could also check out sites like Turo, which is like Airbnb for rental cars.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.400]   I know a lot of people have had success there, but I personally hate having
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.440]   to coordinate with another person after a long flight, and I just prefer
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.800]   grabbing something at the airport.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.760]   During your reservation, if you get the option to save money by pre-paying
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.880]   for your rental car, here's how I think about it.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.560]   Because rental car prices fluctuate so much, if I'm booking far in
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.480]   advance and the rate is high, I usually won't pre-pay, so I can check back
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.320]   in every few weeks or months to see if the rates have dropped.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.720]   If so, I just rebook and cancel the reservation.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:29.760]   But if I'm closer to travel and the risk of canceling the trip is really low, if
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.520]   the discount's big enough, I'll take it.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.800]   Also, sometimes rates for a full week are significantly cheaper.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.440]   So even if you only need the car for five or six days, it might be
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.080]   cheaper to book for a whole week.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.080]   Also, you pay for rental cars on 24-hour periods, so on the off-chance you need
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.280]   a car for a few hours more than some multiple of 24, you're going to have to
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.800]   pay for a full day for that extra hour or two.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.680]   However, if you read the fine print, some companies give you an
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.600]   hour or two for free if you're late.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.680]   So if I needed a car from 10am one day to 11am another day, I'll actually
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.400]   book it from 10am to 10am and just drop it off an hour late for
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.080]   free and not pay the extra day.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.560]   Now, before you book, I definitely recommend joining the loyalty
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.000]   program of the rental car company.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.120]   Even the free tier often means you can pick up your car without having
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.880]   to check in at the desk, which sometimes might save you a few minutes.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.000]   But once in Salt Lake City, the line was like 15 people long and
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.560]   I just skipped right past it all.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.720]   Also, like I mentioned earlier, you might actually have elite status with
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.640]   one of these rental car companies from your credit card and get free upgrades.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.000]   Finally, since most rental car reservations come with no penalty if
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.400]   you never show up, they plan on a percentage of reservations
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.600]   never getting picked up.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.880]   That means that if everyone shows up, they might run out of cars.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.360]   So I always like to call the local agency office a few days before
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.920]   arriving, especially if I land late in the day, to confirm that I will be
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.000]   coming and I will be picking up the car.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.240]   So that's everything before you pick the car up.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.000]   Once I'm at the rental office, there's a few things I do.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.480]   I skip the insurance and I pay with my Chase Reserve or any other card
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.040]   that includes rental car coverage.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.720]   I never prepay for gas and I always look around the car and take photos
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.920]   of any dents, cracks in the windshield or anything else, and I point
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.240]   them out before I leave the lot.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.160]   I also once got a car with bald tires, so I always double check the tread.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.320]   Okay.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.880]   Hopefully that helps you save a bunch on your next rental car.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.320]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.600]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.160]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.280]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.720]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters, so you can enjoy
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.240]   their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.040]   the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.000]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade, sign up for a
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.680]   subscription or try one of their starter packs today, it's been so convenient for
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.960]   us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it and over the past year,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.520]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but this last bag of beans from
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:24.640]   Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.160]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.560]   Right now Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:39.280]   you visit allthehacks.com/trade that's allthehacks.com/trade for a free
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.320]   bag with select subscription plans.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.840]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:50.320]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.880]   leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.640]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen, but one of his top
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.760]   hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.040]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.200]   microwave cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.560]   partner with them for this episode.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.920]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.240]   scratch in the microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.160]   code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.200]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.880]   store, and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.640]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.400]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.920]   highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.320]   It is so good.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.800]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.920]   last year, you have to check it out.

[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.080]   Before we get back to the episode, I just want to thank you for

[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:20.760]   Okay.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.720]   This has been a lot of fun. For the last question, Yoshiko wrote in
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.240]   asking if I could share some tips for traveling during COVID,
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.840]   specifically around testing and making sure you don't get stuck
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.720]   somewhere abroad.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.280]   This is a great question.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.880]   It's one I've definitely thought about before the few trips I've
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.200]   taken during the pandemic.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.760]   So before you leave, there's really three things that I think about.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.160]   First, how serious is the situation in the country you're going to and
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.640]   how has that changed recently?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.120]   And you can usually find that on sites like the CDC or the New York
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.800]   Times has a map of the world.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.520]   I always think it's good to check in on the country you're going to.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.400]   Next, whether you want to take any extra insurance or health
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.400]   precautions in case you end up testing positive abroad.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.200]   And third, if you're going to a country that requires testing, making
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.920]   sure you have that sorted before you leave.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.880]   So the fear a lot of travelers have is that they might end up in some
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   remote destination and need medical care they wish they could get
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.560]   somewhere else.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.400]   Or even that they want to get back in their home country.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.280]   So in the past, I've used World Nomads for travel insurance and had a
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.000]   great experience, though to be fair, I've only ever had to get a stolen
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.040]   camera and a non-severe hospital visit reimbursed.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.000]   However, the circumstance many travelers fear during COVID is that
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.560]   they'll test positive and not be able to come home and either be forced
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.160]   to quarantine or worst case, be hospitalized in a foreign country.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.080]   The only company I've found that can help in that circumstance is
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.560]   called COVAC Global.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.360]   To be clear, I haven't used it and I'm not affiliated with them in any
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.840]   way, but they will pay for and arrange for their members to be
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.240]   repatriated should they test positive for COVID.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.400]   And they're the only option that doesn't require you to be
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.520]   hospitalized for that coverage to kick in.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.960]   That means they're coordinating private travel for you to get home.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.000]   And they say, for example, if you test positive in Europe, they can get
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.880]   you back home to the US in as little as 12 hours.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.720]   Now, coverage for one person on a 30-day trip is $995, which isn't
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.560]   cheap, but I can assure you that chartering a private jet to fly
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.360]   across the ocean would cost you so much more, not to mention all the
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.520]   coordination they'll have to do to transport someone who's tested
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.200]   positive. So if you want to protect yourself against that circumstance,
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.360]   it's something you could consider, but know that they require you
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.080]   purchase a policy 14 days in advance of travel or provide a negative
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.560]   PCR test within seven days of departure.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.680]   As for testing before travel, every country is different.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.120]   So you want to check on the latest information, usually on the
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:58.200]   tourism board website, the embassy or consulate website, or sometimes
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.480]   even on the airlines website.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:04.560]   Now, most pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens do PCR testing, and you
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.960]   get your results in a day or two.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.080]   You can also order an at-home kit from someone like Pixel or LabCorp
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.720]   and get results in a few days also.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:16.280]   Or if you need results faster than that, there's a bunch of companies
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.200]   with same-day and one-day tests.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.400]   One that I've found is Worksite Labs, which has testing locations
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.840]   around the country, and they'll get your results in as little as one
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.520]   and a half hours for $250 or within 24 hours for $90.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.680]   Also, many international airports have onsite testing, but they're
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.000]   also really expensive.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.280]   For example, at SFO, you can get tested in under an hour, but it's
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.120]   $275.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.640]   So once you're abroad, I really hope you just enjoy your travel and
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.720]   that the pandemic isn't an issue and you get to have an amazing trip.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.680]   But you will need to get tested before you fly home, at least if
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.120]   you're coming back to the States.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.960]   So if you want to get tested before you leave, I have two suggestions.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:04.640]   For me, I always bring the E-Med BinaxNOW tests that come with a
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.280]   video telehealth visit, which qualifies them for use to fly back into the U.S.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.440]   That way you can do the test wherever you are on your own time and know
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.960]   you'll get the results right away.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:21.320]   You can get one to three tests from Optum.com or six tests at emed.com.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.640]   And depending on how many you buy, they're $25 to $50 each.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.120]   Or if you don't want to deal with bringing your COVID tests with you, I
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.480]   would just reach out to the hotel concierge and ask them to help you
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.320]   coordinate getting tested before you leave.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.800]   Some resorts have free COVID pre-departure testing, and others
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.440]   can just coordinate a nurse coming to your room for testing.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.280]   Okay, so hopefully that helps you have a safe and easy trip.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.760]   Wow, I really forgot how much I love doing these episodes, so I'm definitely
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.120]   going to try to do them more often.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.000]   Or I might even try to incorporate a few questions each week, or even
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.280]   add a shorter second episode each week or every other week, just focused on Q&A.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.840]   So no matter what I do, please keep the questions coming.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.360]   I really love hearing from all of you, and I hope this is able to
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.360]   help you guys upgrade your lives.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.480]   If you enjoyed this episode, or just enjoy the show, please consider
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.200]   sharing it with a friend or family member who might like it.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.880]   It is really the best way to help me grow the show.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.760]   And if you heard planes flying over in the background during this episode,
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.520]   I am so sorry, I live near SFO, and it is raining outside, and whenever
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.560]   that happens, they divert all the flights right over our house.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.400]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.320]   I'll see you next week.
