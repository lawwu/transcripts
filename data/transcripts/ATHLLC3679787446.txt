[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.880]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.120]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.600]   hacks.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.560]   Okay.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   You all have amazing questions.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.600]   And I thought the Q&A episode from a few months ago was so great.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.600]   Well, the questions keep rolling in and I'm excited to do another episode.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.080]   In fact, there were so many questions that I don't know if I'm going to be able
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.920]   to get to all of them.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.720]   I tried answering a couple of the crypto questions in my episode with Kevin Rose,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.560]   and I may try to answer some of the money and investing ones with Josel Cihay from
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.320]   stacking Benjamins in a couple of weeks.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.840]   But today I'm going to tackle all the points, miles, credit card, and travel
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.400]   questions.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.240]   That includes using points, comparing cards, managing so many cards, finding the
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.040]   best cards for your spending, rental car hacks, and more, including a reversal on
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.720]   how I feel about the new Capital One Venture X card.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.120]   If you have any other questions, please send them in as I love doing these
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.800]   episodes.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.560]   My email is chris@allthehacks.com, and I would love to help you upgrade your life
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.920]   too.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   Also, one of the ways I earn money on this show is when you sign up for cards
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.040]   at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.960]   That definitely doesn't mean you should go sign up for a card you don't need just
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.560]   to help out.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.760]   But if you're already going to sign up, I'd love it if you use the link.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.320]   It should have the best signup bonuses, but if not, go wherever you can get the
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.240]   best bonus.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.240]   My priority is you earning the most points you can.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.960]   So with that out of the way, let's jump right in.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.080]   All right, so let's start with the Capital One Venture X card.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   In my newsletter about a month ago, I said it wasn't going to be in my wallet,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.000]   and I was wrong.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.440]   It's in my wallet right now, and I use it all the time.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.040]   And I want to talk about why.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.720]   So my default Everything Else card, where I don't have a bonus in a category, has
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.160]   always been the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.640]   It earns 1.5 points per dollar, and because I also have the Chase Sapphire
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.840]   Reserve card, those 1.5 points end up being able to be transferred to different
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.920]   airlines and hotels.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.640]   Or I can use them for 1.5 cents towards travel in the portal.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.160]   So 1.5 cents times 1.5 points per dollar means that it's an effective 2.25% cash
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.000]   back, and when I thought about the Venture X card earning 2 points worth 1 cent each,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.080]   I thought, "Well, this isn't better than the Freedom Unlimited, because 2.25 is
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.840]   better than 2."
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.160]   And I think it's historically that Capital One points weren't able to be
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   transferred to airlines and hotels that made me think about the comparison on the
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   effective cash back rates.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   However, I totally forgot that you can transfer all these Capital One points to
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.280]   airlines.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.120]   So you're getting 2 transferable points per dollar on the Venture X, and only 1.5
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.080]   on the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.360]   So apologies for that oversight.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.720]   If you're in the game of transferring points to airlines, which is how I use
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.680]   most of my points, the Capital One Venture X is going to earn 33% more points on
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.960]   everyday purchases than the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.560]   So I signed up and I got the huge 100,000 point signup bonus they have right now,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.360]   which does require spending $10,000 over the next six months, but the points guy
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.480]   values Capital One points at 1.85 cents per point.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   So that means your signup bonus is worth almost $2,000.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.320]   And yes, the card does have a $395 annual fee, but you get a $300 travel credit
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.920]   each year, you get a free Priority Pass membership for lounge access, you get a
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.200]   $200 credit on vacation rentals your first year, and 10,000 bonus points each
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.000]   year after that.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.160]   But even without all that, you're still getting 2 points per dollar that transfer
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.560]   to over a dozen airlines.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.000]   So I think this is a fantastic card.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.760]   It'll probably be in my wallet for a while, at least until there's some new
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   crazy offer or new amazing card.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.120]   I liked it so much my wife actually signed up for it also.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.680]   So now we have two in the house.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.920]   And yes, that means paying two annual fees.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.520]   I'll get to that in the next question.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.240]   But that means over the next six months, we'll have racked up over 240,000 Capital
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.520]   One points if you include the $10,000 we each have to spend to get the signup bonus.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.840]   So if you're interested in the card, I'd love it if you use my referral link to
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.480]   sign up, it's allthehacks.com/venturex.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.960]   This is a different link than my normal allthehacks.com/cards link.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.920]   And that's because the /cards link right now actually earns nothing for the
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.240]   Venture X signup, so /venturex is actually my personal referral link.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   So after you get the card, you should start using your own referral link to
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.920]   tell your friends about it.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.480]   They'll earn 100,000 points and you can earn some bonus points too.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.640]   That's also a great segue to our first listener question from Jenny about why
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.320]   the Venture cards from Capital One aren't a top pick.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.240]   As you can see, things are changing.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   But the primary reason I still don't put them at the top of the list is that they
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.600]   don't offer any big category bonuses on earning.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.280]   So you can get a whole lot more points on things like travel, dining, and
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.960]   groceries with other cards.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.640]   That said, I do think the Venture and Venture X cards are good kind of
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.520]   everything else cards now that you can transfer their points to airlines, and I
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.800]   will definitely be using them in 2022.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.840]   So Sean wrote in with a great question.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.000]   He's repeatedly heard from people who travel for free, having 25 or 30 cards
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.040]   that they track across lots of spreadsheets, and wanted to know if they
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.080]   all pay annual fees on all these cards, or do they cancel the cards, and is it
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.000]   all worth it, and what about the credit hits that they have, and do they even
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.320]   close cards and reopen the same ones later?
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.400]   So while I've probably opened maybe 25 or 30 cards in my entire life, I probably
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.760]   have about a dozen right now, but when it comes to opening all these cards in the
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.240]   first place, I think sometimes the calculus is very different the first
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.960]   year than it is for ongoing years.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.320]   So in the first year, you might get a signup bonus worth a thousand, even $2,000.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.880]   And so it might make sense to open up that card, meet the minimum spend
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.720]   requirements, collect the points, and reevaluate after one year.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.440]   And at that one year point, when I get that second annual fee, which you
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.720]   usually have some time to be able to go back to the issuer and say, "Please,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   actually, I don't want to renew this card," and get that annual fee refunded.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.280]   I decide if it's worth it on an ongoing basis, and sometimes it is, because you
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.800]   might be getting, in the case of a Marriott Bonvoy Amex, you might be getting
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.240]   a free night's stay every year, and an annual fee is $95.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.480]   So if the perks make it worth the annual fee, you might keep it.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.160]   Or if you spend enough money that the incremental miles or points that you
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.400]   get from your spend on that card is worth it, then that's another good reason.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.680]   So let's take an example of someone who has a Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.120]   and a Chase Freedom Unlimited.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.200]   So they're already getting three points per dollar on travel and dining, and they
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.560]   get one and a half points on everything else.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.080]   Let's say they opened up an Amex Gold to get a big signup bonus, and they're
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.760]   deciding whether they keep it or not.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.360]   Well, with the Amex Gold, they're getting four points per
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.760]   dollar on dining and groceries.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.120]   So that's an extra one point per dollar on dining over the Chase Reserve, and an
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.840]   extra 2.5 points per dollar over the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.560]   So do they spend enough money each year that one extra point per dollar on
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.040]   dining and two and a half points per dollar on groceries makes up the annual
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.400]   fee?
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.720]   Well, the Amex Gold is $250 per year, but you get $10 a month for Uber
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.400]   and $10 per month for Grubhub.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.000]   Now, if you're really efficient, you could get $240 of value out of that and
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.200]   make the effective annual fee $10, but let's say we're only able to get $100 of
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.960]   value here because it's hard to remember to order out from two different places
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.760]   every single month.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.800]   That means the effective annual fee is $150.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.160]   Now, I always use the Points Guys valuations, which I'll link to in the
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.120]   show notes, but they say Amex points are worth two cents.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.880]   So $150 divided by 0.02 is 7,500 points.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.080]   So with an extra two and a half points on groceries and one point on dining, will
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.760]   they earn 7,500 points?
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.440]   Let's say you assume a 50/50 split on groceries and dining spending, then that
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.280]   means they have to spend about $4,300 per year on dining and groceries for it to be
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.400]   worth it to keep the card.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.520]   So if that makes sense, great.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.720]   But another consideration is whether you need to keep the card open to not lose the
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.280]   points.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.480]   And if you're in a situation where you have 150,000 Amex points, but the card is
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.800]   your only Amex, you might want to keep it just to make sure you don't lose the
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.280]   points.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.760]   Capital One and Chase have ways that you could transfer points to your spouse, but
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.440]   Amex doesn't.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.520]   So if I've ultimately decided a card isn't worth it and I want to cancel it, I
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.280]   first call the issuer and let them know that given the annual fee and the
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.000]   benefits, the card just isn't worth it and I want to cancel it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.720]   And sometimes I've been offered bonus points, waived annual fees, and other
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.000]   perks to keep the card open.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   So I might do that.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.000]   Other times I get nothing and I just cancel the card.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.120]   The only exception to that is when I've had a card for a really long time, I
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.880]   ask the issuer if there's a free card I can downgrade to.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.040]   That way I keep the really long history of that card on my credit history to
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.280]   balance out the average length of credit history, which helps with your credit
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.640]   score.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.520]   Another pro tip, if you have a few different cards with an issuer like
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.520]   Chase, you can actually ask Chase to move credit between them.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.840]   So if you're going to cancel a card, you could move all but $1,000 of that card's
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.080]   credit limit to another card and then cancel it.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.480]   So to summarize and to make sure I hit all of Sean's questions, yes, I pay all
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.680]   the annual fees, but in the first year, the signup bonus almost always makes it
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.040]   worth it.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.680]   After that, I only pay for annual fees in subsequent years when the benefits
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.520]   exceed the fee.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.960]   The value's not there, I cancel the card or downgrade it.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.400]   And finally, yes, it's absolutely worth it for me because I love traveling the
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.040]   world for free.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.960]   All right, so up next, Dick and Willie, I'm not making this up folks, both had
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.480]   questions about using points.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.160]   Dick asked if I could recommend a company to help people use points more
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.880]   efficiently.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.240]   He has almost half a million points and wants to get way more value than the
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.720]   portal.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.840]   And Willie wants to plan some trips to Mexico and Hawaii and wants the best
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.600]   deals as well.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.040]   So this is a big topic and I'm even thinking of writing a whole guide to help
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.240]   out.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.480]   But until I do, here's my thoughts.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.720]   Dick is correct that you get a much better value transferring points than
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.560]   booking in the portal.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.880]   Sometimes it might be 10 or 15% better and sometimes it might even be worse.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.160]   But other times it can be three or four times better or more.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.560]   For example, a colleague of mine last week was looking to book a nice hotel in
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.640]   Cabo for a three-day weekend next March.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.400]   All of the five-star hotels were over $1,000 a night and the one he really had
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.960]   his eye on, The Cape, which is an incredible hotel, was $1,600 per night
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.040]   after taxes.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.080]   So booking in the Chase portal would have been about 100,000 points per night
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.000]   because he had the reserve and he got 1.5 cents per point.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.120]   Well, since The Cape is a Hyatt property, he was able to transfer his Chase
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.760]   points directly to Hyatt and book for just 25,000 points per night.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.480]   So he got three nights for 75,000 points, which would have otherwise cost him
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.280]   either $4,800 in cash or 320,000 points in the portal.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.040]   He got a value of 6.4 cents per point, which is amazing.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.320]   And in the last Q&A, I mentioned my neighbor who booked four business class
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.600]   tickets to Europe that would have cost him about $20,000 or $22,000, almost a
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.920]   million and a half points in the portal for just 440,000 points by transferring
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.720]   them to Air France and booking with Air France Miles.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.640]   He got a value of almost 5 cents per point.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.760]   So why isn't this easy?
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.960]   Well, sometimes it is.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.080]   Sometimes you can just go to look at the Airline Transfer Partners websites, look
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.600]   for flights quickly, and you might just see a great deal for the exact times you
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.920]   want to fly, and if that's the case, just transfer the points and book it.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.680]   The challenge is that Chase, Amex, Capital One, each have over a dozen
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.000]   transfer partners, so that could be a lot of searching, and one of the
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.760]   keys is to be flexible on dates.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.760]   So each time you search, you might search for different dates
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.080]   and it can take a long time.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.280]   One option is to pay for Point.me, which is a search engine, kind of like Google
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.040]   Flights, but just for award availability across all the transfer partners of
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.440]   different points programs like Chase or Amex.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:54.120]   It costs $95 a year or $15 for five days, but it will save you so much time.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.040]   I've had a ton of success with it, and a few readers have even written in
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.800]   saying they've had great success too.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.080]   If all that seems like too much work, then you could just use an award booking
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.200]   service and they'll take care of everything for you.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.160]   Point.me calls it their concierge service.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.480]   I've heard great things about it.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.680]   The points guy mentioned Points Pros in our interview, but there's dozens of
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.400]   services out there and they all end up costing a few hundred dollars per person.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.160]   Now, oftentimes that's contingent on finding something, so you
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.680]   aren't committed to spend it all.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.320]   And while that might seem like a lot, in the case of my neighbor, in the
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.640]   case of the trip my neighbor took, if he had spent $800 for a family of
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.480]   four to get $22,000 of flights for just 440,000 chase points, it
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.680]   would have been totally worth it.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.040]   So hopefully that helps.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.400]   Of course, I always suggest starting to look at a few of the most obvious
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.800]   transfer partners first and comparing the number of miles you need to use on
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.960]   their website with the number of points you'd need to book in the portal
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.160]   to see if you can find a deal.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.960]   In my opinion, anything over two cents per point is good.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.160]   Anything over three cents is fantastic.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.840]   And if you're regularly getting five or more cents per point, let me know
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.080]   because you should probably be doing these episodes instead of me.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.280]   So when it comes to hotels, it's all a little bit easier.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.640]   The only time I've ever transferred points to a hotel
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.760]   program is from Chase to Hyatt.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.640]   Every other deal from Amex, from Capital One, I don't think is worth it.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.440]   So if the place you're trying to stay isn't a Hyatt property, then you don't
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.360]   even have to worry about trying to use your points unless you're trying
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.240]   to book through the portal.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   Hey everybody.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.360]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me, my
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:37.000]   favorite award search tool, to give you a special offer of only $1 for your
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.680]   first month of their standard plan if you go to allthehacks.com/pointme
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.640]   and use the promo code HACKS.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:52.120]   Again, allthehacks.com/P-O-I-N-T-M-E or find the link in the show notes.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.480]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with points.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.280]   So Sue wrote in with another booking with points questions.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.160]   She wants to take her bucket list trip to Italy next year with her two kids and
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.960]   wants to make sure she has enough points to do it.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.880]   Specifically, she asked whether 300,000 points is enough for
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.280]   four people to get to Europe.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.400]   And while she already has some Amex points, she wants to know if it's
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.200]   better to focus on Amex or Chase and whether signup bonuses should be
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.560]   the way to boost their balance.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.520]   This will also get at Emilio's question about issues with having points spread
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.360]   out across too many card programs.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.720]   First off, these are great questions.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.800]   I'll start by saying if you're okay flying in coach, then 300,000 points
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.120]   should be enough, but if you want to do business, you're going to be short.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.680]   Now let's assume she's going to be short and needs to close the gap.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.280]   In general, I don't think it makes much sense to start trying to earn
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.920]   points in multiple programs until you have enough points in one
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.400]   program to cover everyone.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.600]   And that's because they don't all have the same transfer partners.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.880]   For example, if you find a flight on Lufthansa, you could book it with
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.120]   Amex points by transferring to Air Canada, or you could book with Chase
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.800]   points by transferring to United, but you can't transfer to the same place.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.480]   So you'd have to end up booking part of the trip separately.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.400]   Now, when you pay for flights or even when you book in the portal, booking
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.120]   two one-ways is often more expensive than booking a round trip.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.520]   However, one of the best things about booking directly with airlines
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.480]   after you transfer points to them is that it's easy to book one way.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.800]   So if you had enough Amex points to book your flight to Europe, you could focus
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.680]   on collecting Chase points to book your return, so the exact plan might
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.920]   be different for each person, but either way, I do think that sign up bonuses
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.320]   are going to be your best bet for closing the gap, and you can find the
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.640]   top sign up bonuses right now at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.880]   So Don wrote in with a question about booking in the portal.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.520]   He pointed out that so many cards are giving big bonuses
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.040]   when you book in their portal.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.520]   For example, the Chase reserve earned 10x on hotels and 5x on flights
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.960]   for paid bookings in the portal.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.200]   Now that's when you're not using points.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.400]   He wanted to know when that makes sense.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.080]   So this is a tough one because there's no clear answer.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   When you book directly with the airlines and hotels, you might earn less points,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   but it is so much easier if things go wrong or need to be changed.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.680]   And like I've shared in the past, your odds of getting an upgrade by reaching
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   out to the hotel is infinitely better when you book direct.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.280]   When you book with the portals, you often have to make all your changes
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.600]   and cancellations through the portal, which can be more difficult.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.400]   For me, I already earned 5x on flights booked directly with
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.240]   the airlines through the Amex Platinum.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.960]   So I've never actually thought about booking flights on the portal.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.840]   And even if I'm just getting an additional two points per dollar over
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.760]   the reserves 3x on travel, it'd have to be really, really expensive for me to do it.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:48.040]   On hotels, I guess if the cancellation policy was reasonable and the deal was
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.920]   comparable or better, I'd probably go for it because I couldn't earn anywhere
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.120]   close to 10x points booking elsewhere.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.760]   That said, assume you're definitely not getting that upgrade or any special
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.440]   treatment when you check in, but it's probably worth it for all the extra points.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.960]   Finally, if you have a card like the Capital One Venture X, where your travel
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.920]   credit is tied to booking in the portal, then I'd definitely book in the portal
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.800]   at least enough to earn my full credit.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.240]   Now, Jessica had an important follow-up to this.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.000]   She asked if the prices are the same in the portal as they are elsewhere online.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.360]   And they usually are, but it's always worth double checking quick because
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.640]   I definitely wouldn't want to pay extra to get a few more points.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.000]   And there is one other interesting thing, not all flights
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.440]   and hotels are in the portal.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.320]   So if you have your heart set on a specific flight, you just might not be
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.800]   able to buy it in the portal, and that's just how it works.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.920]   I've tried searching weird, different ways, and I could never get
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.520]   some of certain flights to show up.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.120]   And you can find the top signup bonuses right now at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.360]   Now, I also got a few questions about direct card comparisons.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.280]   Steven has the Chase Freedom and has had it for a while and wanted to know about
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.560]   switching to the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.000]   Now, I've had both of those cards for the past two or three years, and I use the
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.760]   Freedom Unlimited almost 10 times more than the Freedom.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.680]   For those of you who don't know, the Freedom is a card that earns 5X points
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.480]   per dollar on a different category each quarter, and since you never know what
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.520]   it's going to be, it's really hard to make any plans.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.480]   There've been multiple quarters in a row where the card's been totally useless.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   And then Q4 this year has been PayPal, which I've been able to max out.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.200]   So as a compliment to the Sapphire Preferred or Reserve, I've always thought
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.160]   the Unlimited was the best second card.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.760]   Now, that gets a little more complicated for me personally, because now I have the
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.280]   Capital One Venture X, and it's going to be my new everyday spending card.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   So I imagine the Unlimited is really only going to be a card I use for drug stores
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.760]   where it earns more points than any other card, which actually means the Freedom
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.960]   will get a lot more usage than the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.800]   But for most people who aren't trying to spread their points over lots of
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.480]   different programs and have lots of different cards, I think the combo of a
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.440]   Sapphire Preferred or Reserve and the Freedom Unlimited is a better combo
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.960]   than pairing it with the Freedom.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.920]   Now, Jessica had another question.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.680]   She wanted my thoughts on comparing the Sapphire Reserve and the Amex Platinum,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.360]   asking which one comes out ahead.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.760]   Now on the surface, they're both premium travel cards with lounge access, but I
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.600]   actually think this one's a much easier question.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.960]   The only money I really ever put on my Platinum card is Airfare for the 5X points.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.880]   It only earns one point per dollar on everything else, and I really view the
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.400]   Platinum much more as a perks card, with the primary benefit being getting
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.920]   access to the Centurion Lounge.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.120]   And while the annual fee is high, I think if you use the credits they offer, it
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.960]   can come close to netting out to zero.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.760]   The same thing is true on the Sapphire Reserve in terms of cutting the annual
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.960]   fee down, but you earn bonuses on travel and dining, which is a large portion of
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.040]   my spend, so I think that one's a much easier decision, and I think the Sapphire
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.920]   Reserve, for most people, comes out ahead.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.880]   I hope that helps you both pick your next card.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.800]   All right, so both Sherelle and Scott had questions about having multiple Chase
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.960]   Sapphire cards, and in both scenarios, they had the Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.320]   and wanted to get the Reserve.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.560]   The issue is, you can't have multiple Chase Sapphire cards.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.000]   So my wife and I were in this exact situation, and here's what we did.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.640]   We didn't want to lose our points, so we didn't want to just close out our
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.520]   Preferred cards, so we each downgraded them to no annual fee cards.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.400]   I went to the Freedom Unlimited, and she went to the Freedom.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.760]   Then, after that was official, we waited a few weeks, though, if you want to play
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.400]   it safe, you should probably wait 30 days, and we applied for the Reserve.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.800]   But there's one other important requirement.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.720]   It has to have been 48 months or 4 years from the last Sapphire bonus.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.360]   In our case, we had opened the Preferred more than 4 years ago, so it wasn't an
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.200]   issue, but if the statement closing date, when you got the sign-up bonus from
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   whichever Sapphire card you opened already was in the last 4 years,
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.720]   then you're going to have to wait.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.560]   There is another option.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.000]   You can always upgrade or downgrade from one Sapphire card to the other, but you
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.600]   won't get a sign-up bonus when you do it.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.520]   So if you really want the Chase Reserve card, you could upgrade your Preferred,
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.960]   but you'll miss out on that opportunity to get those bonus points, and hopefully
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.200]   that helps you figure out what to do.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.440]   Okay, this is a fun one because I've gone through it myself.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.920]   David wrote in saying he got married last year, but he and his wife Casey still have
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.400]   their individual credit cards, including two Chase Sapphire Reserves.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.480]   He wanted to know if there was a way to benefit from a rewards perspective by
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.600]   consolidating, or if he should keep them separate.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.880]   First off, congrats to David and Casey.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.200]   This is a great question.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.120]   So you're probably right that it doesn't make sense to be paying two
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.680]   annual fees for the Reserve card.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.280]   But before you do anything, you'll want to make sure you're
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.400]   not going to lose any points.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.440]   The good news is that Chase will let you transfer Ultimate Rewards points
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.120]   between members of your household for free.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.760]   Sometimes it doesn't work to link the accounts online, so you might have to
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.440]   call, but it's definitely possible and allowed.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.520]   So before you cancel any cards, just make sure you move the
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.840]   points around so you don't lose them.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   Okay, so the obvious answer would be for one of you to cancel your Reserve and get
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.040]   added as an authorized user to the other one's card.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.440]   That's not a bad option, but the downside is that you only have a joint account,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.640]   which can be frustrating for some couples, and it also means that the other person
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.600]   will lose their card from their credit history.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.080]   Now, you could downgrade the card to a good no-annual-fee card like the Freedom
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.440]   Flex or Freedom Unlimited, but unless that cardholder has a Sapphire card
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.280]   also, you don't actually earn Ultimate Rewards points, so you aren't able to
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.120]   use your points to transfer to airlines.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.880]   So I'll throw out another option.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.360]   One of you could downgrade to the Sapphire Preferred.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.840]   You'd still earn 3x on Dining, like the Reserve, but you'd
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.200]   only earn 2x on Travel.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.120]   However, most travel purchases are booked online, so you could still use the other
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.120]   person's Reserve card to book travel and earn 3x points.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.000]   This way, you both have separate cards, and you probably won't lose out on that
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.640]   many points, and you both keep your credit history.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.680]   Technically, it's $20 more because the Preferred costs $95 a year and an
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.720]   authorized cardholder on the Reserve is $75, but both are going to be cheaper
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.920]   than two Reserve cards.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.400]   Another couple downsides to know about.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.280]   The Preferred doesn't get you free TSA Pre or Global Entry, though I would say
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.800]   use that credit before you get rid of your Reserve and it's good for 5 years,
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.560]   and it doesn't get Priority Pass for Lounge Access, but the Reserve's Priority
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.240]   Pass allows for two free guests, so it's really only an issue when one
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.360]   of you is traveling alone.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.200]   Okay, if you want the next-level hack version, and it's been 4 years since
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.640]   you've opened your Reserve card, you could actually just downgrade your
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.960]   Reserve to a free card, like the Freedom Unlimited, and then open a new
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.120]   Sapphire Preferred and get the sign-up bonus on that card.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.680]   Hopefully, that helps.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.560]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size, and
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.360]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.480]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week, and you have too many
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.440]   manual processes, and there's no one source of truth.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.480]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.680]   37,025, 1.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.040]   37,000, that's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.000]   Oracle, and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.560]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.840]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.240]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.880]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.800]   in days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.720]   And 1, because your business is one-of-a-kind, so you get a customized
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.400]   solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of

[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:12.440]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.320]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.920]   and makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.720]   bonuses on every purchase.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.160]   You can also load it on your partner's phone, so they always
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.760]   know the best cards to use.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.880]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.560]   credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.640]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of America, or
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.960]   Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.240]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.880]   Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.360]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.200]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.640]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.680]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.560]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:17.960]   will, you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:23.040]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.360]   Okay, changing gears a bit, I want to move over to business credit cards.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.880]   Not just because they have some of the best signup bonuses out there, but
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   because Braxton wrote in asking about the best cards for his newly formed LLC.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.440]   Well, the first thing to know is that you don't actually need any official
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.720]   business registration or entity number to get a business credit card.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.640]   In fact, your personal credit is tied to most business credit cards.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.600]   That means you can definitely sign up for a business card if you want to take
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.920]   advantage of some of these big signup bonuses.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.280]   If you want some tips, I'll link to a few articles in the show notes.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.040]   As for which cards, I'll point out a few things.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.840]   First off, you don't actually need to use a business card for business expenses.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.480]   It definitely might help you for keeping organized and tracking things.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.440]   But even when I ran my own business, I put all my flights on my personal
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.360]   Platinum Amex because it earned 5x on airfare.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.520]   That said, there are a few business cards I think are a great place to start.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.960]   I personally really like the Ink Business Preferred the most.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.080]   It has 3x on travel, shipping, internet cable and phone
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.440]   services, and online advertising.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.240]   It also pairs nicely with the Ink Business Unlimited, which earns
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.040]   one and a half points on everything.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:39.560]   And if you have the Sapphire Preferred or Reserve, you can link up all your
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.160]   personal and business cards, combine ultimate rewards balances, and transfer
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.040]   any and all of those points to airline and hotel partners.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.040]   And best of all, the Ink Business Preferred has a massive
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.960]   100,000 Chase Point signup bonus right now that you can get
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.880]   at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.600]   On the Amex side, I used to have the Business Gold, which
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.840]   has a really cool feature.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.400]   It earns 4 points per dollar on whatever two categories you spend the most on each
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.680]   month from a list of six categories, which are airfare, advertising, computer
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.760]   hardware and software, gas, restaurants, and shipping.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.160]   One thing to note is that while your personal credit is needed to open a
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.800]   business card, some issuers like Chase don't actually report the
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.400]   card to personal credit bureaus.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.200]   Okay.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.720]   So Cody wrote in saying he listened to the episode about credit card points and
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   wanted to know what to do to earn the most points for gas.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.120]   He does a lot of driving for work and wanted to get the best card.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:41.880]   So the Citi Premier earns 3x points on gas, and the points guy values him at 1.7
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.160]   cents, so that's about 5.1% cash back on gas.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.680]   It's also a good card that gets 3x on air travel, hotels, supermarkets, and
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.440]   restaurants, and has over a dozen transfer partners.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.200]   Now, it does have a $95 annual fee, but you get a $100 hotel credit on a $500 or
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.760]   more hotel stay, and there's an 80,000 point signup bonus at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.080]   So that's one option.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.600]   Another one is the Blue Cash Preferred, which gets just 3% cash back on gas.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   The Costco card gets 4% back, but only on the first $7,000.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.920]   And there's also a link I'll put to Doctor of Credit's website that has an
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.400]   updated list of the best gas credit cards.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.680]   I love this next question from Sudarsan.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.520]   He said, "I have a lot of cards and I couldn't find an app to figure out what
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.600]   the best cash back is for a retailer."
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.640]   He pointed out there used to be this app called Wallaby, but it doesn't exist anymore.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.360]   So I think there's two apps worth checking out here.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.480]   This is a quick answer.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.840]   The new Points Guy app has a feature exactly for this.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.800]   You load in all your cards and you can actually pick a retailer, but it only
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.720]   works by picking something that's in your vicinity with your location on.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.240]   And it only works on iOS.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.680]   There's another app that I just tried out that I really like called Card Pointers.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:02.760]   Now, you can't say a specific retailer, but once you load in all of your cards,
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.640]   you can go through each category and it really simply breaks out the best
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.400]   card in your arsenal for each one.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.680]   Now, I had to go in and manually override a few of the
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.360]   categories, so it's not perfect.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.160]   But if I were trying to find an app to do this, those are
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.280]   the two apps I would check out.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.960]   So while we're talking about having all of these points and miles
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.120]   and different accounts, Alex had a great question.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.360]   He said, "I referenced a spreadsheet that I use to track all my rewards and points
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.520]   for all of my cards and asked if I could share my template."
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.760]   So first off, yes, if you want to check out the template, it's
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.080]   allthehacks.com/pointstracker.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.400]   However, I will say that it's a completely manual template that's
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.520]   all tracked in a Google Sheet.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.440]   And while it's fun for me to do sometimes, I'm really excited about what
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.080]   the Points Guy launched with their new app, and I'm really hoping that
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.360]   that can replace this for me.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.440]   Maybe it won't, maybe it'll take some time, but I would love to move off
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.720]   of this spreadsheet in the future.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.480]   Hopefully the whole spreadsheet makes sense.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.440]   There's a row for all the different programs.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.800]   There's columns for different people in your household.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.600]   I even use the Points Guy's points valuations at one point so that I
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.280]   can track the value of everything.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.160]   I also use colors and notes in the spreadsheet to be able to point out
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.320]   when things expire and whether I need to act on it soon, but hopefully this is
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   helpful, I just can't wait till someone can build something that actually
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.600]   works to automate all of this.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   Now, this next question might be familiar for a lot of you that
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.280]   live in a hub for one airline.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.600]   Andrew wrote in for Minneapolis, a major Delta hub and his primary airline.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.040]   He pointed out that while Amex points can transfer to Delta, he feels
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.800]   like he can't take advantage of some of the other exciting cards
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.200]   and signup bonuses he sees.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.920]   Now, I know a lot of people in a similar situation, and they feel like they've
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.040]   committed to one carrier for all their travel.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.680]   In fact, I've lived most of my entire life near DC, Denver, and San
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.800]   Francisco, which are all United hubs.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.040]   So you probably accrue a lot of points on your home airline, and if you're
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.360]   just looking for a card that helps you top up that bonus, then you need
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.720]   to get a card that supports that.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:03.480]   Delta has Amex, United has Chase, Citi has American, however, if it's really
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.080]   more about the status you have on that airline, then it doesn't really
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.800]   matter because that status will apply across all the airline's partners.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.440]   So if you have Delta Platinum status, but you have Chase points, you can
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.200]   always transfer them to another SkyTeam partner like Air France and book
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.440]   with their miles and still benefit from your status across the whole alliance.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.160]   For me, I'm actually always trying to use my miles for international
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.240]   business, so whether I have status on United or not doesn't matter because
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.280]   when you book in business class, you already get priority boarding,
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.800]   faster security, and free check bags.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.240]   So we talked so much about using points to fly internationally, but
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.800]   Jennifer asked if there are ever any deals for business class flights or
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.680]   whether the only way to do it is points.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.880]   Well, the best place I've found to find all the deals for business and
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.040]   first-class flights is the Premium Fare Deals Forum on Flyertalk, which
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.280]   I'll link to in the show notes.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.920]   I'm looking at it now, and while it's a little tough to filter by your
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.960]   home airport, I'm seeing some crazy business class deals like SF to Madrid
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.440]   for $1,800 and LA to Lima in Peru for $850.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.560]   I've also seen some good deals by following the points guy or the flight
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.600]   deal on Twitter, but it doesn't happen that often.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.960]   You can also just search with no destination on Google Flights and
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.680]   switch to business class and see what might exist.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.360]   For example, I'm looking right now in the spring for business class
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.480]   flights under $3,000, and you can go to Berlin, Rome, Istanbul,
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.880]   Cairo, and so many other places.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.320]   Two other sites I've found, but I can't endorse because I've never
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   tried them, but they could be worth checking out are First Class Flyer.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.840]   It's a paid subscription, but it looks like they've got a 14-day trial for $1.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.240]   And Mighty Travels also has a paid newsletter that I haven't tried,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.800]   but it seems to focus on premium cabins and lets you specify your home airport.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.160]   Hopefully that helps, but again, I do think that the cheapest way to
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.960]   travel internationally is to start hacking the game with points and miles.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.160]   All right, so this isn't just going to be about flights and hotels.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.880]   Rick emailed in asking for rental car hacks, and I have a few I'd love to share.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.200]   So I'll start out when you're searching for a car.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.480]   You can use an aggregator like Kayak to find the lowest prices, but
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.920]   oftentimes the discount codes get the best rates, and you can only put those
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.960]   in on the rental car company websites.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.360]   You'd be surprised to find that you might have access to way more
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.960]   rental car discounts than you know.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.320]   For example, many big employers have great rates.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.920]   I know I did at Google, but I also find great prices with
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.400]   Avis using the Costco discount.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.680]   My business fraternity from college somehow offers a really good rate at
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:55.040]   Enterprise, and other organizations like AAA or USAA have discounts as well.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.680]   That means that you have to go to a few rental car websites to search around,
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.920]   but I've seen rates drop in half using these discounts.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.080]   Also, many premium travel cards like the Platinum or the Chase Reserve come
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.440]   with status on various rental car companies, so that can save you money.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.640]   And if you want to splurge on an Audi with Silver Car, which has been a
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.480]   fantastic experience every time I've done it, Visa Infinite cards like
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.680]   the Chase Reserve get 30% off.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.600]   Now, if you're looking at an airport and everything is expensive, you might
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.480]   want to look to rent downtown in the city you're flying into to save money,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.920]   and then just take an Uber or a Lyft to get there.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.880]   You could also check out sites like Turo, which is like Airbnb for rental cars.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.680]   I know a lot of people who've had success there, but I personally hate having to
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   coordinate with another person after a long flight, and I just prefer
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.040]   grabbing something at the airport.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.960]   During your reservation, if you get the option to save money by prepaying
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.120]   for your rental car, here's how I think about it.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.320]   Because rental car prices fluctuate so much, if I'm booking far in advance
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:05.120]   and the rate is high, I usually won't prepay, so I can check back in every
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.520]   few weeks or months to see if the rates have dropped.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.960]   If so, I just rebook and cancel the reservation.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   But if I'm closer to travel and the risk of canceling the trip is really low, if
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.720]   the discount's big enough, I'll take it.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.000]   Also, sometimes rates for a full week are significantly cheaper.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.640]   So even if you only need the car for five or six days, it might be
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.280]   cheaper to book for a whole week.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   Also, you pay for rental cars on 24-hour periods, so on the off chance you need
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.480]   a car for a few hours more than some multiple of 24, you're going to have to
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.000]   pay for a full day for that extra hour or two.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.920]   However, if you read the fine print, some companies give you an
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.800]   hour or two for free if you're late.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.200]   So if I needed a car from 10 a.m.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.520]   one day to 11 a.m.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.040]   another day, I'll actually book it from 10 a.m.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.840]   to 10 a.m.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.280]   and just drop it off an hour late for free and not pay the extra day.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.760]   Now, before you book, I definitely recommend joining the loyalty
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.200]   program of the rental car company.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.440]   Even the free tier often means you can pick up your car without having to
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.840]   check in at the desk, which sometimes might save you a few minutes, but once
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.800]   in Salt Lake City, the line was like 15 people long and I just skipped right past it all.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.200]   Also, like I mentioned earlier, you might actually have elite status with one of
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.840]   these rental car companies from your credit card and get free upgrades.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.280]   Finally, since most rental car reservations come with no penalty if you
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.800]   never show up, they plan on a percentage of reservations never getting picked up.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.120]   That means that if everyone shows up, they might run out of cars.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.160]   So I always like to call the local agency office a few days before arriving,
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.600]   especially if I land late in the day, to confirm that I will be coming
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.200]   and I will be picking up the car.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.440]   So that's everything before you pick the car up.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.200]   Once I'm at the rental office, there's a few things I do.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.720]   I skip the insurance and I pay with my Chase Reserve or any other card
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.280]   that includes rental car coverage.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:06.640]   I never prepay for gas and I always look around the car and take photos of any
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.120]   dents, cracks in the windshield or anything else, and I point them out before I leave
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.520]   the lot.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.400]   I also once got a car with bald tires, so I always double check the tread.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.560]   Okay.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.120]   Hopefully that helps you save a bunch on your next rental car.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:26.280]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.480]   for you and nothing showcases that better than Puerh Tea.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.920]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.360]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:42.600]   Peak's Puerh Teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.880]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:52.120]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.000]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.160]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.480]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.760]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.480]   Puerh for mental clarity and energy and the black Puerh, which helps kickstart
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:18.600]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.240]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.880]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.120]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.600]   and then be happy that Puerh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.440]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.400]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.800]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money backed guarantee.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.400]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.680]   tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:58.280]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:05.040]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.320]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.880]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.000]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.440]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.440]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters, so you can enjoy
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.040]   their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.760]   cost of going out for coffee.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.720]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade, sign up for a
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.800]   subscription, or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.200]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.680]   it, and over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.480]   this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.360]   Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.880]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:58.240]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.440]   you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:07.000]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.520]   Allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.920]   Before we get back to the episode, I just want to thank you for listening
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.280]   to and supporting the show.

[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.040]   Okay, this has been a lot of fun.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.280]   For the last question, Yoshiko wrote in asking if I could share some tips for
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.520]   traveling during COVID, specifically around testing and making sure you
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.120]   don't get stuck somewhere abroad.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.640]   This is a great question, and it's one I've definitely thought about before the
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   few trips I've taken during the pandemic.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.200]   So before you leave, there's really three things that I think about.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.880]   First, how serious is the situation in the country you're going to and how has
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.080]   that changed recently?
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.520]   And you can usually find that on sites like the CDC or the New York
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.200]   Times has a map of the world.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.920]   I always think it's good to check in on the country you're going to.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.000]   Next, whether you want to take any extra insurance or health precautions in case
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.800]   you end up testing positive abroad.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.000]   And third, if you're going to a country that requires testing, making sure you
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.440]   have that sorted before you leave.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.680]   So the fear a lot of travelers have is that they might end up in some remote
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.800]   destination and need medical care they wish they could get somewhere else, or
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.880]   even that they want to get back in their home country.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.120]   So in the past, I've used World Nomads for travel insurance and had a great
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.400]   experience, though to be fair, I've only ever had to get a stolen camera and a
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.520]   non-severe hospital visit reimbursed.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.880]   However, the circumstance many travelers fear during COVID is that they'll test
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:51.600]   positive and not be able to come home and either be forced to quarantine or worst
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.640]   case, be hospitalized in a foreign country.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.440]   The only company I've found that can help in that circumstance is called COVAC
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.000]   Global.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.760]   To be clear, I haven't used it and I'm not affiliated with them in any way, but
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.160]   they will pay for and arrange for their members to be repatriated should they
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.760]   test positive for COVID and they're the only option that doesn't require you to
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.960]   be hospitalized for that coverage to kick in.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.240]   That means they're coordinating private travel for you to get home and they say,
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.320]   for example, if you test positive in Europe, they can get you back home to the
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   US in as little as 12 hours.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:34.160]   Now, coverage for one person on a 30-day trip is $995, which isn't cheap, but I
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.440]   can assure you that chartering a private jet to fly across the ocean would cost
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   you so much more, not to mention all the coordination they'll have to do to
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.480]   transport someone who's tested positive.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.160]   So, if you want to protect yourself against that circumstance, it's something
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:53.960]   you could consider, but know that they require you purchase a policy 14 days in
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:58.920]   advance of travel or provide a negative PCR test within seven days of departure.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.200]   As for testing before travel, every country is different, so you want to check
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.720]   on the latest information, usually on the tourism board website, the embassy or
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.880]   consulate website, or sometimes even on the airline's website.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:17.120]   Now, most pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens do PCR testing and you get
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.360]   your results in a day or two.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.800]   You can also order an at-home kit from someone like Pixel or LabCorp and get
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.120]   results in a few days also.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:29.160]   Or, if you need results faster than that, there's a bunch of companies with same
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.280]   day and one day tests, one that I've found is Worksite Labs, which has testing
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.360]   locations around the country and they'll get your results in as little as one and
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.920]   a half hours for $250 or within 24 hours for $90.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.080]   Also, many international airports have onsite testing, but they're
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.440]   also really expensive.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:55.560]   For example, at SFO, you can get tested in under an hour, but it's $275.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.280]   So, once you're abroad, I really hope you just enjoy your travel and that the
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.600]   pandemic isn't an issue and you get to have an amazing trip, but you will need
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.560]   to get tested before you fly home, at least if you're coming back to the States.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.400]   So, if you want to get tested before you leave, I have two suggestions.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.440]   For me, I always bring the E-Med BinaxNOW tests that come with a video
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.680]   telehealth visit, which qualifies them for use to fly back into the U.S.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:26.160]   That way you can do the test wherever you are on your own time and know you'll get
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.360]   the results right away.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:33.720]   You can get one to three tests from Optum.com or six tests at E-Med.com.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.040]   And depending on how many you buy, they're $25 to $50 each.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.800]   Or if you don't want to deal with bringing your COVID tests with you, I would just
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.320]   reach out to the hotel concierge and ask them to help you coordinate
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.760]   getting tested before you leave.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.960]   Some resorts have free COVID pre-departure testing and others can just coordinate a
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.800]   nurse coming to your room for testing.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.640]   Okay, so hopefully that helps you have a safe and easy trip.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.160]   Wow, I really forgot how much I love doing these episodes, so I'm definitely
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.480]   going to try to do them more often.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.240]   Or I might even try to incorporate a few questions each week or even add a shorter
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.680]   second episode each week or every other week just focused on Q&A.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.200]   So, no matter what I do, please keep the questions coming.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.720]   I really love hearing from all of you and I hope this is able to
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   help you guys upgrade your lives.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:24.200]   If you enjoyed this episode or just enjoy the show, please consider sharing
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.560]   it with a friend or family member who might like it.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.280]   It is really the best way to help me grow the show.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.120]   And if you heard planes flying over in the background during this episode,
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.080]   I am so sorry, I live near SFO and it is raining outside and whenever that
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.920]   happens, they divert all the flights right over our house.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.760]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.720]   I'll see you next week.

[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.720]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.720]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast and it's much more about building
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.720]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.720]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.720]   entertaining.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.720]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.720]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.720]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   your money and grow your wealth.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.720]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.720]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
