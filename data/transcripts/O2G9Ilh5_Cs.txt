[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.600]   - Everyone, thank you for coming to our session.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.300]   This is part of the accumulators track.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.680]   I'm Karen D'Amato, and I am joined by a wonderful panel,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.700]   starting from my right.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.480]   Dan Egan is the Director of Behavioral Finance
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.560]   and Investing at Betterment.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560]   In his research, he focuses on understanding
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.720]   how our minds and our emotions work
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.160]   in order to help people make better decisions
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.980]   around their money and investing and spending.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.600]   Next, Nick Magiuli is the Chief Operating Officer
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.340]   and Data Scientist at Rittles Wealth Management.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.880]   He's the author of the blog of Dollars and Data,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.920]   and author of the recently published book,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.760]   Just Keep Buying, which he's supposed to be waving up now,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.860]   but you can't see it.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.240]   And he'll be just--
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.480]   - I have emotions. (Karen laughing)
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.720]   - And he'll be discussing the book tomorrow morning
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.040]   at 8.10, so set your alarms early for that one.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380]   And Randy Bruns is the Founder of Model Wealth
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.320]   and a Senior Financial Planner with the firm,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.300]   which serves consumers with hourly and flat fees.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.280]   And as an advisor, Randy works directly with clients
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.320]   who are widely varied in their ages
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.800]   and in their financial resources.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.000]   - Thank you all for being here.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I think the accumulator's audience is an interesting one
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.020]   because it can encompass people
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260]   from their 20s into their 60s.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.040]   Potentially, so an audience potentially
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.600]   of people at very different stages in their lives,
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.680]   different financial circumstances.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.760]   And I guess the place where I wanted to start
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.280]   is sort of with a big picture issue.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.620]   We all have lots of demands on our time
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.200]   and our attention.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   And so to set the stage, Nick,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.560]   I was hoping you could discuss your guidance
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.160]   on where people should focus.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800]   So thinking about, do I focus on my income,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.640]   my spending, saving, investing?
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.180]   How do I prioritize where I'm putting my energy
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.360]   around my personal finances?
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.920]   - Yeah, thanks, Karen.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.720]   Thanks for everyone coming out.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.280]   In terms of prioritizing time,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.720]   I mean, this is a Bogleheads meetup, right?
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.040]   So we all talk about investing
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.760]   and how much should I have international?
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   How do I rebalance?
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.080]   All those types of things.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.600]   And that's very relevant for the people
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.440]   in the other room, right?
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.240]   They've done most of their accumulating already.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.900]   Their money's already saved up.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.620]   They're trying to go through the next 20, 30 years,
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.000]   et cetera, of their life.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.840]   And all those little things matter a lot.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.960]   But for people in this room,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.040]   people are still accumulating,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.840]   or those especially younger,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.960]   it matters a lot less
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.360]   because you don't have all that money yet, right?
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.740]   So when I talk about, in the first chapter of my book,
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.560]   I kind of lay out this framework,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.000]   which I call the Save and Invest Continuum,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.440]   which basically, if you can save more money
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.560]   than your investments can earn you,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.680]   then you need to focus on that savings part.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.320]   And that's what this room is really about.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   And so when I talk about
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.280]   where you're gonna use your time, it's your income.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   It's like, that's everything.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.200]   I think that's something that's downplayed
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.640]   in most of the personal finance community
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.220]   is like income, income, income, it's everything, right?
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.060]   And so people talk about savings and things like that,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.520]   but I think you have to focus on growing your income.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.640]   And that's like the primary way to build wealth.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.960]   - And then that question of how much you're focusing on
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.200]   investing versus just finding those dollars to save.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.600]   I mean, we may have people in this room
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.680]   who have already accumulated a lot
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.280]   and they're still accumulating more.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.720]   So for them, the investing decisions
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.960]   do become more significant.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.800]   - Yeah, they'll start to become more significant
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.880]   as your investments can actually earn you more
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.240]   than you could save in a year.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.120]   And let's just use a simple example of this.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.800]   You know, if you have a million dollars saved up,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   you know, a 10% returns $100,000,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.000]   can you save 100,000 a year?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.960]   Maybe some people in this room can, right?
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.160]   But what happens if it's 10 million?
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.240]   Can you save a million in a year?
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.560]   Most people probably can't, right?
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.740]   So you see as that investment value gets higher,
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.520]   you start to have less and less control
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.880]   over what happens to your wealth, right?
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.660]   At least with your savings side.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.240]   So that's why I would say focus on income
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.200]   if you're especially just starting out.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.980]   - So I wanna think about my income.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.600]   I wanna think about getting money into savings.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.720]   But Dan, you were telling me that one thing
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.980]   I probably don't need to bother with
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.680]   is using one of those cool apps to track all my spending.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.560]   Like, why not?
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440]   That seems like it should help me.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.720]   - Yeah, so one of the more interesting elements
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.260]   of money management is how much time and effort
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.280]   you spend stressing about your money.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.940]   It's this perversity of, like, you think you own things,
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.120]   but actually if those things require time
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.480]   and concentration and effort, they kind of own you.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.840]   They own your attention.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.200]   And one of the traps people can fall into
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.360]   is thinking that budgeting is about looking
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.200]   in the rear view mirror at what I spent
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.080]   and being like, oh, I overspent on takeout last month.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.600]   Oh, I underspent on this.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.660]   There are, like, consistent studies that show, like,
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.920]   the more that you do that, you're not gonna save more.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.200]   You're gonna be unhappier because you're stressed
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.640]   about the fact that you're not doing better.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.960]   And there are constant sort of escalating benchmarks
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.240]   of if you did good last month,
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.000]   you should do even better this month.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   People who are very good at saving as a process
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.040]   tend to invert the usual thing.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.600]   They don't say, I'm gonna exert a lot of self-control
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.800]   and I will have saved money by the end of the month
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.440]   by not spending it.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.720]   There's lots of different ways of saying this.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.520]   Generally, pay yourself first,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.500]   which is effectively, I make two grand.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.420]   I know that I should be saving 500 of that when I get paid.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.340]   I'm gonna auto-deposit it into a savings account somewhere
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.660]   so that it's not even in my checking account to spend.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.100]   That sort of, like, top-down think about a budget
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.900]   at one point layout, very simple math,
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.260]   you know, like, one plus one plus one equals three.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.700]   I'm gonna save 1/3 of it.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.920]   Allows you to save systematically
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.620]   and in a way that doesn't stress you
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.180]   about what specifically you spent money on.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.640]   Your retirement doesn't care if you spent it on cappuccinos
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   or muscle cars or any other thing.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.600]   It's just a matter of how much money did you save.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.200]   The spending should not be something that causes you stress
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.900]   because you know you are saving enough from the outset.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.640]   - Thank you.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.440]   Let's talk a little bit about the investing environment
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.760]   we find ourselves in.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.360]   So it's a year when stocks and bonds have done terribly.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.640]   Inflation is high, it's scary.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.960]   The economic conditions are scary.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.220]   Bill Bernstein says that's a great market for accumulators,
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.820]   but he also said you don't know
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.500]   until you're in that bear market
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.060]   how awful it's going to feel.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.260]   So Randy, if you could talk to us about
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.180]   when you talk to potential clients
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.180]   about investing and investing in an environment like this,
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.820]   what are you talking to them about?
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.220]   How are you trying to get them to look at the world?
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.360]   - Well, you stole my quote from Bill Bernstein this morning
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.260]   and I paraphrased him on Twitter.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.780]   I said Bill Bernstein had said, "I would love it
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.840]   "if I were an accumulator, I'd love a market like this.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.580]   "I would drool over it," I think is the word he was using.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.320]   But, and it is true because if everybody in this room
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.540]   is an accumulator, volatility is good.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.040]   It helps you buy more shares mathematically.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   You end up paying a lower share price on average
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.700]   than the very same mutual funds
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.640]   or companies you're buying into.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.420]   But that still doesn't mean almost like a,
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.460]   something I've heard of is like you can take a,
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.120]   you can do a flight simulator, but,
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.800]   and have a good feel for what it's gonna feel like
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.900]   in a plane crash, but until you actually get
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.380]   into a plane crash, that can't simulate the feeling.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.220]   So what we do in our firm is we remind investors
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.380]   of their timeframe, but we also make sure they know
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.540]   not just how much they need to save,
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.480]   but also that there are going to be major bumps
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.020]   along the road, and we don't say,
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.840]   "Oh, if you're in an 80/20 portfolio
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.360]   "that has historically fallen as far as 37%,"
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   we actually put it in terms of dollars,
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.340]   and every meeting with our clients,
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.560]   we make sure we're the nag that says,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.380]   "Hey, here's how much value you could lose
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.240]   "if things go south," and then things do go south,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.880]   and they can't say we didn't warn them, and yeah.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.280]   - Dan, what are some lessons from behavioral finance
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.820]   that'll help us act more intelligently in this market?
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.840]   - So the first one that actually I'm gonna play off of,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.600]   which is distance and time.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.680]   Distance and time are very powerful assets in multiple ways,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.360]   and one of the most powerful is that when we are stressed,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.880]   when we are scared, we make worse decisions
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.700]   that are generally more short-termist.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.540]   We say, like, what do I need to deal with?
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.660]   Right now, I don't care about the long-term,
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.520]   I just wanna feel better in the short-term.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.900]   One of the unfair advantages
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.400]   that a lot of accumulators are gonna have
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.340]   is that they're gonna be looking ahead 10-plus years,
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.240]   and when I log in, I remember during March of 2020,
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.920]   when it was kind of like the trough
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.440]   of the pandemic-related drop,
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.560]   I logged in and looked at my retirement plan
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.680]   that consists of, like, okay, I'm gonna keep saving
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.440]   for this many more years
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.000]   into these account sites, et cetera,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.400]   and it said something absolutely horrifying,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.800]   like, you're gonna spend $300 less per month in retirement,
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.920]   and I was like, oh, never mind, okay, no problem.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.440]   I'm not stressed about that anymore.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.720]   The more that we can remove stress
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.880]   by using distance and time as buffers between ourselves,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.600]   the smarter decisions we make,
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.960]   and one way you can think about this is,
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.760]   Jeff Bezos has this quote that he's like,
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.200]   "If Amazon had a great quarter this quarter,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.080]   "it's because of decisions that we made three years ago."
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.520]   Like, when you are thinking about these things,
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.360]   the decisions you make today, they roll out,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.040]   they kind of get realized in terms of the outcomes
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.760]   years and years into the future,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.640]   and you realize that, you think,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.320]   I don't need to react to what's going on
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.200]   in markets right now, right?
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.700]   Like, we are planting trees.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.440]   These things take decades to grow effectively.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.280]   Stuff matters.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.400]   You need to come and attend to it.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.720]   You need to think about seasonality
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.440]   and what do I do in different seasons,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.600]   but give yourself that relaxation
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.020]   that, like, I should not be worried
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.360]   about this quarter to quarter
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.720]   because I am sticking to a plan
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.180]   that plays out over decades.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.120]   The more that we allow ourselves
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.840]   to have distance in time in how we make decisions,
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.520]   we make better decisions that play out better,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.960]   and we get to say, we made an awesome decision
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.960]   three years ago, and we're bearing the benefits of it today.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.760]   - I know, Nick, you were also saying
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.040]   you feel like people, one of the risks today
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   is that people are so focused on the short term,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.480]   which I think it feels natural.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.760]   I mean, we're always bombarded
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.200]   with so much news and information,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.520]   but when it's scary, I think it's,
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.880]   you pay a lot more attention to it
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.120]   than the days you look at the market
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.200]   and you say, oh, the market's up again.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.680]   Great, and you go on with your life
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.820]   as opposed to the market is down a lot today.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.580]   I'm gonna spend a little more time thinking about it.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.280]   Other tips for how I can
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:56.200]   resist that and keep my focus where it should be?
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.440]   - Yeah, I think just like studying history,
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.160]   you start to realize how much stuff repeats itself.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.300]   For example, recently, my sister and I went to Florence,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.960]   and I'm not just, it's not a brag, this is relevant,
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.600]   and they had these little thing called wine,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.000]   I know, 'cause I'm like, what the hell, yeah.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.640]   They had these little thing called wine windows
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.560]   that apparently during the Black Plague,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.960]   they used to sell wine and things
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   out of these little windows to prevent
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.040]   face-to-face contact with people during the Black Death,
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.520]   right, 'cause it took out like,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.520]   some cities took out 2/3 of their inhabitants,
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.760]   right, in Italy, it was really bad.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.360]   So during COVID, they started reusing the wine windows,
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.960]   right, so you see like, history repeats in very odd ways,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.560]   and just like, little things like that,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.000]   little stories you find out about stuff,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.920]   it's like, we're sitting here looking at like,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.560]   this ticker tape moving, and it like,
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.400]   really doesn't make that much of a difference, right.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.120]   And I really love Dan's answer about when he logged in
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.600]   in like, March 2020, and he looked and he said,
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.160]   oh, I just lost, you know, X hundred dollars a month
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   in retirement, and I think a really cool,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.360]   just easy way to think about that is like,
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.540]   for every $100 a month you wanna spend in retirement,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.720]   that's about $30,000 in principal, right,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.520]   using like, the 4% rule or something.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.080]   It's not perfect, just assume that for now,
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.640]   and just trust me on that, right.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.760]   So if that's true, if you're down, you know,
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.000]   $90,000 in your retirement account right now,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.960]   what did you really lose?
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.720]   You lost $300 a month in retirement.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.860]   So, and if you actually look at the retirement date
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.520]   on how people spend money in retirement,
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.680]   they don't actually, most people don't pull down principal,
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.000]   they just live off their income.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.560]   So it doesn't matter, it's actually kind of
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.640]   very interesting what I'll talk about,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.160]   I need to have much more money in retirement,
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.280]   this and that, everyone just lives off their income,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.440]   no matter what that income is.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.880]   Even the people that have no savings,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.480]   they just live off their social security, right.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.360]   So if you have some savings, you're ahead of them, right,
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.760]   and so you're just gonna live off whatever income you have.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.440]   Now I'm not saying it's gonna be a great retirement
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.400]   if you don't have a lot saved,
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.000]   but you're going to make it work
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.080]   like everyone else in America
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.480]   is currently making it work, right.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.080]   So that's one positive side.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.440]   - There's a key kind of insight here,
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.040]   which is when you start thinking about your balance
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.840]   like a score, like in a video game or something,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.280]   and that you just want your score to go up,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.400]   it puts you into a very bad place.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.240]   But when you convert it into what matters to you
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.040]   in your life, it's very easy to be de-stressed about it.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.760]   So again, March 2020, I worked for a fintech company,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.120]   markets were down, things were not good.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.960]   My wife said, "Hey, just so we're clear,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.920]   "if you get laid off, what happens?"
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.120]   And we had a very large emergency fund,
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.240]   and I was like, "At least over six to nine months,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.160]   "we don't have to worry about anything."
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.960]   That meant that I didn't stress at my job,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   I was able to focus on the income,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.040]   on doing what needed to be done.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.480]   It meant that I didn't think about
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.120]   taking money out of a retirement account
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.340]   where there might be tax penalties
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.720]   and I can't put it back in.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.480]   So the only other thing is think about setting yourself up.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.120]   If you're worried about markets, think about why.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.720]   Does it actually affect anything other
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.380]   than looking at a score and making you feel good?
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.840]   Or is there an impact to your life?
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.920]   And if there is an impact to your life,
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.520]   how can you hedge that or immunize it?
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.300]   How do you make it so that you don't care what markets do?
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.120]   'Cause if you care what markets do,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.880]   and it's not just 'cause it's a score,
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.520]   you're in a risky position and you wanna focus on that
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.880]   as almost a financial planning thing to do.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.120]   How do I not care about markets?
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.960]   - So I appreciate your point about the emergency fund.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.880]   Part of what it is buffering me from
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.080]   is making a short-term decision
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.480]   that might not be the right one for the long-term.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.240]   I feel like emergency funds,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.280]   that's one of the pieces of advice you always hear,
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.360]   and I think there are a lot of people who don't do that.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.240]   So how much of an emergency fund
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.920]   do you recommend people have and where do you put it?
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.960]   And I'm just wondering if we're all in agreement here
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.000]   on the magnitude of that.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.320]   - So studying for the CFP exam,
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.560]   I always remember they said,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.840]   have somewhere between three to six months of spending
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.560]   in an emergency fund.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.800]   And it would be six months
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.840]   if it was just one sole income earner
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.640]   or one of the earners had less than stable income.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.440]   But we would typically recommend three to six months.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.160]   In most cases, we would definitely put it in
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.520]   like the highest FDIC-insured savings account
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.560]   you can find that's still accessible.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.080]   I personally have my checking account through Chase Bank,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.000]   which is a phenomenal bank if you live in the Chicago area,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.920]   but it's horrible when it comes to the interest rates
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.120]   they pay on savings, almost offensive.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.760]   So I chose Ally for its online savings account,
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.280]   and don't wait for a Chase banker to remind you of this,
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.200]   but you can actually link external accounts
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.960]   where I don't even go to Ally anymore.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.880]   I just go to Chase to move money in
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.800]   or out to Ally back and forth.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   But I also think having an emergency reserve
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.720]   plays into your risk tolerance during tough times,
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.680]   because we can look at our investors and our clients
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.760]   and say, you have to spend through this
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.760]   before you'd even get to that.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.320]   And so if somebody has afforded themselves
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.600]   a lower required return,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.080]   we would agree if they need a bigger savings account,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.400]   because the savings account at the end of the day
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.720]   is just going to follow inflation.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.520]   You're not going to beat inflation.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.200]   But if they've afforded themselves the ability
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.880]   to have an overabundance of recommended cash and savings,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.360]   if that allows them the peace of mind
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   to ride out a down year like this, we're all for it.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:11.000]   - So yeah, the only thing on emergency fund,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.840]   I agree with that.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.320]   I think it's also very individualized.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.640]   Every person's different.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.800]   I'm guessing many of you know Morgan Housel,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.320]   psychology of money, he wrote the book.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.600]   He's 25% cash and he's been like this
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.480]   before he had a bestselling book, like he was 25% cash.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.280]   So it's like, and he's like, I sleep great at night.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.400]   I'm never going to change that.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.680]   So I think that's way too high of an allocation personally,
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.320]   but that's, everyone's each their own.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.880]   So don't feel bad if you have like,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.640]   oh, I want to have two years of emergency cash.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.000]   Like, I think Bill Gates,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.200]   when he was running Microsoft early,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.400]   had at least what, 12 months or 24 months of cash,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.520]   you know, when he was running the company.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.360]   He's like, I want to be able to say
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.680]   if we got no more money coming in the door,
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.800]   I can pay my employees for at least a year or so.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.480]   So like, there's different ways of thinking
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.520]   about risk management, but yeah.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.000]   - So when we look at the people
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.600]   who are attending the conference, if you're here,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.640]   you are probably pretty darn serious about investing,
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.120]   about thinking about your personal finances,
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.800]   about saving in your 401k and doing other things
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.560]   you know you should looking ahead to the longterm.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.800]   Randy, what are some of the things
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   that people may be less likely to focus on
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.480]   because they're awkward and painful
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.680]   and difficult to even talk about?
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.400]   - I love this question because it's one thing
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.960]   to build a financial plan
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.440]   based on everything going as expected,
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.000]   but then something doesn't go as expected.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.120]   And this might be an estate plan for a young family
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.640]   or even if you don't have kids yet,
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.800]   you should, everybody, every adult
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   should have an estate plan
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.120]   just to know who makes your health decisions.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.200]   If God forbid you end up in a hospital
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.920]   or who manages your finances
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.360]   if God forbid you end up in a hospital.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.920]   Having term life insurance in place,
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.440]   whether it's before you have children
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.720]   or if you ever plan to have anybody dependent
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.200]   on your income, get a term life insurance policy
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.880]   immediately while you're healthy.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.960]   Long-term disability.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.920]   It's all based on, everything in accumulation
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.560]   is based on your ability to save,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.800]   which starts with your ability to earn an income.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.720]   And if you suddenly can't earn an income,
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   as I learned in March of 2020, day one of COVID,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.200]   I thought I had COVID.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.160]   I ended up collapsing in the shower.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.760]   My wife drove me to the, or my wife drove me,
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.000]   the ambulance took me to the hospital
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and I found out like, I was in the hospital all day long.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   I found out at about 4.30 that night
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.680]   that I had a tumor on my brain.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.160]   And because it was day one of COVID,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.000]   I couldn't go home.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.840]   They said, we don't know
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.080]   what the hospital is gonna look like.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.480]   If you're even gonna be back in here,
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.720]   we would suggest you get it removed immediately.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.560]   So that was Thursday, March 12th, day one of COVID.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.600]   And on Saturday, March 14th, I had surgery.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.960]   So, and if I didn't have Alex here,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.880]   who's my partner at the office,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.560]   he pretty much saved our practice
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.600]   from what could have been financial ruin
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.760]   just because it's not like COVID just hit
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.920]   and everything else was a breeze,
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.520]   but the stock market fell 30 plus percent
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.120]   that sharp period of time.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.400]   And if I didn't have a long-term
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.560]   disability insurance policy in place,
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.120]   I would have had to sell,
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.320]   or didn't have a savings account in place,
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.920]   I would have had to sell from assets
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.040]   that were sharply down in value
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.880]   and they wouldn't have been there
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.200]   for the ensuing recovery,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   which is everybody in this room knows was extremely sharp.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   So, we are professional nags at making sure
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.800]   that those areas like having an emergency savings,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.120]   having a term life insurance,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.960]   getting an estate plan,
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.760]   and having long-term disability insurance,
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.040]   which most employers provide,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.080]   those are the things that are very easy to overlook
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.040]   and say, well, it'll never happen to me.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.680]   I mean, I'm not gonna say I knew,
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.760]   I didn't own long-term disability insurance
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.200]   because I knew for some reason
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.080]   I was gonna get a brain tumor,
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.440]   but I knew the financial implications
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.000]   of something like that so catastrophic happening.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.120]   - Yeah, I was just thinking as you were saying that,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.840]   and I have to say thank you for sharing that.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.560]   Obviously, that really brings home
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.680]   the things that can happen to any of us so suddenly,
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.600]   and that is why we make plans.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.760]   But I was also just thinking,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.880]   when talking about estate planning,
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.080]   that is a phrase that has a bad name
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.160]   because you think, well, it's about estate planning,
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.920]   it's about dying, so I'm not gonna think about it,
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.960]   and I'm not gonna die right now, I'm young.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.960]   But if you go to an estate plan
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.520]   or all those other documents,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.680]   the healthcare proxy, the living will,
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.520]   your powers of attorney, I mean,
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.200]   those are not about when you're dying,
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.120]   they're about now if something happens to you
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.840]   and you were temporarily incapacitated.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.800]   And so I think if we thought about it
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.040]   as like critical legal documents
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.000]   as opposed to just estate planning,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.080]   maybe a few more people would focus on it.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.880]   - Dan, I wanted to ask you from--
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.280]   - Hey, Karen. - Yes.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.160]   - So one last thing on the estate plan.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.400]   So I have an almost six-year-old and a four-year-old
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.360]   that, like, my wife and I got an estate plan
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   because we didn't know, if we didn't have an estate plan,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.360]   who would raise these kids if we weren't around?
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.600]   I have two brothers, she has two sisters.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.760]   I don't trust either of my brothers to raise my kids.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.440]   Her older sister, not a chance.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   But her younger sister is the greatest person ever
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.680]   to raise our two kids and her fiance,
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.720]   but they're not great with money.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.980]   And so the person that you name
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.440]   as a guardian for your children
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.600]   may not be the person who you appoint
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.800]   as somebody who is the guardian of your finances, basically.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.980]   - And there are benefits, also,
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.400]   just from a separation of powers, checks and balances,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.720]   to having those be different people, I think, too.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.480]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.520]   - Dan, are there lessons from behavioral finance
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.600]   that would help me, any of us,
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.240]   actually carry through on all these things
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.680]   that we need to do?
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.160]   You know, the things that are sort of fun to focus on
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.600]   in personal finance and the things that are just chores,
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.340]   what can I do to help myself get everything done?
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.880]   - Well, there are great things.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.700]   So my favorite is what's called temptation bundling,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.440]   which is that, and I started doing this
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.560]   before I knew there was a term for it.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.440]   When I was in college, I would go into the library
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.520]   when I had to study for a test,
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.420]   and on the way in, I would buy myself
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.000]   four York peppermint patties.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.560]   And I'm allowed a York, I put them in front of me,
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.600]   and I was allowed one of them
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.240]   once I had studied for 45 minutes.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.120]   I didn't smoke cigarettes, but I would go outside
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.960]   and I would eat a York peppermint patty.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.380]   It was exactly like the commercial, so refreshing.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   So it's been simple, but set this up
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.200]   so that it is bundled with a reward.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.240]   Me and my wife have a thing,
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.720]   we have it regularly in the calendar.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.920]   We usually have date nights,
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.380]   and I think it's like once a quarter.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.120]   We have admin night, and we go out and we have a beer
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.640]   and we look at spreadsheets together
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.400]   and we talk about what's right, what's not right.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.000]   Are we thinking about everything okay?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.720]   And that night is a nice thing because at the end of it,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.900]   I'm allowed to go to the really fancy,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.380]   silly hipster cocktail bar and get a nice drink
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.720]   and say I've done my job, now I get a reward for it.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.340]   Use technology for planning it out, doing it regularly.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.800]   If you're thinking about it, if you're doing it ad hoc,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.760]   I'm probably not gonna do it, but when I have number one,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.200]   it in the calendar and in the calendar with someone else,
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.120]   we can go do it together.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.800]   You can do this even if it's, you know,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.260]   you're not gonna go to the bar
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.880]   and go over finances with your buddy,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.760]   but you can both go to the bar and say
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.600]   we're gonna do this thing,
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.440]   and at the end of it we'll be able to chat.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   Do it with somebody else.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.120]   Make it something that's a recurring activity
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.200]   with somebody else so that you kind of
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.720]   hold each other accountable, just like going to the gym.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.320]   - Thank you.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.560]   Thinking about bundling,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.880]   not quite York peppermint patties, maybe.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.220]   Nick, tell us about your, is it the two times rule?
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.300]   Do I have that right?
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.300]   - It's the two X rule, but basically,
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.260]   I think this is really relevant for bogleheads
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.980]   because I was just having lunch with some people I met,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.660]   and the big problem for all of us is,
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.600]   you know, we talk about, you know,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.980]   most Americans don't have $400 to meet,
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.820]   you know, some random expense, right?
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.340]   That's not the problem for people in this room,
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.620]   people in that room, right?
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.220]   It's, for most of us, it's gonna be like
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.940]   spending down our money, and so I think the real issue
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.180]   and the stuff I kind of write about is like, you know,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.000]   people are disciplined or saving money over time,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.640]   it's like, how do you spend money without guilt?
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.720]   And a lot of people,
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.520]   especially if you're really good at saving,
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.040]   you're by definition, probably not great at spending.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.240]   I mean, all is equal, right?
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.680]   So the question is, how can we get over that guilt?
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.840]   And there's a lot of different ways to do it.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.800]   One rule I came up with is like, I call it the two X rule.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   So if you wanna go splurge on something,
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.400]   you feel bad about that, like, you know,
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.600]   let's say it's gonna cost, you know,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.920]   let's say you wanna take yourself out to dinner,
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.800]   you're gonna go out to dinner, you're gonna spend like $400,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.960]   you're gonna spend like a lot of money,
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.480]   like a really, you're gonna buy a nice bottle of wine,
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.300]   whatever you're gonna do, right?
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.380]   You should save another 400, two X,
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.940]   and take that other 400 and invest it in something,
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.340]   you know, S&P 500 index,
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.660]   or income producing assets of some other sort,
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.460]   or you could even donate the other 400.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.740]   If you feel like, oh, I'm gonna spend it
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.580]   instead of being selfish and just thinking about myself,
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.580]   I'll donate the other 400.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.560]   So it's these little simple rules.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.460]   I mean, they're not anything crazy.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.400]   I have no data that shows that they work,
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.580]   so I can't really back that,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.780]   but all I can say is like,
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.980]   it's these little heuristics that I like to use,
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.720]   and I know other people have found useful
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.660]   if you're trying to spend money.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.380]   So I'm just trying to get rid of spending guilt,
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.420]   'cause I think there's a lot of people
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.580]   that have a lot of guilt around spending money,
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.700]   especially in this community
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.740]   where we're very good at accumulating, obviously.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.900]   - We're very good at guilt.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.260]   (laughing)
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.420]   - This is very true.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.780]   Nick said it in passing earlier,
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.700]   but I think it's worth coming back to.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.900]   The vast majority of retirees
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.340]   don't spend down their balance
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.180]   'cause it feels bad to see it going down.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.580]   Vanguard actually has, I believe it's called
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.820]   a managed payout fund.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.140]   That's a fund that's meant to act like an annuity.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.340]   You are meant to spend whatever payments you get from it,
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.740]   and people take those payments
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.980]   and they reinvest about 25% of them back into the fund,
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.020]   which is extremely frustrating for the fund manager
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.060]   who's like, you are using my product wrong.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.460]   Why are you doing this to me?
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.500]   I don't want inflows.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.980]   Stop it.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.440]   One of the things that we've seen,
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.540]   so this is not a plug, it's just an explanation.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.980]   At Betterment, you can use goals.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.340]   You can say like, this is the thing that I want for this.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.420]   This is my vacation fund.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.660]   This is my nice new car fund,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.980]   or a goal or whatever it is.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.940]   And bookmarking things is like,
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.980]   this is the purpose of this money
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.340]   does a great deal to remove this kind of guilt
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.040]   because it's like, I saved up for,
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.500]   a really common one is a Tesla, for some reason.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.560]   And it's like, I saved up for the Tesla,
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.260]   and now I have all this money,
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.340]   but it's in the Tesla.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.400]   The entire purpose of this money
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.380]   is to fulfill this real life thing.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.300]   It's not to just have the balance go up.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.780]   And so, do it however you want.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.540]   Set up a whole bunch of different savings accounts,
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.780]   whatever it is, it's a pain in the butt logistically,
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.780]   but put labels on things.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.660]   So you say like, when I spend this,
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.500]   it's not gonna feel bad
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.740]   because the entire purpose of this account
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.400]   was my 10 year anniversary trip to wherever.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.140]   - And Randy, how do you handle that with clients
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.700]   when clients are saving for multiple goals?
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.380]   They're saving for buying a house,
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.060]   they're saving for college,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.580]   they're saving for retirement,
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.860]   they're saving for the home addition they're planning.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.340]   How do you recommend that they manage that?
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.980]   - So what we do is we make sure
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.740]   that their emergency reserve is covered.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.980]   And then we also make sure
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.900]   that they're putting away enough for retirement,
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.500]   and it's in very simple, low cost investments.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.860]   But I remember one particular client who was,
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.900]   she was probably 31 at the time,
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.580]   but she was gonna buy a home in the next five years.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.580]   And we made it very clear to her
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.580]   that the growth of the portfolio is not so important,
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.260]   anywhere near as important as the confidence you can have
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.660]   that those funds will be available in five years.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.220]   And Nick, I think you mentioned this in your book, right?
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.220]   Here's a plug, a shameless plug for Nick's book.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.540]   But anyways, like, it was five years down the road,
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.660]   she was putting money in on a monthly basis.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.860]   And we, it also wasn't like something
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.860]   that she was dead set on, it has to be bought in five years.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.420]   So she had some wiggle room,
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.020]   but we just, she was putting money in on a monthly basis.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.620]   We recommended the Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.540]   But if it was something that they were going to use
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.460]   within two years, or even less than three years,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.580]   we would quantify the value of it,
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.940]   work the math backward, assume a 0%,
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.940]   if not a negative 1% or negative 2% return
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.060]   relative to inflation,
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.260]   because that's the cost of short-term safety and liquidity.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.300]   And then we just make sure
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.000]   that they manage to that goal, basically.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.580]   - One of the things I want to talk to you about,
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.180]   sort of the flip side of feeling so guilty
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.760]   that you don't actually spend, is lifestyle creep.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.500]   You know, the shared apartments and the hostels
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.700]   on vacation are great when you're in your 20s,
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.020]   but at some point down the road,
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.740]   you probably want to use your raises to have a bigger house,
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.420]   live in a different lifestyle.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:12.420]   How do I figure out if I'm in a comfortable place,
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.340]   not spending too much?
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.840]   I mean, how do I make sure
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.100]   I don't let my lifestyle get out of hand?
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:27.860]   - So, I think a lot of personal finance experts,
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.840]   especially in, you know, Boglehead's community,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.940]   may say things like, you know,
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.500]   oh, we don't want your lifestyle to creep,
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.140]   just save all your raises, et cetera.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.460]   I actually wanted to test that,
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.460]   so I've written a blog post about this,
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.820]   it's in the book as well.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.300]   Basically, long story short,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.860]   you have to save like half of your raises, more or less.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.780]   And actually, for people who have a very high savings rate,
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.020]   you actually have to save more of your raises
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.620]   to kind of end up at the same place, right?
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.100]   You can imagine someone in equilibrium,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.940]   imagine you're saving now,
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.580]   you know you're gonna retire at 65,
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.580]   you're saving whatever you're saving, right?
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.260]   And then you get this positive shock to your income,
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.380]   you'll get a raise, it's a good thing, right?
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.040]   If you want to spend the same amount of money
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.940]   through the rest of your life and in retirement, right?
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.080]   Remember, you're already on your equilibrium path.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.180]   The question is, when you get that extra money,
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.060]   if you spend it all now, when you hit retirement,
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.980]   you have to drop your spending again, right?
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.180]   So you can imagine that already.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.900]   So the question is, you always have to spend less of it
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.060]   to kind of, you can raise your lifestyle a little bit,
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.140]   but then you can save the rest
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.380]   and you can still retire at the same date, right?
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.100]   'Cause if you spend all of it, or more than all of it,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.060]   you'll have to retire later.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.500]   You can just think about that logically.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.420]   But long story short, basically,
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.540]   if you run all these simulations,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.540]   different savings rates and all this,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.020]   you have to save basically half your raises,
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.140]   which ironically fits really well with the 2X rule,
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.340]   so it's easy to remember.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.580]   I did, the math just panned out that way.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.860]   I did not plan on that.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.140]   But yeah, so that's what I would say.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:45.980]   Like, I've looked at it,
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.460]   and I think you can do like half your,
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.940]   so if you get a raise after a tax income of $1,000,
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.380]   you can spend an extra $500 a month, enjoy that,
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.780]   but you have to save the other 500
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.420]   to stay on track to whatever path you're on.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.020]   So, I don't know if anyone wants that.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:30:59.860]   - The only thing I'd throw in there
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.340]   is that there's a sort of,
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.500]   if you go hard in the early parts of your career,
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.460]   you can have a really easy latter part of it.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.180]   Meaning, if you do like 75% of every raise
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.460]   up until the time you hit like 32, 33,
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.060]   number one, all that money's going into the market earlier,
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.380]   more time to grow, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.100]   It also keeps your lifestyle low
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.460]   up until that point in time.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.500]   Generally, right around then
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.660]   is when you are at very, very high risk
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.700]   for a certain set of liabilities called a family.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.220]   And your ability to save escalates
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.260]   without your ability to control it.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.860]   And you're like, how did afterschool cost this much?
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.940]   Why does this happen?
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.340]   But once you, like, if you go hard in the beginning,
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.020]   all of a sudden you'll find yourself in this middle zone,
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.340]   you'll spend money on family,
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.980]   you'll come out of it, let's say 18, 20 years later.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.860]   You'll feel okay, and you'll know then
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.340]   that like because you went hard early,
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.180]   you have an easy life now.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.020]   And you can adjust them.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.860]   That's the thing.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.220]   You're giving yourself the option to say,
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.860]   I'm not gonna be stressed
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.580]   when I come out of the family liability situation.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.580]   If you go into it stressed,
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.060]   you're probably gonna come out of it stressed.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.340]   You can always adjust later easily
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.940]   to say, like, I'm gonna spend more money
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.900]   'cause I have too much.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.180]   That's a very good problem to have.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.100]   The other way is not a very good problem to have.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.660]   So go hard when you're younger.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.860]   It'll make later life easier.
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.940]   - Most people, when they say that,
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.100]   they're not actually talking about saving, but.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.700]   (laughing)
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.900]   - Sure.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.300]   - Let's talk a little bit about real estate
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.140]   and home ownership.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.580]   Because you will have people in the accumulator stage
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.340]   who may be making that first home purchase.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.100]   What do you advise people
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.860]   in looking at the real estate market?
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.820]   How do I decide if this is the time to buy
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.060]   and how do I do it smartly?
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:52.460]   - So one of the biggest things here, I think,
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.180]   is try and figure out where your private values
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.460]   most diverge from public values.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.900]   By which I mean you are investing in something
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.420]   that is your home.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.020]   You will live in this thing.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.340]   It is where you will spend most of your non-waking hours
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.580]   and a fair share of your waking hours.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.740]   The important thing, everybody,
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.060]   there's a common price for a house.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.580]   It's like, how much is this price worth?
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.740]   That's what it's worth to some sort of median person.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.220]   You will find the best house for you
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.260]   by thinking about how am I different than most people?
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.380]   How am I different than the median person?
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.060]   What matters to me that doesn't matter to them
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.820]   and what doesn't matter to me that does matter to them?
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.960]   Real quick example, the apartment that me and my wife
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.220]   ended up with is not near a subway in New York City.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.060]   That is fine.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:36.900]   We love biking.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.820]   We live near the river.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.260]   We're able to come up and say,
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.860]   there's a lot of stuff about this apartment.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.920]   It doesn't have a washer-dryer in it.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.940]   That's not a problem for us.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.780]   When you're looking at a home,
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.500]   the most important thing is, again, to say,
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.980]   this is my house.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.740]   Let me try and go out and find a house
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.660]   that is most undervalued, to me, in the market.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.740]   And that means looking at a house
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.780]   that is gonna be not cookie-cutter,
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.500]   not sort of conventional in some way.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.820]   It should be different, and that different
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.100]   is gonna be right for you.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.460]   - Yeah, I love that answer.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.300]   Only thing I'd add is, I actually don't think
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.180]   it's as much of a, trust me, it's a huge financial decision,
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.900]   but I think it's much more of a personal decision.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.860]   Like, is this the right time for me to do this?
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.100]   Should I be, you know, is your professional life
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.380]   kind of settled or mostly settled,
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.740]   and is your personal life settled, right?
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.660]   If you're single, do you wanna be buying a house
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.980]   to then sell it in a couple of years
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.340]   and then have to go out and buy another one, right?
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.140]   It's just, you don't wanna pay those transaction costs,
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.020]   right, it's usually like, what, 6%,
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.660]   I mean, when you include all the fees and everything.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.580]   So, that's the one thing I would say there.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.260]   And in terms of right now with how things are,
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.420]   with rates as high as they are,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.700]   so like, payments are a lot higher,
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.940]   so unless home prices come down,
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.220]   you're not gonna be able to get the same payment
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.180]   that you could've got a year ago
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.900]   for the same size house, right?
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.300]   So, it's gonna be interesting to see
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.780]   what happens in the next year.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:52.500]   - And I can say, I agree that if you buy a house,
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.140]   you don't buy it for financial reasons.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.100]   You buy it because you want to plant your roots there.
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.180]   I specifically, and my wife specifically,
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.620]   we're looking for a tall trees, fat squirrels neighborhood
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.380]   that looks like it had been there a long time.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.100]   Our house is 103 years old,
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.580]   which brings up a whole other set of issues.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.900]   But these issues, so, and this is gonna tie back
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.980]   to the emergency reserve or just having cash on hand,
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.220]   we finally decided to replace seven windows in our house,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.780]   and they cost, everybody knows,
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.860]   windows are ridiculously expensive.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.260]   So, it cost us $18,000,
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.700]   which we had prepared for,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.900]   but what we did not prepare for was our AC unit
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.860]   going out on the hottest day of August that year,
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.140]   and then our hot water,
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.900]   our tankless hot water heater went out.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:43.020]   So, we altogether, that was a $29,000 burden
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.700]   that we, 18,000 of which we planned for,
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.180]   29, the extra 11,000 we did not plan for,
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.260]   but we had a buffer.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.860]   So, and that's something that, an example we use with,
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.300]   we have an individual that,
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.020]   a couple that we worked with a few years ago,
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.420]   who only one of them was working,
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.980]   they were living, they were renting,
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.940]   and they just felt like,
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.540]   they were 31 and 30 years old,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.220]   and they just wanted to no longer rent,
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.740]   and we said, "Well, why?"
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.940]   So, first of all, they didn't have any savings.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.340]   They woulda had, she was a veterinarian's technician
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.900]   or whatever, she would qualify for a doctor's loan,
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.960]   which allowed her to put only like, you know,
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.940]   however much down, a very small down payment,
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.320]   and then she didn't have to pay private mortgage insurance,
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.180]   and we just said, "No, do not do that.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.720]   "What if your furnace breaks?"
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.340]   So, we talked them out of it, thankfully,
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.100]   but that's a big, big concern, too.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.580]   Renting is fine.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.980]   - I have one more thing that I think's interesting,
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.980]   and nobody thinks about it the right way.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.420]   You generally don't wanna be
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.400]   the least well-off person in your neighborhood.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.940]   You will be unhappy there,
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.980]   'cause you will be constantly comparing yourself
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.080]   to your neighbors.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.180]   It's tricky, 'cause that's usually associated with,
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.620]   but I wanna get my kid into the good school,
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.520]   something like that, there are other factors,
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.240]   but do you think about, like,
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.340]   the neighborhood that I am buying a house in,
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.200]   am I gonna feel good living here,
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.900]   or am I gonna feel unwelcome,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.700]   or like I am not as, you know, I'm not spending as much,
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.800]   and like, just drive around.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.220]   What kind of cars are people,
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.540]   are they displaying their cars out there?
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.460]   You know, like, what do the houses look like?
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.260]   Being aware of what it's gonna feel like
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.700]   to live in a neighborhood in terms of what the houses,
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.980]   and it feels like money-wise, is actually important.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.340]   Be at the upper end of that, not the lower end.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.140]   - Because also, if you're at the lower end,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.900]   and you are very aware of that, that's another thing,
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.340]   that's the other lifestyle creep pressure,
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.500]   and it's not even fun, it's that pressure
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.380]   to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.220]   - Absolutely.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.060]   - One thing we haven't talked about yet is debt.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.420]   So there will be some people in the Accumulator audience
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.500]   who may be early in their careers,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.780]   may actually be earning substantial salaries,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.420]   but are starting from a point of having significant debt,
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.260]   as well, from their education.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.940]   Randy, how do you work with those clients,
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.540]   and what are some of their particular issues?
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.340]   - Well, so being an hourly-based firm,
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.380]   we do cater to a lot of recent college graduates
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.820]   who are buried in college debt,
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.620]   still haven't saved up for a sufficient amount
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.860]   in an emergency reserve.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.500]   They want to save for a down payment on a house.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.980]   They also are, you know, they wanna save for retirement
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.620]   because what's the most precious commodity
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.260]   that any young saver has,
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.140]   versus everybody in that room, is time.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.020]   So I think we help people prioritize,
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.540]   and definitely if you have high-interest credit card debt,
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:49.380]   if you're paying 19%, that's not doing any good.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.420]   So pay off the credit cards first.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.460]   But I'd say, like, the debt pay down
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.220]   versus saving for a down payment on a new home,
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.740]   and then we have, like, with student loan forgiveness,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.500]   I think that's a pretty complex answer
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.660]   that's gonna be very specific to each individual,
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.580]   but we would prioritize at least saving
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.420]   to your 401(k) up to the company match,
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.500]   and then pay off any high credit card debt,
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.060]   because again, paying interest in the teens is,
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.660]   I mean, it's basically getting a 15% return
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.480]   once that's down, or paid off.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.100]   But I don't have a specific answer,
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.220]   because everything we do is very much case study
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.220]   specific to each individual.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.060]   - Got it.
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.100]   I think we'll take a moment now
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.420]   and see if people in the audience have questions
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.940]   they'd like to ask the panelists.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.660]   I'll bring our microphone down,
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.820]   or I'll let Rick bring the microphone down.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.540]   (microphone thuds)
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:40:05.620]   - Thank you all.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.100]   I've got a question that might be a bit of a math-ma
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.580]   to the crowd here, but what are your thoughts
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:15.580]   of sort of platforms like SeedInvest, WeFunder,
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.900]   that allow people to invest small amounts of money
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.740]   into private companies, and also the proliferation
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.640]   of ads, at least, of fractional art, fractional cars,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.940]   and all that kind of stuff as an asset class?
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.980]   - So I've done some of these things.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.340]   I've done something with WeFunder,
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.340]   and I've also, I do own some art.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.260]   I have a partnership with them,
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.780]   so I will not mention the name of the company,
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.980]   but you can probably guess who it is.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.580]   So I think that should be a very small portion
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.420]   of your portfolio.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.100]   I think like 90% of your assets
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.380]   should be in income-producing assets.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.140]   I don't see art, or wine, or crypto, or gold
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.180]   as income-producing, because there's no cash flows.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.140]   And so because of that, even WeFunder,
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.300]   which is private companies, you're like,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.260]   well, that's a business, isn't that cash-flow producing?
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.700]   Well, right now it probably isn't,
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.860]   so I would say for all practical purposes,
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.540]   those are like the high-risk, like non-income-producing.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.860]   I keep that 10% of my portfolio.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.780]   I don't know what other people do,
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.540]   but that's just kind of how I look at it.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.780]   I think those are sometimes,
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.660]   they're actually hobbies masquerading as investments,
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.580]   and I think I expect to lose money on my hobbies.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.860]   I spend money on equipment.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.900]   I spend money on fees of various kinds.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.340]   I love it, it's worth it, I'm gonna do it anyway,
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.580]   but I don't expect to make money on my rock climbing.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.860]   And I think a lot of that's similar.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.900]   Like enjoy it, get into the community.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.100]   This is your spare time.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.420]   Don't expect to make money on it, just enjoy it.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.420]   - Thank you.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:42.580]   - I had a question about estate planning.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.540]   It's something I always know I need to do,
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.460]   but I've always postponed it because in my mind,
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.900]   I'm thinking, okay, if I don't have at least two million
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.420]   or three million, do I really want to do estate planning?
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.620]   So I guess my question is, is there really the right time
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.300]   when you should be doing estate planning,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.020]   and is there really a certain threshold or dollar amount
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.780]   that it makes sense to start doing estate planning?
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.820]   - I can't say much about dollar.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.660]   I'm gonna hand it off to you.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.300]   There's one, me and my wife said, oh my God, we have a kid.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.420]   We need to have this done just so it's clear
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.620]   what's going on.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.620]   The worst thing you can do to a spouse or a significant other
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.340]   is to have them deal with the loss of you
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.720]   and all this stuff at the same time.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.340]   And I've seen that play out multiple times.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.320]   So just if somebody else is effectively dependent
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.060]   on you in some fashion, or it's gonna be a big pain
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.260]   in the butt to deal with, do it ahead of time.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.760]   Again, when you're cool and calm and collected,
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.340]   it's a lot better way to do it.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.940]   We used a site online called Trust and Will,
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.080]   and I think it's just trustandwill.com.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.500]   It was fantastic.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.320]   It was like easy to get through.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.500]   We don't have an estate.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.440]   We don't have, we're not landed gentry,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.820]   but it was very good for like the 98%.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:54.320]   - I'll reference the CFP exam,
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.940]   which I took, shoot, probably 12 years ago.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.380]   But there was one question, and Alex,
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.340]   you had it on your exam too.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.820]   They gave just like four just insane things
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.420]   that no prudent investor or consumer would ever do.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.700]   It said like, oh, this person has $30,000
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.620]   in credit card debt.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.380]   All of their retirement's tied up in one stock.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.140]   They have no savings account,
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.380]   and they don't have an estate plan.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.980]   What should this person do?
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.900]   And in the practice exams, I said, oh, you know what?
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.060]   They should pay off the credit card debt, you know,
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.340]   whatever, or I can't remember.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.660]   But the answer was get an estate plan
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.500]   because you never, like Dan just said,
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.620]   you never want to be a burden to somebody else.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.280]   And even if you don't have any assets,
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.940]   or you don't feel like you have $2 million as you said,
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.100]   well, who is going to make the decisions
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.820]   if God forbid you end up in a hospital
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.340]   and somebody has to determine,
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:46.180]   do we pull the plug on this person or, you know,
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.140]   give her treatment?
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.340]   So it's not, the nice thing about not having
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.180]   a complex estate means you're not going to pay
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.860]   that much for a good estate plan.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:03.800]   - So I think that question is appropriate
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.180]   given my circumstances.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.540]   I've been widowed for eight years.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.420]   My husband dropped dead on me.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.900]   And I would say that that advice,
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.620]   I would hope that everybody takes that to heart
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.580]   because had he not had that in place,
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.740]   I think it would have been considerably worse
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.260]   than my situation is.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.980]   I have a two-year-old and a six-year-old
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.740]   when he died, and now they're 10 and 15.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.980]   So we're still trying to, you know,
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   make our way through things.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.140]   I had two comments.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:34.140]   One of them was, this is a very male heavy crowd here
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:38.060]   and there, make sure that your partners
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.300]   are aware of where your money is.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.820]   The greatest thing my husband did for me
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.020]   was teaching me about where, you know,
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.220]   keeping track of the money,
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.380]   keeping track of the accounts, all that stuff.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.780]   We didn't have like the big book
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.980]   that the Bogleheads talk about,
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:56.980]   but I had everything in Quicken.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.100]   So when he died and two months later,
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.020]   I had to file taxes.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.100]   I filed taxes in two hours
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.140]   because everything was right there.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.900]   The next year, it was a mess.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.020]   But so I would say, at a minimum,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.060]   even if your spouses are not really into it,
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.860]   the chances are, you're gonna, you know,
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.460]   men are gonna die before women.
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.620]   And, you know, to the extent that you can encourage
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.860]   your partners to at least know a little bit
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.340]   about where your puts and takes are,
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.620]   that's super helpful, as I can attest.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.860]   One suggestion I just came to my mind was,
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:33.580]   when you have a power of attorney for your finances,
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.900]   consider, something that I did,
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.620]   having it be valid right now.
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.020]   And because when I brought this up to my attorney,
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.940]   I said, you know, how can I trust somebody
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.700]   if there's a valid power of attorney?
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.860]   She could clean me out.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.220]   And her response to me was,
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.980]   well, why would you trust somebody
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.740]   when you're, you know, half dead,
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.140]   you know, half brain dead in the hospital?
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.380]   It should be somebody that you could trust
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.980]   while you're, you know, compus mentis and non-compus mentis.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.460]   So I just throw that out there, too.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.100]   My question, though, is what advice do you give
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.980]   to your clients about the reality
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.380]   about returning to the workforce
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.620]   after being out for a period of time?
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.320]   - First of all, sorry for your loss.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:28.100]   I don't know, I don't really have a great answer to that.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.180]   So what advice would we give to somebody
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.460]   who's been out of the workforce?
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:39.120]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.780]   What is it, you know, (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:52.640]   - Yeah, so first of all, that would be very admirable,
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.760]   and it's unfortunate because you,
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.480]   it sounds like you did have to take time off
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.480]   because of your husband passing.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.560]   I mean, I would think the best thing I would do
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.920]   is just stay very active on the LinkedIn community,
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.600]   stay closely connected to wherever it is you were working,
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.220]   make sure your resume stays fresh.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:15.960]   I don't really have a great answer to that, though.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.800]   Anybody?
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:22.000]   - This is like not necessary for everybody.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.400]   This came up, we were looking at the stats
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.480]   around the impact of women staying home
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.920]   to take care of kids, especially in the first four years.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.840]   And there was a great report that was done on it
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.560]   that was like the biggest financial hit
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.200]   is not that they are not earning money.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.040]   And it is not that they are not saving.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.480]   It is that when they come back to the workforce,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.840]   their marketable skills have gone down,
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.920]   and people are like, oh, we're gonna pay you less
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.340]   in real terms than when you were here last.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.540]   So I think the key thing there is take whatever time you can
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.600]   to keep some evidence-based skill up
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.300]   that you're like, I have been doing this.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.080]   I have been volunteering to do taxes down here.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.920]   I have been doing some professional thing.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.840]   So that it is, and you know,
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.640]   if you haven't lifted weights for four years
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.320]   and you come back, the first time you do it is horrific.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.880]   Whereas if you just go every once in a while,
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.920]   it's not that bad.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:21.060]   So I think a little bit of continuing to do something
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.840]   to keep those muffles there and keep it evidence,
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.600]   like it can be one day a week, whatever.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.360]   It's just keep your foot in the game just a little bit.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.680]   And I would also flip it and say,
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.760]   this is a opportunity to think about changing careers
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.200]   if you haven't.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.360]   Again, not for everybody.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.940]   My wife went through this.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.660]   She went from being a public school teacher
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.120]   to being a software engineer.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.000]   She learned how to program, did all that stuff,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.640]   and ended up coming out of it much happier.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.060]   So it is, you know, you can go into the chrysalis
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.520]   and metamorphosis and come out the other side
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.360]   of something new.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.000]   - Thank you all.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.600]   I think we're gonna have to cut it off now.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.760]   Sorry.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.040]   Thank you to a tremendous panel.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.560]   It has been my honor to be with you, meet you all.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.120]   Rick, tell us where we're going now.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.960]   We're going back to the next room for your conversation
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.200]   with Burt Malkiel, is that right?
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.960]   Okay, thank you all.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.800]   - Thank you very much.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
