[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Most of you will recall that we are still dealing with verses 6, 7, and 8 in the twelfth
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.520]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.960]   Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.160]   (let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith) or ministry (let us wait to know
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.240]   our ministry) or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhortation, he that
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.760]   giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth with diligence, he that showeth
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.000]   mercy with cheerfulness.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.560]   Now having looked at the exact meaning of those particular words that the apostle there
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:53.480]   uses, we have moved on to consider this statement in general, because as we have seen, here
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.200]   we find the apostle not only giving instructions as to how the members of the church at Rome
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.040]   should conduct and comport themselves, and describing the kind of gifts that the Holy
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:15.960]   Spirit gives, dispenses, deals to the different members of the church, we have seen at the
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.400]   same time that it is therefore incidentally a description and an account and a picture
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.480]   of the life of the early church.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.680]   Now that's the thing that is engaging our attention at the moment.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.480]   It raised of course immediately the whole question of offices in the church, or orders,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.600]   if you like, of ministry in the church, and we have considered that.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.480]   But having done that, we have moved on to consider another aspect of this matter, because
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.320]   here I say you have a picture of the kind of way in which the early church lived and
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.600]   conducted her life.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.480]   And that I suggest is important for us, and especially at the present time.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.760]   There are many reasons why we should consider this.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.720]   If we had no other reason, this ought to be enough.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.120]   If we do indeed believe that this is the word of God, and that the church, not only in her
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.500]   doctrine, but also in her government and in her worship, is to be governed by the teaching
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.320]   of the Bible, well then it behoves us, when we read a statement like this, to examine
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.200]   ourselves to see whether we conform to that, or whether we do not.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.680]   The church should always be doing that.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.200]   The church, if you like, should always be under the word, and should be always reforming
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   herself according to the word.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.400]   And there is no doubt that many of the great troubles that have afflicted the life of the
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.120]   Christian church have been due to the fact that she has forgotten to do that.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.200]   The danger always is that we just go on thoughtlessly, continuing that which we've been accustomed
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   to, or that in which we have been brought up.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.840]   Now that, for Christian people, is always wrong.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.180]   What I mean is this.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.200]   If you can't prove and establish that your tradition is scriptural, well then it is wrong
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   to continue in it.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.520]   And in any case, we should always be ready to examine ourselves in the whole of our Christian
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.720]   lives according to this word.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.860]   But as I've been trying to show you, there are many reasons why this becomes particularly
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.720]   important for us at this present time.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.120]   There is this whole movement in the world today to reconsider the nature of the Christian
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   church.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.200]   It's done in terms of a great plea for the unity of the church.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.440]   Well, obviously, we must know the nature of the church before we can begin to discuss
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680]   the character of her unity.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.560]   So that compels us to do this.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.800]   Whether we like it or not, we are all involved in these movements.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.040]   We've all got to take some kind of decision.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.480]   Then there is the obvious tendency to turn more and more to liturgical, Catholic types
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.000]   of service.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.240]   And that is something which is happening to all the churches.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   For instance, here in Westminster, a week tonight, Good Friday evening, there is to
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.200]   be a procession of all the churches.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.920]   Well, I say all, this church won't be involved, but all the churches of Westminster are expected
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.280]   to have a procession from Trafalgar Square to the Roman Catholic Cathedral, not far away
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.640]   from here, where a service will be conducted by Cardinal Heenan and the Bishop of London
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.960]   and the Minister of the Westminster Central Hall.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.080]   Now that's the kind of thing you see that is happening.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.800]   And it is because of that I say it is our bounden duty as Christian people to have some
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.920]   understanding of these matters.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.560]   I came across a statement the other day.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.280]   There have been conversations going on for some time between the Church of England and
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.320]   the Presbyterian Church of England, and they have recently issued a report.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   And these are the things which they say.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:13.040]   No church as it now exists is adequately prepared and equipped in its theological formulations
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.440]   or in its forms of worship or in its methods of evangelism for the tasks to which the Holy
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.640]   Spirit is summoning it in the future.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.920]   You notice what they say.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.720]   No church as it now exists is adequately prepared and equipped in its theological formulations
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.960]   or in its forms of worship or in its methods of evangelism.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.840]   They say that all these things are going to be considered.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.160]   We are considering at the moment the forms of worship.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.680]   Here's another one.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.840]   The signs are too numerous that the denominations are aware of the judgment of history and of
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.520]   the need to find new patterns of church life, witness, and service.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.960]   So that as I say, whether you want to or not, you are involved in all this.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.000]   Here are these churches saying that they've got to re-examine everything.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.520]   But if they are saying that, how much more so should we say that?
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.880]   And especially as I said, when we know beforehand that though they talk about examining, what
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.920]   they really mean is that they've already made up their minds.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.880]   What it really means is that the free churches have got to re-examine themselves and adopt
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.560]   the Catholic type of church service.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.720]   There is no question about that at all.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.320]   There are statements made which say that this can be assumed as the government of the church
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:45.080]   is going to be episcopal, so the service will be beyond any question Catholic, liturgical,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.520]   in its type and in its form.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.040]   Well now that is why I say we must go out of our way to inform our minds and have a
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.920]   true understanding of these things.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:03.600]   Nothing is worse than merely to speak out of prejudice, merely to speak out of tradition.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.880]   It's unintelligent apart from anything else, and it's certainly not spiritual.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.440]   The way in which people so often argue for the thing they've been brought up in, simply
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.320]   because they've been brought up in it.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.440]   They often don't know why this was ever started, nor who started it.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.800]   But because it's mine, it must be right.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.920]   That is, I say, utterly unspiritual in its attitude.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.720]   The kind of thing our Lord was condemning in the woman of Samaria, as we saw in the
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.200]   reading just now.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.520]   We mustn't be governed by prejudices or merely out to defend what we've always done.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.480]   Now let's be quite clear about this.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.120]   We are not judging anybody else in doing this.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.920]   That's not my object at all.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.640]   I'm not concerned even to judge the Catholic type of worship, but I am concerned to examine
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.960]   it, and to examine it in the light of Scripture.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:05.000]   And we ourselves must be ready to admit and to confess that we are in danger also.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.920]   We all develop traditions, and it may be that we also will find that we are not as fully
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.480]   in conformity with the teaching of the Scripture as we sometimes imagine ourselves to be.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.000]   We've seen in our historical review of this matter last Friday night, how men and women
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.840]   with the best intentions in the world could and have departed from the Scriptural teaching.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.360]   And we are still in the flesh, and we are subject to the same things.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.160]   And there is the danger that we will become traditionalists, and say that things have
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.920]   got to be done always in the same way.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.080]   Now, this thing can sometimes be even ridiculous.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.680]   There's been talk in recent years about having our Sunday services at 11 and 6.30,
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.960]   and there are some people who really do give the impression that they think that that is
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.680]   the teaching of the Scripture, that they've got to be at 11 and 6.30.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.840]   Well, that's simply because they've never known anything else.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.560]   But that is ridiculous.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.000]   As we have to modify that during the war, because of blackout regulations and so on,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.280]   we must always be ready to modify or to change, if necessary, if it leads to greater efficiency
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.440]   in the work and the ministry of the Christian Church.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.200]   So let's try to rid ourselves of prejudices.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.640]   I'm not concerned to attack anybody else.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:36.680]   I'm concerned to examine myself, and to help all of you to examine yourselves, concerning
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:43.560]   these matters of worship and forms of worship in the light of the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:50.080]   We've seen that this is something really that came in in the fourth century.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.840]   I mean by that the liturgical type of service, with the service already written and had to
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:01.360]   be repeated as regards prayers and the conduct of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper and
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.240]   baptism and so on.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.640]   It came in in the fourth century and developed in the way we've seen, and we saw the varying
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.480]   attitudes of the Reformers.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   These men of God, these men who wanted to be scriptural, they could disagree.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.600]   That's why nobody must be over-dogmatic about these matters.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.240]   I was able to tell you things about John Calvin last Friday night, which must have surprised
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   some of you.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.960]   The English Puritans departed very considerably from the teaching of John Calvin.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.160]   And indeed, John Knox also modified his teaching in his Presbyterian system, and so on.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.520]   Very well, then, let us approach it all in a spirit of humility and with a desire to
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:48.680]   discover what is right, that in all things we may live to the glory of God.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.560]   Now having done that, I said there were certain general arguments, and we must now address
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.220]   ourselves to them.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.440]   We did look last Friday night at our Lord's own teaching.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:08.380]   We considered the question of the Lord's Prayer, and we suggested that there was not so much
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.440]   a command to repeat that as to regard it as the model prayer.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.120]   Teach us how to pray, probably mainly in private, but there it is.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:28.320]   And we also saw that the apostles had clearly left no specific teaching with regard to these
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.440]   liturgical services and stated prayers, fixed prayers.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.200]   They didn't give these prayers to people.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.680]   But now, let's go on from there.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.460]   Let's look at it like this.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.760]   What is the general impression you get as you read your New Testament?
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   This is always important.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:53.180]   There is a danger sometimes that we miss the word because of the trees, that we concentrate
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:58.600]   so much on particular texts that we forget the general tenor of the Scripture, the general
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.060]   atmosphere or spirit of the New Testament as a whole.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.100]   And this is the most important point.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.660]   Because we have no specific injunction from our Lord or the apostles to offer particular
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:19.140]   prayers or to conduct services in a particular way, this general atmosphere or spirit becomes
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.940]   correspondingly very much more important.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.060]   And I think there can be no doubt about this at all.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.740]   The kind of worship which you had in the New Testament is the kind of thing indicated in
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.220]   our three verses.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.820]   The apostle here, without sitting down to do so, as I've been showing you, incidentally
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:43.420]   describes the kind of thing that they did in the church at Rome.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:50.060]   And you've got, of course, your corresponding verses which we've already read in 1 Corinthians
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:57.100]   14, one of the psalms, another of the prophecy, and so on.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:05.260]   And again in Ephesians 5, where he tells us that they sang to one another in psalms and
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.940]   hymns and spiritual songs and so on.
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:16.140]   Now I argue that the impression therefore given is this, of a free and of a spontaneous
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.140]   worship.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:24.340]   Indeed, there is very little doubt but that in the church of Corinth, this element of
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:31.580]   freedom and of spontaneity was so evident that it led to a certain amount of disorder.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.980]   Now with your liturgical services you can't have disorder, but in the church of Corinth
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.540]   you had disorder in the services.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.580]   And the apostle has to tell them, let everything be done decently and in order.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.860]   But if you are tied in your service to a definite form, you can't have disorder.
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.900]   It's all controlled.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:56.980]   So I'm arguing that the New Testament teaching historically about the disorders that were
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:03.540]   arising in certain churches is in and of itself a proof that the worship of the New Testament
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.060]   church was a free one, was a spontaneous one.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.580]   Very well, but let's go on beyond that.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:22.700]   That I say, in turn, this is my second point, is something that one would expect because
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:31.460]   it is consistent with and conforms to the teaching in the Bible as to the difference
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.620]   between the New Testament and the Old Testament.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.180]   Now this is a subject about which we've got to be careful.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:46.820]   We need the two testaments, and yet there is a difference between the new and the old.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.300]   The new is the new dispensation.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.380]   The old is the old dispensation.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.740]   The same God, the same grace, the same salvation.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:02.700]   As we've been seeing at great length in working through chapters 9, 10, and 11, the
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.740]   Christian is after all a child of Abraham.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.340]   Abraham is our father, he's the father of all the children of faith.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:16.580]   So there is this identity between the two and the continuity between the two, and yet
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.540]   there is a difference.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:25.980]   Now this, to me, is an extremely important point, because there are two great possible
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.780]   errors at this point, and with regard to this matter, and many have fallen into the one
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.740]   or the other.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:39.620]   The one is to divorce the New Testament entirely from the old, and to say the old has got nothing
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.860]   to do with us, the new is entirely new.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.860]   That's wrong.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.300]   We could easily prove that from quotations in the New, and the way in which the new looks
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.380]   upon the old.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:55.940]   And it violates this whole principle that it is one grace of God, and one way of salvation,
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.380]   and one eternal covenant of salvation.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.340]   So that is wrong.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.580]   But then you see, there is the other danger of saying that there is no difference between
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:13.340]   the old and the new, and the corresponding fallacy that comes out of that of governing
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.100]   the new by the old.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.540]   And this is a very real danger to certain people.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.020]   And they are people who belong to the Reformed tradition in particular.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:30.580]   They know the value of the old, and their danger is to exaggerate, and to overestimate
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.380]   the value of the old.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.660]   And so they tend to control the new by the old.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.460]   Now I'm suggesting that that is wrong.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.140]   That there is a difference between the new and the old.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.460]   It is a difference in degree.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.460]   It is not in kind.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.460]   Let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:55.900]   There's a verse that has often perplexed people, about what our Lord says about John the Baptist.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:04.260]   Our Lord says about John the Baptist in Matthew 11, 11, "Verily I say unto you, among them
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:10.060]   that are born of women, there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist, notwithstanding
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.220]   he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.220]   What does that mean?
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.460]   Does it mean that John the Baptist is not to be regarded as a saved man and a child
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.460]   of God?
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.420]   Well that is patently and obviously wrong.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.420]   So what is the difference between John the Baptist and the least in the kingdom of heaven?
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:32.940]   I suggest that it is a difference not in relationship to God, not in his standing before God, but
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.340]   it is very much a difference in his understanding.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:44.580]   You see John the Baptist, because he belongs to the old, was in uncertainty and unhappiness.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.300]   The Christian is a man who should be rejoicing with a joy unspeakable and full of glory,
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.580]   and be filled with a great spirit of assurance.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.380]   If you take John the Baptist and contrast him with the apostles on and after the day
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.140]   of Pentecost you will see exactly what I mean.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:06.980]   Now that is this point that I am making as to the difference between the old and the
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.980]   new.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:14.180]   But we have got a prophecy also, the prophecy of John that was quoted by Peter in his sermon
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.820]   on the day of Pentecost which puts the thing still more clearly.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.820]   You remember what happened.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:24.420]   Here are these apostles and others baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.380]   And they became a phenomenon.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.660]   Some of the people in Jerusalem mocking said these men are full of new wine.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.340]   But Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them, you men of
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:41.220]   Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken unto my words.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.700]   For these are not drunken as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.780]   But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.100]   Well what did Joel say?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.100]   This is what he said.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:00.580]   It shall come to pass in the last days saith God that I will pour out of my spirit upon
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.660]   all flesh.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.900]   Not upon certain selected people only.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.540]   Not upon certain special people.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.900]   It's going to be a profusion upon all flesh.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.340]   And listen, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.340]   They didn't do that in the Old Testament.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.060]   Some people did prophesy.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.740]   But they were exceptional people.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.220]   But now with this great profusion your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.100]   young men shall see visions.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.660]   The people who saw visions unto the old were very few and rare.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.100]   The seers and the prophets.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.260]   Your old men shall dream dreams.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:40.340]   And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.060]   and they shall prophesy.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.820]   And I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath, etc.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:53.260]   Now there surely is this essential difference between the new and the old.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.220]   And it is something of course that we ignore at our peril.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.300]   It leads to a different type of worship.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.460]   Look at your Old Testament worship.
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.740]   The temple, the tabernacle were more or less essential.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.740]   Why?
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.660]   Well it was an external type of worship.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.900]   It was very formal.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:19.340]   Details were given as to the furnishings down to the smallest detail.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.980]   Everything was ordered.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.140]   Everything was prescribed exactly.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.620]   And God having given the detailed instructions to Moses said to him, "See that they'll
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:34.340]   make all things, do all things according to the pattern shown unto thee in the mount."
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.780]   It was external.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.780]   It was formal.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.100]   It was ceremonial.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:46.100]   It had a priesthood, definitely appointed and set apart, and so on.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.860]   But now the New Testament is entirely different.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.540]   It is an inner, internal type of worship.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.540]   It is free.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   It's not formal.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.900]   Our Lord would sit down in a boat and start preaching, sit down on the side of a mountain.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.340]   He'd do it in a house, anywhere.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.460]   You're out of the realm of the formal and the external.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:14.580]   It is a living, vital, internal, spiritual type of worship.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.780]   And no longer are we to recognize only certain people as priests.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:25.620]   My friends, we need to remember the Protestant Reformation, the universal priesthood of all
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.620]   believers.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.280]   That's why we don't walk in these processions.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.360]   We don't want to go back to a priesthood.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.340]   We believe, we assert the universal priesthood of all believers.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:42.060]   We are all made, we are a kingdom of priests as Christians.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.780]   We are a royal priesthood.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:50.020]   Now you see, that is what I mean by saying that there is this essential difference between
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.700]   the new and the old.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.780]   So when you read about the kind of church life that you see in the New Testament in
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:02.140]   verses such as we are looking at, I say you're impressed at once.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.060]   Ah, this is the very thing that I would expect from the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:12.040]   This is what I'd expect as the result of the shedding forth in this great profusion
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.260]   of the blessed Holy Spirit of God.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:20.700]   Very well, let's go on.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.780]   You remember that I, this is my third point, you remember that I indicated last Friday
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:32.980]   night in my historical review that one of the arguments for the sect forms of worship
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:42.300]   was that they were essential because of the ignorance and the inability of most of the
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:48.020]   priests who have become Protestant ministers.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.260]   And I admitted that it was an argument that had a certain amount of currency, and I still
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.260]   do so.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.660]   And yet I want to suggest to you that it's an argument that you've got to handle very,
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.260]   very carefully from this standpoint.
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:09.460]   Is not our Lord and Savior capable of giving ability to men?
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:15.820]   Is it not possible for the Lord to raise up men and give them gifts which will enable
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.180]   them to conduct worship, to pray, and to preach, and so on?
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:26.580]   Well, of course, the answer to my rhetorical question is the three verses that we are examining.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:33.060]   God does, our Lord does give these gifts through the Spirit, and he can give them to anybody.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.260]   That is one of the glorious things that we find in the New Testament, having them gifts
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.180]   differing according to the grace that is given to us.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.100]   And there is no limit.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.180]   He can do it, you see, to the servants and the handmaidens, the young men as well as
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.180]   the old.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.500]   It is not restricted.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.340]   And this is, as I say, something that you find not only in the New Testament, but you've
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:59.860]   had fulfilled so many times during the subsequent history of the Christian Church.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.300]   God can give a man a gift, and he can raise up a man.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.260]   Obviously that must have happened in many of the early churches.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.060]   Try and put your minds back to the conditions.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.140]   Here are the apostles and others.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.980]   They were travelers, they went round, they preached the gospel, people were converted,
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.860]   they formed them into churches, then on they went.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.860]   What happened to the churches?
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   Well, there is an obvious answer to that.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.420]   In a sense, we've already considered it.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:30.480]   The Spirit gave gifts to different men, and they stood out according to their gifts.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.340]   And so they were elected as elders, and some of them became teaching elders.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.500]   They have the gift of teaching out of the churches themselves.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:47.740]   Well now, in the last years, the church has been realizing this truth more and more.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:53.180]   Take those books written by that excellent man, Roland Allen, on St. Paul's missionary
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.380]   methods and ours.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.380]   I think they're now generally accepted.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:02.380]   And what Roland Allen pointed out as far back as 1913 was just this, that the Western churches
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.220]   had been adopting a wrong method in their missionary work.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.100]   You see, they would go and people would be converted, and then they would stay as the
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.100]   ministers.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.140]   And Roland Allen points out that the apostles didn't do that.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.820]   The ministers arose out of the people.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.820]   How?
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.900]   Well, they didn't raise themselves.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.220]   The Spirit gave the gift.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:28.580]   And so, out of the churches themselves, you develop the ministry, the type of ministry
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.580]   that is essential.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.660]   And I say, to say that that cannot happen, and that therefore you must get one or two
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:41.300]   men to write out prayers for everybody else to read, is surely a reflection on the power
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   of our Lord to give gifts to men and to provide the necessary gifts for his servants and ministers
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.140]   in the life of the church.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.780]   I feel it is wrong scripturally, therefore, to argue like that, and also historically.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:03.580]   I'm prepared to grant it as a very temporary expedient, but it mustn't be continued.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:10.140]   Let me just illustrate that I came across a very good illustration, I feel, in the case
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.580]   of John Owen over this very matter.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.660]   He used this illustration.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:26.540]   He said, you know, that to ask men to go on reading these forms and prayers perpetually
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.420]   is something like this, he said.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.100]   He uses the illustration of men being taught to swim.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.500]   And at first, the men can't swim, so what you do is you provide them with what we now
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   call wings.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   They used to do it then with two bladders that were blown up and tied together, and
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.940]   you put the men into the water, and of course the two bladders, they float him, and they
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.860]   keep him on the surface of the water, and so he can learn how to swim.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.860]   But as John Owen points out, you don't go on using the bladders as long as you live.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.660]   You'll never learn to swim if you do.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.940]   It's all right.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.220]   You don't throw a man straight in and tell him to get out.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.700]   You help him by these floaters or bladders or whatever you may happen to use.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.380]   But then you tell him, now stop that.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.380]   Get rid of those.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.180]   Start all right, but don't go on.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.260]   And then I read about another illustration, same kind of thing.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.820]   If a man breaks his leg or something, well, for a while he'll have to use a crutch.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.580]   And he's right that he should use a crutch just for a while, but he mustn't go on using
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.580]   the crutch the rest of his life.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.260]   It's a temporary experience and a justifiable as temporary experience.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:39.940]   But to use them permanently is surely a reflection upon the power of our Lord, I say, to give
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.540]   gifts in this way.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.140]   Or let me put it like this to you, as my fourth point.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:53.940]   That surely that is ultimately the wrong way of facing this problem of the absence of gifts.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.340]   Now, you may say, well, what's all this got to do with us in this ancient history?
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.380]   It isn't.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.540]   I know churches now in different parts of this country where they can no longer have
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.220]   prayer meetings or any other weeknight meetings.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.220]   Why not?
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.900]   Well, they say there's nobody here who can pray now.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.180]   I've known those churches with big flourishing prayer meetings.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.540]   They can't hold one at all now.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.460]   And they say, we have nobody who can pray, nobody who can give an address, nobody who
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.540]   can guide us, nobody who can conduct a Bible class.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.740]   Nobody seems to have the ability.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.100]   So it is a very modern problem, you see.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.500]   How do you face this problem?
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:33.780]   Well, I say the way to face it is not to provide a book out of which anybody can read.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:39.300]   The way to face a problem like that is this, that you get the church to examine itself
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.340]   and say, why can nobody pray here in public?
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   What's the matter?
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.140]   Is the modern Christian different from the old Christian?
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.900]   Why don't men pray today like men used to pray?
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.100]   You face it like that and you say to them, get down on your knees and ask God to forgive
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.660]   you, and without knowing it they've started praying.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.700]   Merely to ask forgiveness in public is a prayer.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.820]   So the way to face this problem is not to provide a kind of crutch that is to be permanently
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:11.900]   used, it is to repent and to ask God to have mercy and to shower down his blessing upon
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   us.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.140]   Now, I think that here again we've got a principle that has a wider application.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:24.060]   I see a tendency in the church today to repeat this fallacy in different realms, not knowing
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.740]   how other forms of prayer.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.500]   Look at it like this.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.540]   There's a great difference today, between today and what used to be the case in the
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:42.620]   past, in the way in which a church or churches face a period of dryness and a period of more
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.980]   or less ineffectiveness.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.220]   Nowadays when the church is in such a state, what is done is this, it is decided to call
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.700]   in some evangelistic organization to do something, to put things right.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.140]   But you know, it used not to be done like that.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.900]   There was a time in the Christian church when if there wasn't much blessing and very few
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.580]   people being converted, they would face it like this.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.020]   They'd say, "What's the matter with us?
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.220]   Why are people not being converted?
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.220]   What's wrong?"
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.060]   They say, "Why has the Spirit of God left us?"
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:20.860]   They say, "Let us appoint a day of prayer and humiliation and fasting.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.540]   Let us go before the Lord and confess to him that we are failing him.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.740]   Let us ask him to show us where we've gone wrong and to come back amongst us."
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.820]   And they'd go on doing that until revival came.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.560]   Surely that's the scriptural method.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:41.140]   Not to call in some expedient from the outside, let me give you a still more practical illustration
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.140]   of what I mean.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.740]   Let me put it in personal terms.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.780]   Forgive me for the personal reference.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.980]   I've got a very great problem and I want to pass my problem on to you.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:58.740]   And I'd be glad if you'd think about this and somehow or another give me your answers.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:05.060]   As I speak here, what I'm saying is being recorded on a tape recorder.
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.940]   And that happens Friday night and twice on Sunday.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.100]   We get letters here asking us for these tapes.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.260]   Different parts of the country.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.260]   Here's my problem.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.260]   Should I let them have the tapes or not?
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.340]   There are people who do let them have the tapes.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.780]   On the whole, I don't.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.860]   Why not?
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.460]   The argument that I'm given is this.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.980]   They say, "But think of these people in different parts of the country.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.260]   Nobody to preach to them on Sundays.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.740]   Or perhaps men preaching against the truth instead of preaching the truth.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.420]   Isn't it your duty to send out the tapes?"
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.660]   Well, now that's one argument, but I've got to reply to that.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.020]   And it's this same principle that I'm putting before you now.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.940]   What I'm afraid of, you see, is this.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.420]   That we'll eventually reach a stage in which there'll be perhaps just about half a dozen
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:54.300]   preachers in this country and everybody else will be listening to the tapes of these preachers.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.300]   It's not impossible.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.980]   There is a tendency in that direction.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.700]   And it's obviously increasing.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.780]   I say that's wrong.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:07.620]   Cannot God the Holy Spirit give gifts to men in these churches?
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.740]   There is this danger of providing it ready-made.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:15.500]   Now that's the argument, you see, behind these liturgical forms of service.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.480]   It's already there and all you do is read it.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.660]   One man prepares it, hundreds or thousands perhaps read it.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.180]   It's exactly the same principle.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:32.780]   And it does seem to me to be a principle that tends to violate this teaching which is so
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:40.540]   plain in the Scripture that the same Lord who could raise up men amongst the slaves
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:46.540]   and the servants of the first century to do these things in the church can surely still
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.540]   do so.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:53.340]   But you see, we seem to have forgotten the Holy Spirit and we say send us tapes or provide
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.540]   us with sermons or provide us with prayers.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:03.380]   Why? it is somewhat of a reflection upon the power of the Spirit to provide the necessary
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.100]   men and the necessary gifts.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.980]   Think about that, work it out.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.460]   But let me go to my fifth argument.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:19.020]   Is there not something about these prescribed forms of worship which seems to contradict
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.380]   certain very plain statements in the New Testament?
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.700]   I read one of them to you at the beginning out of that interview between our Lord and
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.700]   the woman of Samaria.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:34.660]   Listen, you, the woman says to him, and this is typical of the argument you see, "Our
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.300]   fathers worshipped in this mountain."
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.380]   You say that in Jerusalem is the place where men are to worship.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.660]   I say that's the old, that's the old.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:50.220]   This is our Lord's answer, "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when you shall neither
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:55.700]   in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship the Father."
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.300]   You mustn't have these set places of necessity.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.540]   You may or you may not.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.500]   You mustn't confine it to that.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.340]   You worship you know not what.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.940]   We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:16.700]   But the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.220]   and in truth.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:25.180]   Not the old, either in this mountain or Jerusalem, in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.380]   such to worship him.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:33.740]   God is spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.820]   And read when you go home the seventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles and
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:43.260]   you'll see that the martyr Stephen had to develop precisely the same argument with those
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:49.100]   stiff-necked Jews that would confine it to the Old Testament form.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.100]   No, no.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.540]   And then take another one.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.020]   We've already come across it in our study of this epistle to the Romans.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.500]   Take Romans 8, 26, 27.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:08.780]   "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.500]   we ought."
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.300]   You can't say that if you rely upon written prayers, can you?
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.580]   We know not what we should pray for as we ought.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.980]   Well, what is the provision for us?
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.180]   Oh, prayers prepared by certain great men.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.180]   No, no.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:30.700]   "The Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.500]   And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, for he maketh intercession
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.860]   for the saints according to the will of God."
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:45.600]   The answer to our inability is not prepared prayers, it is the Spirit.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.900]   It may be a groan, something inarticulate almost, but it's a prayer with groanings
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.780]   which cannot be uttered.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780]   And you remember the exhortations.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:57.540]   There are several of them in the New Testament about prayer.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:03.780]   I think of the one, for instance, in the last chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, verse
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.780]   18.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:11.860]   "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit."
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.860]   In the Spirit.
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.080]   That's how you pray.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.620]   You don't pray through forms, you pray in the Spirit.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.420]   The Spirit will give you the prayer and he will give you the facility and the power and
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.180]   all that you need.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.880]   So I feel that we've got to consider those three texts without deducing any further ones
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.900]   very seriously before we come to a final decision about this matter.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.740]   But then, my sixth argument is that isn't there here a very grave danger of interfering
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:48.700]   with the freedom of the Spirit and a sudden, immediate inspiration?
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.820]   Now I could illustrate this point, you see, from preaching.
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:58.140]   It's a great problem which every preacher present must have met at some time or another.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.380]   We're not all equally gifted in the matter of speech.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.580]   And there are some men who almost seem to be incapable of preaching unless they write
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.580]   out every word.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:13.060]   The great Dr. Thomas Chalmers really couldn't preach without his manuscript.
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.340]   But this is a very important point, it seems to me.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.420]   I'm not going to go so far as to say that a man should never write a sermon, I don't
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   believe that.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:25.900]   But I do say this, that the preacher must always be free.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:32.540]   Oh, how many times have I personally found this, that what has been used of God is something
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.780]   that I'd never thought of until the moment I uttered it.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:41.460]   It was given me at the moment, not in my preparation, the freedom of the Spirit.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.740]   It happens in prayer, it happens in preaching.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:49.580]   And we must be very careful lest we put limits upon this freedom of the Spirit.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.980]   If you're tied to a particular text, where does the Spirit come in?
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.180]   These are the things that we've been tending to forget.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:02.900]   I remember once asking some twenty years ago by now the then religious director of the
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.740]   BBC, we were having a discussion about these matters and I was trying to explain to him
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.700]   why I didn't preach on their programs.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.380]   I put it in the form of a question.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.580]   I said, "What would happen to your program if the Holy Spirit suddenly came upon the
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.580]   preacher?
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.260]   What would happen to your programs?"
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.940]   And he admitted it was a fair question.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.700]   Very well.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.180]   But look at it like this, my dear friend.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:37.100]   Is there not a danger of our doing something which is antagonistic to revival?
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.500]   There is this essential element of freedom in revival.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.860]   There must be an opportunity for the Spirit to break in.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:50.980]   Let's be careful that in our desire to have dignified services, that's the word, dignified
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.980]   services.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.260]   It's been the tragedy of nonconformity.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.460]   We began to talk about dignity and learning in the middle of the last century and it's
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.580]   gone down ever since.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.540]   Dignified services.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.900]   The test of a service is not whether it's dignified or not, it's the power of the Spirit
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.900]   in it.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:14.260]   And we must be very careful lest we hinder the coming of revival.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.780]   Why hasn't there been a revival for so long?
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.820]   Isn't this partly the answer?
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.460]   The Spirit is not being given an opportunity.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.340]   In other words, there is a danger of quenching the Spirit.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.900]   Dr. John Owen, for me to quote him again, says quite specifically that in the light
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:38.300]   of verses 6, 7, and 8 of Romans 12, liturgical services and red prayers are definitely guilty
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.860]   of quenching the Spirit.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.780]   I personally think he's going a little bit too far.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:50.260]   But that there is the danger is absolutely right, because you see, the Holy Spirit is
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.460]   so powerful that he can even break in through a red service.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.260]   He's done so many times.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.260]   One of the greatest preachers 200 years ago in the Methodist awakening in Wales was a
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:07.060]   man called Daniel Rowland, and the Spirit really came upon him as he was reading the
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.740]   communion service out of the Book of Common Prayer.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.660]   Now you see there are people who say, "Ah, well, very well, doesn't that justify it?"
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.660]   It doesn't.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.180]   That's the exception, and the exception doesn't prove the rule.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:24.500]   The Holy Spirit can come in in spite of our quenching him, and in spite of our forms which
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.380]   put limits upon him.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:31.140]   But that doesn't justify our continuing in that procedure.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:36.060]   There is the danger, then, I say, of limiting the freedom of the Spirit.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.340]   Let me put it like this, as I've often put it.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:44.380]   How often have you heard of a revival breaking out in a cathedral service?
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.300]   That's the test.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:52.900]   And lastly, is not this a simple fact?
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:41:00.980]   That a condition of low spirituality in the Christian church always leads to the use of
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.220]   forms.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.500]   When men cannot preach, they begin to read their sermons.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.060]   When they can't pray, they begin to read their prayers.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:20.860]   Low spirituality in the church always leads in the direction of the Catholic type of service,
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.140]   with an emphasis upon beauty and what they call "worship."
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.340]   They mean by that, set forms.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.340]   Invariably.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.220]   That's what's happening in this present century.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:37.860]   On the contrary, whenever there is a revival, there is always a revival of extemporary
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.700]   praying and the freedom in the act of worship.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.660]   Now, evangelical men in all the denominations have always proved this.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:53.100]   You get evangelicals who normally use these set forms, and you'll find that in evangelistic
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.460]   campaigns and other places, they always pray freely and extemporary.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:01.020]   Well, why shouldn't they do the same in all church services?
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.220]   You see, there's a contradiction involved there.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.580]   The more evangelical a man is, the more he desires freedom, and the more he will introduce
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:13.780]   extemporary prayers into his official service, even though it may mean that he's breaking
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.140]   the law in doing so.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:21.380]   It is always the tendency, and it's inevitable in an evangelical man with the spirit in him,
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:27.500]   to be free and to express himself freely with the whole of his spirit.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.780]   Well, my friends, our time has gone, and I think we must leave it at that.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:38.020]   Shall I just leave you then with a question, which seems to me to be the extension of this
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:42.260]   argument that I've been working out with you?
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.220]   Doesn't the whole question of hymn singing come in here as well?
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:51.980]   There are people who say you shouldn't sing hymns, that we should only sing psalms.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.500]   Doesn't all this argument apply to that?
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:01.860]   Are the psalms adequate to express the fullness of the New Testament experience?
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:08.580]   Can men who only saw these things afar off give the full expression of what is felt and
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:14.860]   experienced and thought by those who have it in the fullness of the Spirit?
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:21.580]   I suggest we need to examine this again very carefully and very seriously, lest we limit
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.140]   the new by the old.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:30.680]   You can become legalistic and literalists, and that is always wrong.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.420]   So I think that it applies to this also.
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:40.020]   And so again you will find that in all great times of movements of the Spirit, tides of
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:45.900]   the Spirit, that there is always a great outbreak of the composition of evangelical hymns and
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.420]   tunes and the singing of them.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:56.660]   Singing has always been one of the great characteristics of a true movement of the Spirit of God.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:04.940]   There was once, in the very, very early days of the separatists in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.340]   some of them went so far that they didn't sing at all.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.860]   They said that even singing hymns was wrong.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:15.660]   So they sang nothing, neither hymns nor psalms, no singing at all.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.340]   But they soon were corrected on that.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:23.900]   The Old Testament teaches you to sing, and to sing psalms.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:30.620]   But over and above that, obviously, they knew they began to sing spiritual songs and hymns,
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.100]   which clearly were given by the inspiration of the Spirit.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:41.420]   And this, I say, has therefore been a characteristic of the Church in all great periods of revival,
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:48.540]   quickening new life, coming into the people through the gracious operations of the Holy
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.540]   Spirit.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:56.020]   So, my friends and people, let us openly again, praying the Spirit to enlighten us and to
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:03.700]   lead us and to guide us, examine all we are and all we do, our forms of worship as well
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:09.700]   as our faith and Church government and all things, in the light of the teaching of the
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.700]   Scriptures.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:17.300]   Well, may God bless us to that end and bless us individually and collectively until, God
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:23.380]   willing, we meet together again three weeks tonight on April 22.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:34.180]   O Lord, our God, we again offer up our praise and our thanksgiving unto thee.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:40.780]   We thank thee for this liberty wherewith Christ has set us free in all its manifestations.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.460]   O Lord, have mercy and pity upon us.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:53.620]   We see how oftentimes in the spirit of fear we put our limits upon this glorious liberty.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:58.900]   O God, keep us from the dangers of excesses.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:05.300]   Keep us, we pray thee, equally from the dangers of legalism and of false literalism.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:11.020]   Lord, we thank thee for the ministry of the Spirit and not of the letter.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:17.460]   For the Spirit ever giveth life, but the letter ever tendeth to bondage and to death.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.860]   O God, keep us free.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:27.100]   But O, we ask at the same time that the Spirit who gives us the freedom may at the same time
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.180]   discipline us and order us.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.180]   We remember thy word.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:40.020]   God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.020]   and discipline.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:51.500]   O, may we manifest in all we do and say and are this blessed power of thy Holy Spirit
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:58.100]   upon us, that thy name may be magnified and glorified even through us.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:03.940]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:09.900]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:17.940]   of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.700]   Amen.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
