[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Are a lot of these deals online, or do you sometimes have to go into the physical store
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.960]   to get a gift card?
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.000]   There are definitely in-store only deals.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   We talked about Kroger and Safeway.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.040]   Those are examples where the good stuff is going to be in store.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.520]   From my perspective, as a middleman who's trying to make money on reselling gift cards,
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.600]   my favorite deals are like hyper-regional local grocery stores.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.440]   We track deals even from individual stores.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.160]   There's like five stores in Utah that we track that occasionally have great deals.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.400]   So oftentimes it's these obscure local grocery chains will sometimes have killer gift card
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.280]   deals, and you have to go in-person, in-store to get those deals.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.440]   That being said, there's plenty of online stuff, as we already talked about, the apps
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.280]   and giftcards.com and things like that.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.680]   There's deals in both places.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.140]   But if you think about Economics 101 and Supply and Demand, if there's a deal that's only
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.320]   available at five stores in Utah and you live next to one of those stores, then the market,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.600]   if you plan to resell those gift cards, will be much more favorable because you'll be the
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.920]   only supplier of them.
