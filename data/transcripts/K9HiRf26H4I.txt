[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.040]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. We get tons of questions every week on Twitter, email,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.760]   YouTube. People stop dunking on the street sometimes. And we like to try to answer them
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.240]   so askthecompoundshow@gmail.com is our email. Sponsor for today's show is Future Proof Festival
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:42.040]   2023. This was the Future Proof Festival this past year in 2022 is easily one of the most
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.900]   fun things I've ever done career-wise in finance. It's on the beach. We're gonna be doing live
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.860]   podcasts there. Duncan and I are gonna do a live Portfolio Rescue there. It was helpful
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.840]   from Josh and Michael, Animal Spirits live, Compound and Friends live, tons of well-known
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.080]   speakers. We're gonna do some musical acts. It's gonna be so much fun. Visit futureproof.advisorscircle.com
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.920]   for more. Duncan, one of my favorite things about the one last year, the food, was food
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.940]   trucks. And you could just go eat it whenever you wanted. You didn't have to wait in like
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.760]   a buffet line or someone to bring you food at like most conferences.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.600]   - Right. And it was all-inclusive. You didn't have to have like tickets or, you know, pay
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.800]   separately, that kind of thing. That was nice. I like that.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.040]   - It's fun. We had a ton of people who aren't even in the finance world come last year who
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   were just kind of part of our audience and fans of the shows.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.240]   - Right. We met up with some of the Animal Spirits Discord people. Well, maybe we can
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.400]   do that again. That was fun. John and I went and met them. That was fun.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.480]   - That's right. Yeah. So anyway, check it out, Future Proof. I think if you go early,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.760]   you can get a little bit of a discount. Let's get rid of the questions.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.120]   - Up first today, we have a nice short one. Easy read from Edward. Is it crazy to be 100%
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.480]   in stocks from age 32 to sometime in my 50s for my retirement accounts?
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.560]   - I don't think it's crazy at all. But the thing is, there's no hard and fast rules for
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.960]   this that work for every person in every situation. But it certainly makes sense for younger investors
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.120]   to have more risk in their retirement accounts than older investors. My favorite finance
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.480]   writer of all time, William Bernstein. The guy's smart. He can communicate really good
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.400]   stuff. So he has a book called Deep Risk that goes over the concept of risk when it comes
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.160]   to investing better than any explanation I've ever read. Quick summary. He says risk comes
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.000]   in two flavors. Shallow risk, which is a loss of real capital, but it's recovered in a relatively
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.960]   short period of time, say within a few years. Deep risk is a permanent loss of capital.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.280]   That could be through something like inflation. That could be selling out at the wrong point.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.880]   That could be government confiscation, some of these things. And his whole thing is, stocks
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.960]   against deep risk, like a real loss of capital, but exacerbate shallow risk, which means you're
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.440]   gonna have a lot of volatility. So Bernstein's whole point is that if you're managing for
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.400]   short-term spending needs, you have to follow shallow risk, while long-term spending needs,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.160]   you have to be guided by deep risk. So the moral of the story is, if you're a young saver,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.280]   your biggest asset is human capital, right? It's your future earnings power and your savings.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.160]   You want to have lower prices. So the biggest risk of the stock market is prices go down,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.800]   right? As a young investor, you should be getting on your hands and knees and praying
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.720]   for lower prices, so you can put that savings to work at higher dividend yields and lower
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.700]   valuations and all that stuff. If you're an older investor, you still want to have a little
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.120]   bit of money in stocks, as we talked about before, but you have short-term spending needs,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.880]   and you might not be able to wait out a bear market as long. So I totally agree with this
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.560]   rule of thumb, but let's throw up the second question, because it's kind of a similar one,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.680]   and then before I get in, we can answer these both at the same time. So do another one.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.640]   Okay, up next, we have the following. "I don't get why people work a 30-plus year career
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.280]   while investing in stocks, only to glide path into a heavier bond allocation around retirement.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.200]   Why not just stay 100% in stocks and benefit from price appreciation and dividends for
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   life?"
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.840]   So I got both of these questions from the same blog post. So John, do a chart on here.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.040]   This is, I did a little thing of the calendar year returns from 1928 to 1922 for the S&P
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   500, broken out by different return. So you can see, 0 to 10%, 10 to 20. This is 95 years
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.840]   of historical data. One of the craziest things about the performance of the U.S. stock market
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.800]   historically is that you've been more likely to have a return in a given year of 20% or
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   more than a loss in your given year. Let me repeat that. Over the last 95 years, you've
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.320]   been more likely to have a gain of 20% or more than a loss, which is pretty crazy. So
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.960]   there have been 34 years with gains in excess of 20% over the last 95 years. That's more
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   than a third of the time. 26 down years in that time, which is around 25% of the time.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.640]   So not too bad. Now, people look at this stat, and I think that's why we got the questions
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.840]   and say, "Why would I not just have all of my money in stocks then?" Stocks are your
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.920]   best bet at earning a return over the rate of inflation. If you just wait for the long
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.240]   term, the dividends grow, all these things. I think the optimal portfolio for anyone with
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.440]   a time horizon that's multiple decades should be mostly equities, but sometimes your emotions
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.000]   hijack you and don't allow you to get to those long-term decade periods. So, John, do a chart
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.560]   onto the next one. That's just the drawdown. Even when we have gains, we've shown this
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.520]   before, the blue lines are the gains, the red dots are the entry-year peak-to-drop losses.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.600]   Since 1928, the average loss is like 16% a year, a little more than 16% a year. Since
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.640]   1950, it's a little more than 14% per year. So even with long-term returns that are great,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.700]   it can still be a volatile time in the short term, right? So I think some investors still
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.840]   need that emotional hedge, even when you're younger. I think that's kind of knowing yourself
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.080]   personally. I'm 41. For me personally, retirement accounts are all 100% stocks or equity-like
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.240]   investments. I have a time horizon that's measured in decades as opposed to years or
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.960]   months, so I'm fine taking that. But I still have liquid cash reserves or short-term bonds
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.160]   to see me through shorter-term goals and emergencies, and I imagine as I get closer to retirement
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.760]   that that would need to be picked up so that there'll be a higher balance in those liquid
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.820]   savings. So the thing is, you don't want to have to sell out of your stocks while they're
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.760]   down. So John, do the next one. This is S&P 500 bear markets since World War II, and I
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.360]   did peak-to-trough, means the top of the market when it peaks all the way to the bottom of
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.840]   the bear market, and how many months? That's an average of roughly 12 months, right? So
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.960]   call it a year on average, historically, for the last few bear markets. Then I did a break-even
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.240]   column showing, okay, how long did it take you to go from peak-to-trough back to break-even
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.680]   at all-time highs again? So that's, on average, 21 months, taking from the bottom. Add those
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.520]   up and you go peak-to-peak, and we're talking 33 months, so it's almost three years on average
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.880]   in the bear markets in modern history, where you go peak-to-trough back to peak. Shortest
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.000]   one was COVID crash at seven months. Longest one was the 1973-74 bear market, which took
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.760]   almost six years. So my whole point is, you can have these bear markets that last a long
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   time. The 2000-2002 bear market was also pretty long. You know, you don't want to be selling
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.680]   off your stocks when they're down for that long. Now, maybe you say, well, my portfolio's
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.520]   big enough, I can live off the dividends. That's fine. Dividends aren't written in stone
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.200]   either. In 2008 crisis, the dividends on the S&P 500 fell more than 31%. So they didn't
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.080]   fall nearly as much as prices, which were 56%, but they did fall. So it's true that
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.840]   most of your compounding gains come later in life, when you have a big portfolio. I
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.760]   think that's, if you did this straight-line spreadsheet and say, I'm gonna earn 7% per
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.720]   year every year, or 8%, whatever it is, the majority of the gains come when you have more
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.500]   money. Which, compounding, that makes sense, right? An 8% gain on a million dollars is
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.520]   way bigger than an 8% gain on $100,000. But I think you have to kind of balance out your
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.800]   ability to sit through a bear market and maybe have bad timing, versus, I still want to grow
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   my wealth. So I do think it's important to still grow your wealth when you're retired,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.640]   but I think you have to have some balance in there of having some short-term liquidity.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.480]   And the other thing is, I think people probably mentally bucket out different things where
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.240]   they're looking at short-term cash, or their real estate holdings, or their portfolio.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.720]   And so, most people don't have all of their net worth 100% invested in stocks anyway.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.000]   But I think if you're looking at a retirement portfolio, yeah, for young people, 100% is
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.240]   not crazy at all. When you get to retirement, I'm sure some people probably have the ability
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.860]   and intestinal fortitude to do that, but you're just setting yourself up for the potential
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.480]   for a really bad outcome if you're unlucky.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.440]   I have a question. Is there a term in the markets for the opposite of alpha? Because
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.520]   looking at those benchmarks in history, it's pretty amazing, looking at my trading account
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.280]   over the last year or so. What do you call that, when it's the opposite of outperformance?
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.640]   That's called reality, I think. The market is really hard to beat, unfortunately. And
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.800]   even the people who do this for a living, they do this all the time. They have the computers
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.240]   and they have the quants, and they hire these people from MIT to be rocket scientists who
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.160]   are going to figure out how to beat the market. Beating the market is hard.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.920]   Yeah, we can't all be Jim Simons, right?
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   Yes.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.480]   Also, on the dividend thing, am I crazy or did Disney used to have a dividend? I saw
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.640]   recently in my account that there's no dividend there. I just hadn't paid attention in a long
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   time.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.600]   I do believe that Disney canceled their dividend during COVID to kind of make up for the lost
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.780]   park revenues. And you get your Star Wars shows now because Disney canceled the dividend.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.520]   That lack of dividend, that's how they funded.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.660]   Maybe Bob Iger coming back will put that in there.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.660]   Okay.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:17.000]   Again, if you're somebody in their 30s and you can handle stocks moving around all the
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.040]   time and not touch it and not mess with it, then being 100% in stocks is certainly fine.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   I think there probably are retirees who can handle that kind of portfolio, but I would
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.160]   think that the number of them who can handle the emotional volatility from it is very small.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.140]   And according to our poll in the chat right now, 72% of the chat say that they're nearly
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.480]   100% in equities in their portfolios.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.820]   That makes sense. We've got some long-term investors here. Good for them. All right,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.820]   let's do another one.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.940]   All right. Up next, we have a question from Zach, and this is a nice not to brag. I kind
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:58.220]   of like this one. Zach writes, "I'm a 38-year-old in California with $1.3 million in a 60/40
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:05.560]   portfolio with a 4% withdrawal from an inheritance, $250,000 personal portfolio of stocks, $150,000
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.820]   cash and some other small investments, and a paid-off house valued at $500,000. I have
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.620]   about 50% savings rate between my 4% withdrawal and income. I'm frugal, but here's the kicker.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.740]   I've been working low-paying jobs my whole life while in this position. I make about
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.780]   $20 an hour with no college degree. Sometimes I feel like I should just quit my job because
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.180]   this income isn't doing much in the grand scheme of things. I'm just saving money to
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.880]   save more money and not leveling up. How should I structure my portfolio in this situation?
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.020]   Should I quit my job and enjoy an average life with the assets I have?"
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.460]   I really like this question. This is why there are no hard and fast rules, because in the
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.460]   last question, I said most young people, human capital is their biggest asset, and for old
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:51.780]   people, it's financial assets. Zach is a relatively young person who has a ton of financial assets,
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:58.660]   and they dwarf his human capital. This is why there are exceptions to the rule. This
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:04.140]   is interesting. I want to run some quick numbers here. Zach said he's taking 4% on his $1.3
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:10.100]   million inheritance. That's around $52,000 a year. I don't know why the 4% from that
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.980]   portfolio. Maybe it's some sort of trust thing where he has to take that money, and that's
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.940]   how it's squashed out. That's why I was going to ask if that was a required thing. I'm guessing
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.280]   that that would make sense. Otherwise, if he's saving 50% of it, what's the point of
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.800]   taking it out in the first place? He's saving a lot of it. Let's just assume your spending
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.620]   needs grows by the Fed's 2% inflation rate from that $52K, and I'm going to do a 4% rule
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.720]   every year. Your portfolio does 6% a year, because it's diversified. In 20 years, you'd
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.080]   still have roughly $1.8 million. He's doing pretty good. Don't take this to the bank,
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.140]   because we haven't factored in taxes and a sequence of return risks. This is just a quick
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:49.140]   one. Yeah, especially if he's saving 50%, he's probably really only spending a 2% rule.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.480]   Zach is in a pretty good position. I don't know what happened to put him into this position,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.060]   but houses paid off, no mortgage. He did say inheritance. Yeah. It could have been something
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.360]   with the parents, which is not a great situation. Six figures in liquid savings, seven-figure
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.780]   portfolio. Financially, as a 38-year-old, you already kind of won the game. The question
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:16.780]   is, now what? First of all, enjoy yourself a little bit, maybe. You've won the game.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.840]   Some people would say stop playing, but you still have a potentially long time horizon.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.440]   You could have 50, 60 years to save and compound this money. What do you do? Go back to school,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.280]   start a business, take a risk, try a new job, travel for a few months, volunteer, maybe
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.680]   give some money to charity. The point is, do some stuff that makes you happy. You have
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.520]   plenty of capital and flexibility, but I think the first thing you need to do is you need
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.800]   a financial plan. You probably need to talk to a financial advisor to help you through
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.120]   this, because one of the things that a financial advisor can do is help you to define your
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.180]   goals. I think Zach is in a great position financially, but probably hasn't gone through
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.840]   and figured out, what do I actually want to do with this money? It seems like he doesn't
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.780]   know. You need someone to help you define what those goals are, put it down on paper,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.280]   create a financial plan, and figure out what exactly you want to do. That will allow you
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.080]   to spend the money wisely, enjoy yourself, and also keep up your standard of living along
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.960]   the way. That's the goal, tooting your own horn here as a wealth manager, but I think
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:21.080]   Zach needs some sort of financial plan. That's the thing. You can't figure out what you're
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.560]   going to do with that money or your goals if you don't have something that you're shooting
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560]   for.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.680]   He could also start a FIRE podcast, talking about early retirement and stuff.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   Well, the Internet comes after people who go FIRE because of an inheritance, though.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.400]   Yeah, no, I'm kidding. He'd have to leave that part out.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.460]   But again, great financial position. I don't know how that happened, but now you have to
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.520]   figure out, what am I going to do with this great position that I'm in? This is the hand
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.720]   that I've been dealt. Let's do some good here.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.640]   Yeah, I feel like I would maybe buy a business, a local business or something, a restaurant
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.240]   or something that I enjoyed. Because some people in the chat are talking about that.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.480]   At that young of an age, if you just quit working, unless you have a bunch of hobbies
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.400]   that keep you busy, you might end up actually worse off and not happy if you just don't
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.040]   really feel like you have anything to keep you on track.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.960]   Alternatively, if you don't have that type of personality, then like I said, maybe volunteer
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.880]   and do some charity work or something that can allow you to give back or keep you busy.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.760]   If you wanted to buy a business, maybe a banana stand. Are you an Impressive Development fan,
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.760]   Duncan?
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.840]   I am. There's always money in the banana stand.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.080]   All right. Let's do another one.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.240]   Zach, give us a call if you want to talk to someone. I'm not tooting my own horn here,
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.080]   but maybe it'd be helpful to walk through some of the financial plan. I think that'd
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   be helpful.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.320]   Right. Yeah. It sounds like he can only benefit from that.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:53.880]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Lee. "If I plan to retire early in my mid-40s,
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.160]   should I stay with a traditional 401(k) and do a Roth conversion after I retire at a lower
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.800]   bracket or change to Roth and get the Roth matching? I'm in the 22% tax bracket." I don't
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.000]   understand this question.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Lots of early retirement talk. Let's bring in the tax man himself, Bill Sweet.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.200]   Hey, Bill. Oh, you're muted.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.040]   Yeah, John. Gentlemen, it's good to be back to you in the new year. I was beginning to
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.920]   think you forgot about me, put me in a box. Good to be back. Let's do this.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.280]   All right. Early retirement. This is another, sounds like we do have a fire advocate here.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.640]   Early 40s, that's pretty young. Good for them for saving enough or having a lifestyle that-
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.320]   I'm in my early 40s. Should I retire?
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.080]   Me too. Personally, I could never do it, but I respect the move. Good for them for getting
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.040]   to that point. I could never do it. What are the tax implications? Because if you're retiring
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.560]   that early, the tax deferral stuff, the tax deferred retirement accounts kind of take
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.440]   on a different role here because you're not going to be able to utilize them as much as
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.160]   you would if you kept working. So what's the plan here?
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.400]   That's so interesting because I dialed right into the last part of that question, which
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.360]   was, should I switch to Roth to get the Roth matching? And I think what you gentlemen are
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.920]   not aware of, maybe because you skipped out on tax time with Bill and Bill at 1130 AM
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:10.360]   this morning, was the Secure Act 2.0, which Sleepy Joe signed into law for us on December
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:16.120]   30th, includes now the ability for your employer to match Roth contributions with matching
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.680]   Roth retirement funds. And that's very cool. That's new. And you guys know what's on the
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.560]   back tattoo. Very first show, the back tattoo came out. Go back to Portfolio Rescue 1 if
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.280]   you want to take a look. But Roth IRA conversion is what the back tattoo on my back says.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.960]   You know, Bill told us this last week. I didn't know that was a thing. So I've been in a Roth
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.720]   401(k) for the last couple of years. I did not realize that my contribution from Rich
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.800]   Holds Wealth Management was going into a traditional 401(k).
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.040]   That is correct. We've been screwing you over unintentionally all this time. But to be fair,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.440]   we were following the law. The law changed, right? But the only thing better than the
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.560]   Roth IRA conversion, guys, is matching Roth contributions, right? If I can get my employer
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.400]   match, my 4%, 6% safe harbor, whatever it is, if I can get that in a Roth account, not
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.560]   only is that free money, it's tax-free free money, right? It's double free. So that's
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.720]   what we need. And that's what I dialed in on.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   I like double free.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.600]   Yeah. So, but Ben, you sort of dialed in on, right, that I'm going to retire in my 40s.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.400]   And so what type of account, what kind of assets do I want to have if I'm taking distribution
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   to my 40s?
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.240]   Well, we don't know how old this person is. They didn't tell us, but let's say they're
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.160]   in their 20s, and they say, "I'm going to retire when I'm 40." And maybe your plans
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.920]   change at that point. But at that point, you probably have to have a lot more taxable dollars
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.560]   rather than, right, to get you through that until you've touched the Roth burden.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.480]   Yeah, yeah. Big ups, big ups. And I would definitely discuss that with a certified financial
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.400]   planner, Rich Holds Wealth Management or elsewhere. But conceptually and very broadly, I think
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.360]   if the question is, do I do traditional versus Roth? 100% the answer is Roth. And the reason
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.200]   is because of favorable distribution rules that occur for Roth assets vice traditional.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.360]   For a traditional IRA, if you take a distribution prior to 59.5, which is the year where your
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.360]   distribution should come qualified, you need to eat a 10% penalty plus the income tax,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.280]   right? And so if you're in a 22% tax bracket, you're paying five to state, all of a sudden
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.800]   your effective tax rate is like 40%, right, because you're paying that extra 10% early
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.040]   distribution penalties. Roth IRAs, there is a penalty for early distributions, but it
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.280]   only applies to the earnings portion. And assuming that on retirement, you take your
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.760]   Roth 401(k) rolled into the IRA, which is probably a good move, you get these favorable
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.200]   distribution rules allow you to access your basis first. So for somebody retiring in their
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.240]   40s, yeah, I think a Roth is grade number one. Might even be favorable, Ben, over a
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.840]   taxable brokerage account, although tax diversification is a great principle.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.040]   Right. So yeah, so you're saying if you roll over the IRA, you can still take out those
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.200]   contributions tax-free, penalty-free, and that's kind of what you can live on until
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.560]   you can get those other ones later on in your life.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.320]   Yes, your contributions. And just point of emphasis, only from an IRA. So you actually
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.540]   have to roll the money over to an IRA to take advantage of those rules. Roth 401(k) distributions
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.920]   are always pro rata. So you have to be careful with the implications.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:00.040]   And my other big advice here would be, beyond finances, have a plan for what you're going
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.240]   to do with your life. Because I think you could get bored real quick in your 40s if
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.680]   you don't have something that's going to keep you going. You can only go on so many trips
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.960]   and sit on the beach for so long before you get a little bored, I think. I know it sounds
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   great in theory, but if you haven't thought through like, "What am I going to actually
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.800]   do with my life?" You see a lot of these fire message boards things where they show people
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.880]   who say, "I planned for 15 years. I saved 7% of my income, and I realized I didn't live
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.480]   my life. I didn't have any hobbies. I didn't have many friends." So I think that is probably
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.640]   a bigger part of the situation than the finances of it.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.120]   I would agree 100%, Ben.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.760]   Right. All right, let's do another one.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.520]   Okay, up next we have a question from Eric. Also, Bill, I should make you put money in
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.360]   the swear jar for saying "Sleepy Joe." You're going to get so many hate political comments
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.200]   now in the YouTube comments.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.280]   It's a great nickname. Come on.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.760]   Okay. He should embrace it.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.320]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.680]   Up next we have, "We're 34 and 33 with two children, four and two, and expecting twins
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.560]   this summer. Both of us have Workplace 403B plans, Roth IRAs, and rollover IRAs from previous
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:10.280]   jobs. Taxable income in the 22% bracket. We currently have child credits of $6,000 a year,
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.080]   which will potentially jump to $12,000 a year in 2023. All else kept equal, our effective
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   rate in 2022 of 13% would drop to about 6.5% in 2023 with the additional tax credit. I
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.040]   only hear of arguments for Roth early in career due to income level, but also think young
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.480]   families have a unique window to contribute and convert to Roth at a very appealing, effective
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   rate up through their 30s and 40s. Does it make more sense, especially for young families,
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.960]   to use effective tax rate as the deciding factor?"
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   All right, before we get into the Roth stuff here, I want to talk a little bit about having
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.520]   twins to a family. First of all, four, two, and twins, Godspeed to you.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   That's a lot.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.440]   We have twins, George and Kate, are now five, going on six. We actually looked through some
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.440]   old photos, found this one recently. This one always makes me happy on the old... I'm
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.440]   so glad we got...
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.840]   Chunky monkeys, look at them.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.520]   Yes. We actually have a handful of friends and family members who have twins. So it's
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.840]   kind of like you're joining this club or fraternity. A few thoughts on having twins, because it
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.080]   is a totally different experience. The first three to four months basically was a blur,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.000]   complete blur. Life is very chaotic, but I think in the best way possible. It's really
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.560]   crazy to see the bond that twins have with one another. My twins have this unspoken language
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.960]   that they have that only the two of them understand. It's like they're on the same wavelength.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.440]   It's very bizarre.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   Be prepared for this one on a regular basis, especially with car seats. I'd be carrying
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.960]   both car seats. You know, you get the biceps from carrying babies. I probably heard this
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.840]   on a weekly basis. "Got your hands full there, huh? Huh?"
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   Yeah. Always hilarious. How about them apples?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.960]   If I felt like pulling it up, I'd say, "Literally, my hands are full." So I think you also have
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.840]   to put on a brave face, because all the other parents out there are going to be expecting
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.280]   you to be double tired and double miserable in those early months when you're not sleeping.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.520]   I think you have to pretend like you're not, right? Now, I was never miserable, but I was
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.960]   definitely tired. It actually didn't really happen for us that much. Things were pretty
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.720]   hectic, but my wife spent the first three months saying, "We've got to get these sleep
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.000]   trained," and we did.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.760]   High-quality laundry machine and dryer are key. With four kids, you're going to be doing
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.200]   lots of loads. You don't want to double up on the laundry machine even. So anyway, that's
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   my thoughts on twins.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   You're a guy, right?
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.480]   Yeah. Don't even think about the fact that you're going to have three, maybe four children
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.240]   in college at the same time. Just push that off. That's a future use problem. Don't even
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.760]   think about that now. The more practical stuff, how does the child tax credit stuff work here
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.900]   with four children? That's potentially a good thing for them, right? This could be a good
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.900]   deal?
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.360]   Yeah. My guy's math, I think, is a little bit off. He's using the prior child tax credit.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.760]   It's $2,000 a year here in 2023, which is no small shakes. But what the listener is
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   getting at is-
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   Oh, and they thought it was $6,000.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.960]   Yeah. So bad news right off the bat, but it's going to be okay. You're going to be so busy
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.120]   and sleep deprived you won't notice. But what they're getting at is these tax credits, they
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.280]   effectively wipe out your income tax. A tax credit, dollar for dollars, is more powerful
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.040]   than a deduction because instead of reducing your taxable income like a tax deduction does,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.960]   a mortgage tax deduction, what you're getting is these credits that offset your income tax,
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.940]   which is awesome. And you get to take $2,000 a year as the current law all the way up through
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.040]   age 15, when the child turns 16. So it's a pretty long-
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.080]   So they're getting eight grand a year with four kids.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.600]   Basically, yeah, to offset their taxes. And only part of that is refundable. And I think
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.400]   the listener's question is, "Hey, how do I use this? If this is going to offset a major
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.840]   tax, I'm going to be so sleep deprived I'm not going to notice. But should I flip the
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:39.480]   switch in the 22% bracket? Should I take some more income to use up this tax credit?" I
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.160]   think the answer is yes, but I would be careful because the last part of the question is really
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.120]   important on whether you use marginal versus effective tax rates. So to solve for this,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.080]   because I didn't have a lot of time to prepare, I made a famous chart, and I want to walk
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.840]   through it briefly. I know, Duncan's going to throw me out. So just to illustrate what's
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   going on here for podcast listeners, you get $100,000 of income, calculate the tax at $13,000,
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.320]   you could offset that by credits, let's say $6,000, you're left with $6,500 of tax. His
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.880]   question is, "Okay, cool, that means my effective tax rate is 6.5%, right?" $6,500 divided by
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.040]   $100,000 of income, that's where that comes from. So let's say that you add in a Roth
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.600]   versus a traditional, you were deducting, now you've got more income because you elected
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.000]   Roth, now what happens? You've got more income, you've got more tax, let's say that you still
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.820]   have the equivalent amount of child tax credit, but now your tax is $7,000 because you're
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:34.800]   at the 22% rate. And so his question is, "Cool, now my effective tax rate is 9.6, less 6.5%,
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.760]   that's only 3% more, right? Should I use that?" I think the answer is no, because the marginal
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.640]   tax rate, the extra dollar that comes in on top of everything else is the relevant number.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.640]   That is going to be 22%, so ultimately you're going to be paying 22% on your taxes, not
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.080]   3%, even if your effective tax rate is different. And the reason I think that's important to
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.880]   outline is that the child tax credit is partially refundable, you can get that back on a refund.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.200]   So I think the math is a little more complicated depending on how much the listeners actually
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.120]   earn, but I think the bottom line answer to your question, use your marginal tax rate
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.400]   when you're making these decisions, not your effective.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.040]   - Okay, I gotcha. Yeah, I see what you did there. That makes sense.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some jujitsu. And guys, I got, you just got to visualize this. You
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.680]   got to come live in my brain, come Inception style into here. You got to see it to believe
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   it.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.320]   - Yeah, yeah, 100%. I definitely get that.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   - Yeah.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   - I understand everything there.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.280]   - Duncan, when was the last time somebody asked you a tax question on the street from
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.200]   Portfolio Rescue? I couldn't stop thinking about that backstage.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.480]   - All the time. All the time.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.520]   - I mean, I did it last week. Pop quiz! You know, I came out from... And you got it right,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.440]   to your credit. So good for you. Good on you.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.040]   - All right, we got one more here.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.160]   - Okay, yeah. Last but not least, we have a question from Andrew. Is it possible to
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.600]   do a Roth 401k, traditional 401k, and backdoor Roth?
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.720]   - Okay, this person. Bill, you've been beating Roths over that. I mean, honestly, 90% of
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.960]   the questions this week had to do with Roth IRAs that came into my inbox. So people are
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.920]   trying to figure out like, okay, I want to max out as many tax for strategies as possible.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.520]   What are the combos here? And what are some of the knockout factors that would deter you
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.120]   from using any one of these?
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.560]   - Yeah, 100% you can. I would advise it. I think it's great fun. It's a great thing
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:17.280]   to do on a Friday night with a glass of Chardonnay. But what I would throw at a listener is to
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.000]   pay attention to the limits. The limits are very important. So for 401ks, the aggregate
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.840]   amount that goes salary contribution, salary deferral, is $22,500 per person per year if
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.080]   you're under the age of 50. That amount is split between traditional versus Roth IRAs,
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.920]   meaning that you cannot duplicate that amount. So if you do 22,500 in one, you can't do it
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.680]   in the other. You can do 11,250 in both. Some mix, but ultimately those are aggregated.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:48.320]   IRAs are not subject to the 401k limits. And so yes, you can do a traditional IRA contribution,
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   backdoor convert it if you're over the income limit. And you can do that in addition to
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.000]   the 401k, but the aggregate limit applies to the 401k. So that's the important distinction.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.200]   - So if I get another job that's remotely, and I'm doing another remote job on the side,
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   I can't open a new 401k and get that limit from there?
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.600]   - Ah, great question, Ben. So you brought in a second job. No, so this is interesting.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.560]   The salary deferral limit, which is what I talked about a second ago, that is limited.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.920]   You cannot replicate that at different jobs. However, you can in different jobs do a profit
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.240]   sharing contribution. So someone who might have a SEP IRA is considered a profit sharing
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.040]   plan. Those are not subject to either the IRA limits or the retirement penalty limits.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.960]   Again, distinct to the profit sharing element. So if you work multiple jobs, more than likely,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.320]   you're not going to give you a lot of matching contributions. But if you happen to get a
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.920]   4% match, yes, you can duplicate that in multiple places.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.800]   - If someone made me the tax retirement czar of this country, I would just give everyone
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   the same limit no matter what. Everyone gets $100,000 of tax deferral, whether it's an
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.200]   IRA, a SEP IRA, a 401k, a 403, whatever it is. I don't know why we have to have these
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   different limits.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.720]   - I'll go even further, Ben. When you and I retire in our mid-40s, I guess we missed
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.160]   the boat on that. But when we retire in our mid-50s, we are going to go lobby Congress
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.680]   in Washington and get this away from the employer. That'd be my thing. There is a retirement
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.960]   plan for federal employees called the TSP, the Thrift Savings Plan, one of the lowest
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   cost plans in the country.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.800]   - You're preaching to the choir here. My brother is part of it and I'm jealous of it all the
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   time.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.000]   - And it's open to federal employees. Why do we do this? Through employers, because it
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.840]   requires the employer. Me, as Red Hull Wealth Management, the plan sponsor, I have to set
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.280]   this up every year for the benefit of you guys, right? And our guy, John, I have to
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.200]   do this every year and certify stuff and pay bills and blah, blah, blah. Why don't we just
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.080]   do this through the federal government, encourage people to save? Like, screw the match. Maybe
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.600]   the company puts in the match, I don't know. But this should be open as a retirement program
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   for the people.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.640]   - You must be a reader of Wealth of Common Sense. It was one of my early blog posts.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.260]   And it's also one of the cheapest retirement plans. I think each fund is like two or three
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.640]   basis points of investment expenses. BlackRock runs it for them. It's an amazing program.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.880]   You get like five index fund choices. Yes, it should be open to all Americans.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.400]   - Government employees, sponsors, yeah, the whole thing. So I'm with it. And so we are
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400]   going to go to Washington.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.640]   - How would companies use their retirement plans to try to lure talent?
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   - Yep, yep. And for the inauguration day in 2036, meet me there on the steps of the White
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.280]   House. We're going to go meet Chuck Schumer, Kristen Gillibrand. We're going to go right
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.680]   up to Sleepy Joe, still be president and get this thing signed into law. Let's do it. Who's
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   with me?
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.440]   - Okay, another dollar in the square yard.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.800]   - You can Zoom me into that one. I'll watch from Zoom.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.960]   - I think he's going to be like in his hundreds.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.440]   - We'll do it live. We'll do a live show from DC.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.440]   - Let's do it.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.920]   - All right. If you have any tax questions for Bill, any of us, Duncan, keep them coming.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.040]   - They take me out of my box when we get more than 10 a week, so.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.280]   - Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Remember new compounded friends tomorrow. If you have something
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.000]   in podcast form, leave us a review, leave us a comment below. I respond to all of them
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.760]   unless they're mean, then I don't.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   - Yeah.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.400]   - Compoundmerch is idontshop.com. Remember, keep those questions coming.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.720]   - We've got some new stuff coming. We've got some new stuff coming in the shop. Keep your
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.720]   eyes peeled.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.720]   - All right.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   - Yeah.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.840]   - Are you still hiring? Are you still hiring a tax person?
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.320]   - Yeah. We're looking. We're looking. It's a hard time to hire somebody in tax, but yeah,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.840]   if you've got skills, get on our radar.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.920]   - Let us know. Thanks everyone who showed up to the live chat as always, and we will
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.920]   see you next time.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.920]   - See you, everyone.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.760]   - Yep. Big shouts to Eric. Congrats on the babies.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.560]   - Yeah. Congrats.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   - Yeah. Thanks.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   - Thanks.

[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   - Thanks.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.620]   you
