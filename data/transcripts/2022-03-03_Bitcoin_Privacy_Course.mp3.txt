[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.100]   Welcome to this introduction to my newest course called Private Cryptocurrencies, How
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.020]   to Buy, Own and Use Bitcoin Like a True Radical.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.860]   My name is Josh Rascheitz, host of the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.060]   And I have here today with me Gabriel Custodiate, host of the Watchman's Guide to Privacy podcast.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.060]   Gabriel, welcome.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.740]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.020]   Yeah, nice to be here, Josh.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.660]   So I thought what we'd do is take a quick promotional and introductory video here, talking
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.300]   about the new course that we have launched, that we're launching together.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.800]   The scenario that we designed this course around is very simple.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   The basic idea is this.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.160]   Imagine this, your bank accounts are frozen.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.140]   You must flee the country with only what you carry.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.660]   Gold is suspicious and cash has limits.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.980]   You cross the world and find a public computer, download a single program, type from memory
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.900]   a private key.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.080]   You now have access to $2 million worth of Bitcoin, unattached to your identity, tucked
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.140]   away for just this scenario and the knowledge to buy, trade and convert it into any local
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.020]   currency in the world.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.220]   Now Gabriel, I was thinking about how this particular course came about.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.300]   And as I remember it, I think I came to you with this scenario and I said, Gabriel, here's
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.540]   what I am working on.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.940]   I really want to figure out how to use Bitcoin to its fullest as a last ditch form of money.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.860]   A form of money where with nothing other than a few code words in your head, you can cross
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.780]   any border in the world, go anywhere and have access to your money.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.980]   But I don't know how to do it.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.740]   And that was when I came to you and I said, let's figure it out.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.800]   And of course from there, you've taken and we've worked on an outline and we've got an
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.580]   exciting course to offer.
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.400]   So what I thought would be interesting is let's start at the beginning and go over some
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.340]   of the content that we're going to be covering and most importantly give an outline of the
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.420]   scope of the course.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.620]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.300]   So I would say, Josh, that this came about partly upon reflecting how people talk about
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.140]   Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as this radical alternative to current finance.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.140]   We've seen recently with the banning of the SWIFT system for Russian people, not just
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.260]   the Russian government, but Russian people of the situation in Canada with people's bank
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.100]   accounts being shut down.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.180]   We've seen and we've heard that cryptocurrencies can be a radical alternative, but most people
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.740]   are not actually using them in that way.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.100]   Most people have them in these centralized exchanges, which are antithetical to Bitcoin
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.360]   and cryptocurrencies.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.660]   And so I've read all the books on Bitcoin about people saying that this is an alternative.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.140]   This is going to take down the Fed, etc.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.980]   But then they don't really explain how to own and to use Bitcoin like a radical, in
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.660]   other words, self in a self-sovereign way where you own your own private keys, where
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.460]   you have access to these things yourself and where you do it privately.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.460]   And privacy, of course, is important because that which is surveyed can be controlled.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.500]   So let me tell you a little bit about the course.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.860]   Basically, we are going to do a comprehensive mini course on Bitcoin with an emphasis on
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.860]   privacy.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.540]   We're going to be talking about what Bitcoin is, how to use it, how to acquire it, how
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.260]   to engage with decentralized and centralized exchanges and what all of these things are.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.820]   We're going to talk about how to store it safely with or without hardware wallets and
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.040]   software wallets.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.200]   And so all of this was with a privacy focus.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.060]   What do I mean by privacy focus?
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.700]   Well, my definition of privacy is to have these things have Bitcoin without any attachment
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.020]   to your identity.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.260]   That is the goal, whether that is your IP address or your name or any other distinguishing
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.260]   piece of information.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.820]   Now, that's difficult and there are various ways to do it, which is why I need some time
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.440]   in order to unpack this stuff.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.180]   And so let me describe a few of the things that we'll be talking about.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.340]   We're going to go over wallets, hardware wallets and software wallets.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.040]   We're going to talk about Bitcoin ATMs and how to use them and how to use them privately.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.140]   We're going to talk about getting your Bitcoin out of a public exchange like Coinbase and
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.820]   obscuring these coins through mixers and through conversion to privacy coins and back into
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.820]   Bitcoin.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.960]   It's not as complicated as it seems.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.700]   We're going to cover briefly what you need to know about mining Bitcoin.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.860]   We're going to talk about how to acquire Bitcoin from other people, where to do that and the
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.260]   best method.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.340]   We'll talk about and by the way, throughout all of this, we're going to define our terms.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.820]   We're going to explain things in the simplest way possible.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.900]   I don't want anybody to be left out.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.140]   We're going to assume no prior knowledge.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.980]   And we'll also be talking about how to use decentralized exchanges to trade for other
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.980]   coins.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.980]   Important point.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.700]   This is not just about Bitcoin.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.660]   We can use these strategies and we will be using these strategies for other coins, alt
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.500]   coins as they're called.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.660]   We're going to talk about things like how to memorize your seed phrase, very practical
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.140]   things about the responsibilities of owning your private keys, which is part of the process
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.260]   of having them privately.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.820]   And we'll be discussing a number of other things along the way.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.860]   And what I want to emphasize in this course is a few things.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.380]   First of all, it is practical, right?
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.080]   We're not talking theory of Bitcoin.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.220]   We're talking about how I've gone out to as many ATMs as I can, and I've learned how to
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.320]   approach this in the best way possible.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.700]   We're not going to be talking about the theory of how to use Bitcoin privately.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.500]   You're going to see on my screen the entire time what I'm doing, what wallet I'm using,
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.300]   why I'm using this wallet, how I'm doing all of this over the course of several hours while
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.360]   I explain it.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.480]   Another part of this course, another thing to emphasize is that this has been a long
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.940]   time in the making.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.980]   I've been ruminating on this course for years now, and I've talked to Bitcoin experts.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.820]   I have consulted with people.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.340]   And one thing I've noticed is that there is really a dearth of knowledge about owning
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.520]   Bitcoin like a true radical in a private way.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.660]   And so I did the work and I figured out all these methods, and I'm happy to share them
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.180]   with you, a kind of accumulated wisdom about my trials in exploring this topic.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.940]   Another thing is that this course is designed to be as teachable as possible.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.020]   In other words, I am trying to walk you through in the most basic terms possible how to do
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020]   all these steps.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.400]   I'm going to try not to skip anything, not to use overly technical vocabulary.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.580]   I want this above all to be completely comprehensible to everybody.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.180]   And then the last thing I'll point out is that we will have a Q&A afterwards.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.020]   So if you have any questions about the process, you will have a chance to ask that of me.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:39.380]   And I think that's going to be exciting because I really believe that in many aspects of finance,
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.420]   if you'll go just the extra mile, you'll get a lot more benefit from it.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.820]   Bitcoin is a powerful technology, but this is kind of the missing piece of how to do
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.900]   it privately.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.260]   It's even more powerful.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.360]   It's certainly powerful if you have it in the normal way, the easiest ways, etc.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   But it's just so much more powerful if you go the extra step.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.740]   And I think that you mentioned some of the examples, right?
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.540]   But right now there are people fleeing Ukraine.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:13.060]   And I tell you what, it's a whole lot better if you have some private money along the way.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.460]   Gabriel, as you've been researching this so intensively, and I really respect your academic
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:25.620]   comprehensiveness, what has been the hardest of the problems to crack?
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.900]   What for you has been the most difficult thing to find a solution for?
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.260]   Well, yeah, that's a good question.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.460]   I don't know that any one thing is too difficult.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.080]   The problem is that this is a constantly evolving scene.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.060]   So you have exchanges, decentralized exchanges that come and go.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:52.660]   You have Bitcoin ATMs that at one point were okay with a burner number, and now they are
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.660]   not.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.540]   And so it's a matter of testing just enough things to get a sense of...
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.300]   Do more together this holiday in a new Chevy.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.060]   Take on more adventure in the strong and capable Chevy Silverado.
