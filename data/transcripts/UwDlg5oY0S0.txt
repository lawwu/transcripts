[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Maybe we could take a moment and talk about atrazine and its effect on male sexual behavior
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.680]   in amphibia to the sperm studies because Tyrone Hayes is a wonderful researcher who established
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.160]   a link through his research between atrazine exposure and male sexual behavior of amphibia.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.760]   Could you elaborate on that?
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.360]   Tyrone first caught frogs in the wild, in environments that were more or less exposed
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.640]   to atrazine, and showed effects on development and sexual behavior.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.680]   Then in his lab, he actually exposed them.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.360]   So he knew exactly who was exposed and how much.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.840]   And he showed that, and I can't tell you what percent or what, you know, but a significant
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.200]   number of frogs exposed to this pesticide atrazine chose to mate with other male frogs.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.680]   Tried to mate with other male frogs, presumably unsuccessfully.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.800]   Well, they mounted them.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.360]   He has photos of the males mounting males.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.120]   That's a remarkable result.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:18.380]   It's been kind of, you know, used and misused out there in the media and in popular culture.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.240]   But if nothing else, it suggests that the organization of the neural circuits and neuroendocrine
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.360]   pathways that control sexual, I don't want to say partner, because it's mating, frogs
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.360]   aren't monogamous, but sexual preference are significantly impacted by this atrazine.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   Yes.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.560]   And it suggests that there are other environmental chemicals as well.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.100]   And I don't know if we'll have time to go there, but I did work on neurodevelopmental
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.000]   outcomes in relation to prenatal phallic exposure.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.360]   And so I think the overarching idea here is that the brain, like the genitals, is sexually
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.200]   dimorphic.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.600]   And there's many people, by the way, who will take offense at that.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Really?
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.240]   I think there's, I mean, going back to the work of Frank Beach in the psychology department
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.680]   at UC Berkeley, showed this in beagles.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.800]   It's been shown in pretty much every species.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.920]   But it's not a better or worse.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.760]   I think this is what people need to hear, like dimorphic does not mean better or worse.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.760]   It means different.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   Right.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   Right.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.920]   And that there are, for example, advantages to spatial reasoning in a male, which are
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.120]   related to testosterone, right?
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.120]   You know that.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.640]   I mean, I think there, yeah, I mean, my understanding of this literature, and I'm not an expert
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.880]   in this particular aspect, which is the behavioral phenotypes, but, you know, like the medial
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.480]   preoptic area of the hypothalamus is known to be sexually dimorphic, dependent on testosterone,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.280]   converted into estrogen during development, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.460]   And there's just so much evidence of this.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:13.060]   How it links to behaviors, I think, can be reasonably placed into ethologically relevant,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.980]   evolutionarily logical arguments when talking about rodents or beagles or even rhesus macaque
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.660]   monkeys.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.680]   I think where people get a bit inflamed is when people try and take the sexual dimorphisms
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.440]   that have been observed in animal brains, or even in human brains, and tack those to
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.420]   specific abilities or lesser abilities.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.800]   I think that's when people sort of go, wait a second, like, I have much better sense of
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   direction than my husband.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.400]   And you go, well, yeah, like, you know, and then you go, well, does that mean that she
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.760]   has higher testosterone than him?
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.360]   And then maybe, and then, and pretty soon you're in almost a no man's land, a no person's
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.840]   land of confounding variables, right?
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.800]   And I really appreciate that you raised this.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.840]   And also that you said it and I didn't, because I feel safer that way.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.260]   But look, there is a very simple, outdated questionnaire, and it's play behavior.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.600]   It's called the PSAI.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   It's been used for years.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Have you heard of it?
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.640]   It's a rough and tumble play.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   Yes.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   Yes.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.460]   And there are 24 questions on there, and they are sexually dimorphic, I guess you could
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.660]   say that, you know, my child likes to play with dolls, my child likes to play dress up,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.920]   my child likes to play rough and tumble, et cetera.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:43.400]   And we gave that questionnaire to our population and looked at the answers that the mothers
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   gave, both in our population, by the way, and a Swedish population of a colleague there,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.520]   Carl Bornahag and Gustav Bornahag.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:03.040]   And what we found, higher phthalate levels, these anti-androgenic phthalates were associated
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.120]   with less masculine male typical play in our male boys.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120]   So-
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.320]   This is phthalate exposure to the mom, baby is born in the young human child.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320]   I think it was four years of age.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.720]   Four years of age.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   Less rough and tumble type play among the boys whose mothers were exposed to more phthalates
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.940]   during a critical period of development.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.040]   Now you can see that's a politically loaded issue now.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.240]   I mean, you know, well, I think we're, I mean, let's have some fun with this in the scientific
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.360]   sense.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   The notion of dimorphism is, you know, okay, male and female brains are different, right?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.200]   And male, female defined in those, almost all those studies as presence of a Y chromosome.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.600]   And then people say, well, there's some, there's XYY, and then there's XXY, okay.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.440]   But most of the time you're talking about XX chromosome or XY chromosomes at birth.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.340]   Forget everything else for the moment.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.020]   These are always distributions.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.440]   This is what I think people need to know.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.100]   We're not talking about, these are not, this is not, you know, two hills of data separated
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.440]   by a valley.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.960]   These are overlapping distributions, right?
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.960]   So you get males with a "female-like" distribution, you get females with a "male-like" distribution.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.760]   And I think as long as we acknowledge that, then we're just talking statistics.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.480]   We're not placing any cultural or any value on it really whatsoever.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.720]   But if you could make the analog to the intergenital distance, it's kind of similar.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.960]   You know, you have the same exposure, phthalate exposure, you have something changed statistically.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.440]   We don't see huge differences in the boys' genitals.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.320]   And we don't see huge, I don't, we know, these kids have not been scanned, so we don't know
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   how their brains look.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.940]   But based on their answers, we don't see huge differences.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.940]   We see tendencies.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:05.160]   We see they are more likely, if they had been exposed to these phthalates, to want to play
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.840]   dress up and have tea parties.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.840]   More likely.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.280]   Doesn't mean that they're all going to, but that's the direction and so on.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.480]   So I think we have to just think about more likely, not absolute.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:24.720]   [music]
