[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.180]   Recently, the Huberman Lab hosted a live event
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.900]   at the Chicago Theater in Chicago, Illinois.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.540]   The event consisted of a lecture entitled
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.800]   The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.120]   followed by a question and answer session.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.380]   We wanted to make sure that the question and answer session
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.780]   was available to everybody,
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.060]   regardless of who could attend in person.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.020]   I also want to make sure to thank the sponsors
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.440]   at that event, which were AG1 and 8Sleep.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.720]   and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.880]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.240]   is to make sure that the temperature
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.980]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.560]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.240]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.920]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.060]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.000]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400]   With 8Sleep, you can program the temperature
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.680]   of your sleeping environment in the beginning, middle,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.960]   and end of your night.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.120]   It has a number of other features,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.980]   like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.380]   and slow wave sleep that you get,
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.600]   things that are essential to really dialing in
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.160]   the perfect night's sleep for you.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.760]   I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.440]   for well over two years now,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.340]   and it has greatly improved my sleep.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.120]   I fall asleep far more quickly.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.320]   I wake up far less often in the middle of the night,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.160]   and I wake up feeling far more refreshed than I ever did
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.760]   prior to using an 8Sleep mattress cover.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.040]   If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.680]   you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.560]   to save $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.380]   8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.460]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.320]   Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.060]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.700]   I've been taking AG1 since 2012,
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.520]   so I'm delighted that they sponsored the live event.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.240]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.540]   and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.320]   is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.880]   That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.700]   of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.760]   to ensure optimal mental health,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.920]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.320]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.600]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.140]   to claim a special offer.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.920]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.700]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.080]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.880]   to claim that special offer.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.680]   And now without further ado,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160]   the question and answer session from our live event
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.960]   at the Chicago Theater in Chicago, Illinois.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:42.900]   I turned 70 soon.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.640]   What is your best advice to keep my brain healthy
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.480]   in old age?
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.940]   Terrific question.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.240]   The advice I would give to you
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.060]   as somebody about to reach 70 is the same advice
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.080]   I give to anybody,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.760]   which is that essentially all of the things
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.120]   that improve cardiovascular health
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.840]   and perfusion of your bodily tissues
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.540]   are going to improve functionality of the brain.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.540]   Because of course, the brain as a rich consumer of fuel
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.760]   requires very good portals to deliver those fuels
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.540]   and that capillaries, microcapillaries and arteries
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.280]   and so forth need to be clean and clear.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.120]   That's the big one.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.800]   This is why I think the prescription now
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.780]   is generally accepted.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.720]   And here I'm borrowing from my friend Peter Attia,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.000]   but about 150 or maybe as much as 200 minutes
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.040]   of so-called zone two cardio per week movement
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.440]   that you can just barely carry out a conversation
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.960]   is going to be very useful.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.280]   One thing that's often not discussed
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.360]   is that load bearing exercise of some sort
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.640]   is going to be better provided your body can tolerate it,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.520]   but you should do something that you can do consistently
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.620]   over those long durations without injuring yourself.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.360]   But there's a very interesting literature
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.580]   about how load bearing movements
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.480]   actually generate the release of hormones,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.200]   yes, hormones from bone
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.100]   that actually cross the blood brain barrier
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.100]   and may influence health of neurons in brain areas
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.200]   such as the hippocampus.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.720]   And there I'm extending from preclinical data
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.980]   in animals to humans,
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.680]   but there's some human data starting to emerge
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   that that's true.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.880]   Also true, and there's a wonderful paper out
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.120]   just today or yesterday from Dr. Andy Galpin's lab
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.980]   and collaborators talking about how
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.460]   if you look at cognitive health,
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.240]   it's highly correlated with things that relate to strength.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.900]   And that is not to say that you should just do
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.080]   strength training exercise,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.520]   but we know that all people, truly all people
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.380]   should be doing some sort of resistance training
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.080]   two or three times per week.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.560]   And we know that grip strength
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.160]   and increasing asymmetry in grip strength
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.440]   between the two hands is one of the indicators
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.420]   of deficits in control from the brain out to the periphery
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.320]   and it's correlated with cognitive decline.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.360]   There's also some interesting data
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   about how when the feet become floppy and kind of flaccid
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.400]   or the lack of ability to extend one's toes.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.720]   I'm still working, I've been wearing this toe spreader thing.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   Has anyone tried those?
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.240]   Those hurt, those hurt.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.560]   I broke this foot a bunch of times,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.840]   but I'll tell you, when you get better
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.920]   at spreading your toes, it's really exciting.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.680]   And it's really exciting for several reasons.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.240]   It's really exciting 'cause there's more stability
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.600]   in your feet, you can run and move
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.320]   and do things better without pain.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.520]   But in addition to that, believe it or not,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.160]   just as one of the first things that they're gonna do
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.040]   when you come into this world
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.240]   is scrape the bottom of your foot
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.640]   and look for the Babinski reflex,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.500]   which is a neural transmission reflex, as all reflexes are.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.080]   But it's testing essentially the health
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.600]   of the nervous system that over time,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.280]   again, there are many correlates of dementia,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.680]   many, many correlates of dementia,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.040]   but an inability to finally control the extremities
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.120]   is certainly one of them.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.800]   So strength training, cardiovascular training,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.280]   these are kind of stereotyped answers for your question,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.680]   and yet those are really the prime movers
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.880]   against cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.180]   And then of course, there's, you know,
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.860]   I'd be remiss if I didn't throw in something
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.660]   that was a little bit more edgy 'cause that's what I do.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.840]   You know, there are interesting data about the use of drugs
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.120]   to increase acetylcholine transmission, right?
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.320]   I mean, I was visiting a Nobel Prize winner at Columbia
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.060]   to learn about his incredible work some years ago
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.660]   and saw that he chewed no fewer
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.120]   than five pieces of Nicorette gum,
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.560]   something I don't recommend, during this short meeting.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.520]   And I said, "What is this all about?"
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.140]   He said, "Well, you know, I don't smoke anymore
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.360]   "because I don't want lung cancer."
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.100]   But, you know, he said, "Nicotine is protective
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.880]   "against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's."
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.940]   I was like, "How can that be?"
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.380]   And he said, "Well, you know, it decreases neuromodulation.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.020]   "Dopamine and acetylcholine correlated
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.060]   "with cognitive decline, keeping your brain sharp,"
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.260]   and so on and so forth.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.740]   So I'm not encouraging people to take nicotine.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.000]   It increases blood pressure, vasoconstriction.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.060]   But it's an interesting consideration.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.100]   You know, some of the emerging cholinergic
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.780]   and dopaminergic drugs, the ways to increase
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.500]   acetylcholine and dopamine are certainly intriguing.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.020]   And I won't tell you who that person is,
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.540]   but his name is Richard Axel.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.240]   Next question, yeah.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.660]   "How can I optimize sleep while working
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.880]   "24-hour shifts as a firefighter?
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.260]   "24 hours on, 48 hours off."
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.440]   Okay, and this probably also pertains to new parents,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.560]   and it probably also pertains to anyone
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.280]   that's going through a particularly stressful time
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.240]   where you're micro-awaking throughout the night,
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.640]   so not just firefighters.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.480]   So what do we know?
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.920]   We know, based on really good data,
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.600]   that shift work is bad for us.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.840]   It's just bad.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.400]   We're a diurnal species.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.520]   We're not nocturnal, but thank you, thank you,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.200]   thank you, shift workers, because you essentially
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.120]   keep us all safe and make the world go round.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.840]   And so we need you, and we want you healthy.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.900]   So one of the main things is that you can
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.560]   make sure that you stay on the same sleep-wake schedule,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.000]   excuse me, for at least two weeks.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.540]   It's the swing shift that's really the worst.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.720]   You can tell your boss I said that.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.080]   And if they won't agree, and you're doing this
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.640]   24 hour on, 24 hour off, there are a couple of things
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.720]   that are really important.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.860]   First of all, the main way to wake up your nervous system,
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.300]   even though it might not feel like a triple espresso,
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.100]   is going to be that light exposure to the eyes.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.440]   And if you can't get it from sunlight,
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.840]   it's going to be from any bright artificial light.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.040]   I'm not a huge proponent of the daylight simulators.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.000]   They're very expensive.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.120]   You can simply buy a 900 lux LED far more inexpensively.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.680]   I don't have any relationship to any company
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.280]   that sells these, but you can find them on Amazon
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.880]   or wherever you happen to prefer to purchase things.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.880]   Or you can just get really close to a bright light
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.280]   anytime you're trying to wake up,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.080]   even if you don't feel that it helps you wake up very much,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.120]   mostly for the melatonin suppression,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.960]   'cause bright light will very acutely suppress melatonin.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.200]   And then the real question from shift workers
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.080]   always seems to be, should I catch up on sleep,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.760]   or is that going to be problematic?
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.840]   Should I just stay up into the next cycle?
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.280]   And the answer there is a little bit nuanced,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.920]   but the best answer I can give across the board
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.540]   is if this is a pattern that you're going to be in regularly
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.400]   over, say, months or years,
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.140]   then get whatever sleep you can.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.260]   Get whatever sleep you can.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.560]   If it's something that you're doing somewhat acutely,
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.920]   like you're traveling to Europe
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.100]   and you're just gonna force yourselves
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.800]   to stay up a day and a half,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   then in that case, I would say,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.320]   no need to get the maximum amount of sleep.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.280]   Just try and stay with the local schedule.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.060]   We have an entire episode about shift work
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.460]   that somehow maybe didn't get as much recognition
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.560]   as it should have for shift workers,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.060]   and we'll try and get it out in better form.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.840]   We don't always succeed in top-carting things
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.940]   in a way that gets them out to the most people.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.320]   One thing I will say is an opportunity to announce
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.560]   that our website, HebrewnLab.com, is completely revamped,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.640]   so it's highly searchable.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.600]   It will take you to exact timestamps,
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.400]   and now you can segregate out timestamps
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.000]   from newsletters, from all this stuff,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   so thanks to a lot of effort by my amazing team,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.520]   you can now navigate that site to real precision.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.760]   So if you wanna say ADHD, Adderall, kids, yes, no,
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.820]   for instance, it will take you to precise timestamps
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.720]   that will address those issues.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.560]   Next question, please.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.220]   How does hypnosis therapy work?
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.880]   Well, this is a very interesting topic to me
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.520]   because my colleague, associate chair of psychiatry
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.520]   at Stanford, David Spiegel, is a world expert in hypnosis
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.360]   and its neural underpinnings and its use
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.160]   for clinical applications.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.760]   His father was a hypnotist, also a psychiatrist,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.120]   and when people hear hypnotism,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.800]   they think of stage hypnotism and being up on stage
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.020]   and doing things you don't want to in front of other people,
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.060]   but really, when we're talking about clinical applications
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.580]   or wellness applications of hypnosis,
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.780]   we're talking about self-directed hypnosis.
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.500]   I really wish there was a better name
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.940]   because I don't think hypnosis is going to advance
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.240]   very far as a field, frankly,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.400]   because everyone thinks hypnosis,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.120]   and it would be like if psychedelics
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.500]   were just called drugs, right?
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.400]   We were taught in the '80s that drugs are bad
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.620]   and that your brain on drugs looks like an omelet
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.100]   and that's bad, and if you like omelets,
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.260]   if they're still bad, and drugs of abuse are bad,
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.300]   and actually, I hope we can talk briefly
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.020]   about psychedelics at some point because I do think
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.400]   there's a little bit of a runaway train
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.000]   around the topic of psychedelics now.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.740]   I think we need to be very careful
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.700]   how we approach that entire landscape,
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.200]   but hypnosis essentially works by allowing someone
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.300]   to place their own brain into this very unique state.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.260]   Earlier, we were talking about neuroplasticity,
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.840]   and we talked about the fact that neuroplasticity
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.160]   involves intense focus followed by deep rest
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.260]   in the form of deep sleep or non-sleep deep rest,
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.980]   maybe even Rick Rubin-ing it
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.940]   and just kind of like laying there.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.940]   Hypnosis is different because hypnosis is in a state
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.060]   in which your focus is very narrow,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.980]   the context is very narrow, but you're very, very relaxed.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.860]   So maybe the Rubin example of being brain active
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.860]   and body very still is a bit more like hypnosis, to be fair.
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.060]   Why would it be the case that David Spiegel and his dad
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.380]   have literally a tool that is approved by the
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.700]   psychiatric associate,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.360]   the major American Psychiatric Association,
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.700]   where they can figure out how hypnotizable you are
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.220]   by having you look up and try and close your eyelids
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.260]   while continuing to look up,
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.900]   the so-called Spiegel Eye Roll Test.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.380]   Sounds pretty wacky, right?
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.520]   This is like TikTok level wacky.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.380]   Well, the reason is you have cranial nerves,
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.820]   so they sit more or less near your neck,
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.380]   that allow you to direct your focus, your eyes upward,
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.100]   and then you have cranial nerves that have your eyes go down
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.060]   and the cranial nerves that drive your eyes up
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.820]   are associated with alertness and eyes open, no surprise,
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.340]   and the cranial nerves that are associated with
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.360]   pointing your eyes down and closing your eyelids
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.680]   are associated with what?
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.740]   With drowsiness, sleep, and lack of alertness.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.780]   There's sort of a push-pull in the autonomic nervous system.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.780]   And Spiegel, Spiegel's daddy and him figured out,
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.000]   'cause they're geniuses,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.740]   that if somebody can maintain upward gaze
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.780]   while closing their eyelids, two things happen.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.720]   One, you'll see the whites of their eyes,
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.420]   and it's pretty creepy.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.720]   Two, that means they're highly hypnotizable
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.740]   because that is a reflection of the probability
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.340]   that they can enter a brain state
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.340]   in which they are both very awake and very relaxed.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.540]   Pretty cool.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.260]   Now, if that sounds kind of wacky
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.520]   'cause you're just looking at the periphery,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   keep in mind that one of the primary entry points
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.780]   for diagnosing concussion is to shine a light in one eye
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.500]   and have that pupil constrict
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.060]   and then see whether or not the other pupil constricts,
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.140]   the so-called consensual or pupillary reflex.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.980]   Although technically,
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.040]   and I've been bothered by this from day one,
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.880]   it should be called the non-consensual pupil reflex
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.860]   'cause the other eye doesn't have a choice
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.180]   if everything's working.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   In any case, if you have a hard hit to the head,
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.660]   you'll see that you shine light in one eye,
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.080]   the pupil constricts in the other one,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.460]   stays really dilated and then you go,
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.200]   okay, get this person in the emergency room
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.840]   because there's been a severing of the connections
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.980]   between the two sides of the brain.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.820]   So looking in the eyes and trying to deduce
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.360]   what might be happening more centrally
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.980]   within the caverns of the skull and the brain
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.120]   is not a new thing.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.080]   It is a primary diagnostic tool in neurology.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.760]   It's also how your parents knew that you were taking drugs
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.600]   when you came in the door
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.260]   'cause your pupils were like that big.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.920]   And that reflects a difference in autonomic arousal
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.600]   in basically stimulants as people dilate their pupils.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.920]   This is also why the story about belladonna,
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.120]   people intentionally dilating their pupils
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.400]   to trick people into thinking
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.120]   that they were attracted to them.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.560]   Fought about this one a lot too.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.920]   It's like not a precursor to good relationship.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.320]   It's like someone's using their physiology
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.640]   to pretend that they're attracted
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.160]   so the other person thinks that they're attracted
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.440]   so that they might become attracted.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.840]   Anyway, it's a recipe for failure,
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.940]   almost as bad as most of the dating apps.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.000]   Well, I wouldn't know I'm not on them,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.800]   but from what I hear.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.520]   Okay, so where were we?
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.120]   Hypnosis.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.220]   When you are in a state of elevated attention
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.220]   but very relaxed, guess what?
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.640]   Neuroplasticity occurs much faster
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.380]   because you're essentially marrying the two states
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.840]   that are normally divorced
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.760]   which are heightened levels of attention first
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.780]   and then depressed.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.880]   You're essentially putting the nervous system
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.440]   into a more, I wouldn't call it hyperplastic state,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.720]   but a more plastic state.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.320]   And for people that are highly hypnotizable,
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.800]   the success rates at, for instance,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   smoking cessation, pain relief are pretty impressive.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.560]   Spiegel Lab has published a number of these.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.400]   So I think self-hypnosis is a very interesting tool.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.900]   I just hope that they rename it
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.640]   so that it stands a chance of getting off the ground.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.720]   I mean, one of the things that you learn
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.240]   as a public-facing educator is that what things are called
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.280]   has a great impact on whether or not
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.760]   they achieve any kind of use in the world.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.600]   Hence why I decided to swallow the difficult pill
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.440]   of partially renaming yoga nidra as non-sleep deep rest.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.760]   I don't like to do that.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.240]   Yoga nidra has more than a thousand year history,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.400]   but it's when people hear yoga nidra,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.040]   unless they are very open-minded, they hear magic carpet.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.260]   They hear levitation.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.160]   And it's unfortunate, and that's not how I feel,
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.240]   but for years I talked about yoga nidra, it's so cool.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.940]   It's like sleep state, but it's like, yeah, yoga nidra, okay.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.160]   But if you come from a culture
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.280]   where that's discussed, they're all about it.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.240]   And so non-sleep deep rest, you know, I felt like,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   all right, leave my name out of it.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.560]   You know, I'll be dead eventually.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.300]   I mean, I'm in this line of advisors, right?
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.580]   I'm like approaching 50.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.880]   I'm like, I'm winning in my lineage.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.300]   But should I be fortunate enough to, you know,
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.160]   live past, you know, bullet cancer or car crash far enough,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.240]   then, you know, NSDR hopefully will persist,
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.600]   and I don't need a piece of it.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.060]   It's just the hope is that people will learn
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.300]   to put themselves into brain states that can be adaptive
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.700]   for them, so it'd be nice if someone could come up
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.480]   with something other than hypnosis.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.200]   I think Spiegel would agree.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.640]   Super interested in psychedelics as medicine,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.600]   to be done with somebody with experience,
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.000]   worried about unlocking mental health conditions.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.400]   Yeah, you should be.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.800]   What does the research say, and what are your thoughts?
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.640]   Okay.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.880]   Barbed wire question, we like that.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.320]   Psychedelics, well, let's just back up a little bit
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.800]   and acknowledge one thing that's more important
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.640]   than psychedelics or anything else
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.040]   when it comes to rewiring the brain,
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.980]   which is that ultimately rewiring of the brain
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.160]   is about shifts in neuromodulators.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.560]   Dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.660]   norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.760]   And it's no coincidence that, you know, SSRI,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.800]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.480]   have been one of the major entry points
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.140]   for attempts to treat things like depression
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.080]   over the last 20, 30 years or more.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.680]   When I was in college, there was,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.400]   that's when the book Listening to Prozac came out.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.760]   But prior to that, there's a long history of drugs,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.560]   prescription drugs in that case,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.320]   to change levels of neuromodulators like serotonin
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.240]   or acetylcholine or dopamine in an attempt
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.680]   to cure or treat a disease.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.800]   But keep in mind, despite the varied success
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.240]   of SSRIs, a topic unto itself,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.040]   that there's a strong belief,
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.320]   and there has been for a long time,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.760]   that if SSRIs worked, it wasn't because
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.080]   the depressed brain is deficient in serotonin,
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.960]   but rather because increasing serotonin
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.240]   offered the opportunity to increase neuroplasticity.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.760]   Right, so there's a different way of thinking about it.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.640]   And that's a segue for saying that,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.560]   when you say psychedelics, that's a broad category of drugs.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.200]   Nowadays, people even lump ketamine into that,
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   although technically it's not a psychedelic.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.560]   But the sort of classic, if you will, psychedelics
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.560]   are LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.400]   and psilocybin, aka mushrooms,
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.880]   although it comes in other sources as well.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.820]   The major effect of psilocybin
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.040]   is to stimulate a particular serotonin receptor,
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.200]   which has elevated density in particular brain areas.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.060]   And indeed, there are many recent clinical trials, many.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.060]   Let's just say 12 to 20 good-sized,
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.440]   clinical trials done in diverse locations on the planet,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.500]   many at Johns Hopkins and UCSF, some in Switzerland,
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.920]   showing that enhancing, and here you notice
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.220]   I'm using the mechanistic language,
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.760]   enhancing the transmission of, the release of serotonin,
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.140]   and activating particular serotonin receptors
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.120]   leads to an opportunity for more, what, neuroplasticity.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.300]   Now, I say it that way, not to add a bunch of word soup,
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.320]   but because the real question is whether or not
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.480]   the experience that one has
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.380]   while under the influence of psychedelics
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.380]   is critical to the clinical outcome.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.460]   Or a growing idea, just as a hypothesis
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.660]   I think is equally interesting,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.860]   is that it's the serotonin itself,
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.900]   and that the things you see, the things you hear,
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.840]   the things you experience are not relevant.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.700]   Now, I have some experience with psychedelics.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.560]   I had a bad time on psychedelics as a teenager.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.900]   I was also a pretty wayward youth,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.660]   but I've had a bad trip on LSD.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.660]   For years I was scared that people were gonna dose me
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.480]   with LSD after that, it was so bad.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.060]   I think across the board we can say kids doing psychedelics
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.220]   just seems like a bad idea.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.160]   Their brains are already hyperplastic.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.160]   If you have a predisposition to bipolar type issues
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.240]   or schizophrenia, it can exacerbate those issues.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.820]   And certainly, certainly, certainly,
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.280]   if you don't have adequate support
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.680]   in the form of somebody that can guide you
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.040]   through the sessions, as well as the pre-sessions
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.360]   which are not done with psychedelics,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.960]   as well as the so-called integration afterwards,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.120]   it can be a really slippery slope.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.840]   I know examples of people really suffering
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.640]   in the aftermath of psychedelic journeys.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.720]   Now, there are a few interesting points as well,
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.160]   and it wouldn't be fair if I didn't say that several,
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.640]   if not many, individuals who have had so-called
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.100]   treatment-resistant depression,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.320]   at least in these clinical trials,
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.200]   have reported feeling far better after psilocybin therapy,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.080]   but that psilocybin therapy was done
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.040]   with several pre-sessions, then the psychedelic sessions,
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.400]   then several after sessions,
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.560]   and it's not always the case that things turn out well.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.120]   So I think it's early days.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   What is interesting, and I think important,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.860]   is to recognize that psilocybin,
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.160]   and the structure of psilocybin,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.840]   is very similar to serotonin itself, very similar,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.560]   but it activates particular receptors.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.480]   A lot of people don't realize
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.120]   how similar to serotonin it is.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.720]   And that microdosing psilocybin,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.940]   I should say the data on microdosing psilocybin,
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.200]   something that's increasingly popular,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.060]   is not particularly compelling.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.900]   It's not clear what it does.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.780]   It's not clear if it's of any use.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.420]   And I think the danger here is that we end up
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.260]   in a situation as we did with, frankly, with cannabis.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.620]   And by the way, I'm not somebody who demonizes cannabis.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.040]   I think it has its uses for certain people,
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.260]   but very high THC concentration in cannabis
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.420]   can be a problem, especially with people
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.180]   that have a predisposition of psychosis.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.220]   And anyone that tells you that cannabis isn't addictive,
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.320]   just say, great, don't smoke weed for a week.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.380]   Let's see how you do.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.400]   Let's go on a plane trip together, all right?
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.900]   And how are you sleeping?
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.220]   And so I think the chronic cannabis users
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.480]   are starting to take note of some of the issues it causes.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.320]   But again, there are some clinical applications.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.120]   Now, when it comes to the high-speed trained psychedelics,
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.920]   like DMT, that's far less data available there.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.200]   And then MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.360]   for the treatment of PTSD,
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.400]   they're the data I think are more robust,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.360]   and I think we're likely to see legalization
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.240]   or at least decriminalization in the next few years,
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   but keep in mind that MDMA is methylenedioxymethamphetamine.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.720]   So for people that like dopaminergic states,
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.680]   it's a particularly compelling state to be in,
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.240]   so much so that they could overindulge in MDMA,
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.620]   and then there's the issues of purity,
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.280]   and I could do a five-hour podcast on this right now.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.360]   So I think the important point is approach with caution.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.080]   Kids, absolutely not.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.120]   And I think it's an exciting landscape, very exciting,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.440]   and whereas a discussion like the one we just had
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.900]   would have gotten me fired a few years ago.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.920]   I mean, Stanford has big programs now,
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.600]   a lot of philanthropy, federal grants,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.680]   and many laboratories focused on the study of psychedelics.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.840]   So I would say stay tuned,
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.140]   but keep in mind that increasing neuromodulator levels
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.080]   vary acutely, whether or not it's with a prescription drug
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.680]   or whether or not it's with psychedelics is really
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.000]   what lies at the heart of the recovery,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.560]   the potential recovery, I should say,
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.240]   or the negative effects that happen to occur
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.840]   in anyone that embarks on the psychedelic journey.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.520]   Do people who meditate need less sleep
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.400]   than people who don't?
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.900]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.320]   Well, we know that from a study by Wendy Suzuki,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.980]   who I believe, if NYU made the right choice,
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.880]   and I think they did, is now the dean of arts and sciences
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.360]   at NYU, she ran a memory lab for a long time.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.720]   She has data showing that even 10, I think it's 13,
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.780]   but as little as 10 minutes of meditation,
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.240]   supposed to be sitting still, breathing,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.800]   focusing on your breathing, directing one's attention
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.780]   to third eye center, et cetera.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.400]   We don't have a third eye.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.900]   The pineal is thought to be the third eye,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.960]   but I don't know why.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.060]   It's a light-sensitive tissue deep in the brain,
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.440]   but maybe that's why they call it the third eye,
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.200]   but in any case, that type of practice has been shown
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.320]   to increase memory focus, AKA learning,
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.720]   but there's some interesting footnotes in those papers
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   which point to the fact that when people meditate
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.960]   too close to bedtime, oftentimes they have trouble sleeping
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.280]   because basically meditation is a focusing exercise.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.000]   It's a perceptual exercise.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.920]   I don't think meditation is anything mystical.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.080]   It's a self-directed shift in your perception to what?
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.560]   To your interoception, to your internal state,
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.000]   as opposed to anything beyond the confines of your skin.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.960]   There's nothing mystical about that,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.880]   and then in that state, your brain starts to generate
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.960]   patterns of activity that are distinct from when you're
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.440]   sharing your attention between what's going on internally
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.240]   and what's happening out in the world, right?
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.960]   I think we need to demystify what people have cloaked
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.680]   as mystical, and when I say cloaked, I don't think that
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.400]   the people that meditate for thousands of years
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.960]   thought that there was anything mystical about it,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.260]   but sometimes what we experience there can feel mystical,
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.100]   so if you have trouble sleeping,
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.380]   I recommend doing some sort of non-sleep deep rest practice
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.500]   like NSDR, aka yoga nidra, although those are different.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.940]   NSDR generally lacks the intention piece,
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.840]   and the ones that I put in the world,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.120]   we've stripped away the intentions,
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.060]   and we've stripped away any kind of language
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.520]   that would make you think that there was some sort of,
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.920]   let's just say like cultural aspect to it,
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.040]   which again is admittedly a bit unfair
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.840]   to the origin practice of yoga nidra,
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.120]   but the problem again is that in yoga nidra,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.140]   you're gonna be doing intentions and hearing language
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.800]   that for some people, not all might divorce you
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.320]   from the wish to do it.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.400]   In any case, non-sleep deep rest done at any time of day,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.640]   but especially if you fall asleep in the middle of the night
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.560]   is going to be useful for helping you fall back asleep,
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.660]   whereas meditation again is going to enhance
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.520]   your level of focus, so I don't think it's a good practice
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.040]   if you have trouble sleeping.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.000]   Now, to finally answer your question,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.520]   if you meditate, can you afford to sleep less?
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.920]   My friend Matt Walker would say no.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.260]   However, many of us can't sleep as much as we want to,
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.900]   and many of us are not like Matt,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.360]   where we can wake up without an alarm clock.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.760]   Like, I'll just keep sleeping and sleeping,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.300]   unless I went to bed at like eight o'clock.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.440]   This is actually interesting.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.160]   There's an asymmetry to your sleep needs.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.560]   If you go to bed, remember that old adage,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.500]   you know, every hour before midnight is worth two after?
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.660]   Well, it turns out that for people
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.700]   that are meant to be early risers,
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.180]   going to bed at eight, you'll wake up
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.580]   at three or four feeling great.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.940]   You go to bed at 11, you feel groggy,
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.080]   and there are good reasons to explain that.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.500]   But Matt would say that you need your sleep, period.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.080]   I'm more of the camp based on my read of the data,
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.660]   and yes, we are allowed to disagree and still be friends.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.500]   It's allowed.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.840]   In fact, Matt's going to do a series on sleep
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.060]   with our podcast, even though he has a terrific podcast
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.580]   of his own, where we maybe debate a little bit of this,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.540]   that there are ways that you can at least replace
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.980]   the feeling of wakefulness that you would have lost
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.900]   if you don't sleep enough.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.960]   And for me, really, that's why NSDR
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.080]   became such an attractive tool to do
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.800]   for 10 or 30 minutes each morning
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.960]   if I didn't sleep enough the night before.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.500]   I first learned about yoga nidra,
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.280]   actually, at an addiction recovery center,
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.780]   trauma recovery center in Florida in 2017.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.180]   I have a friend, a super talented trauma therapist
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.340]   who also treats addiction that I've sent
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.140]   many, many people to, and he has this kind of
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.620]   seemingly wizard ability to get people
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.860]   who have been addicts to not be addicts.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.860]   And one of the tools he uses is yoga nidra every morning
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.220]   for 30 minutes and eventually an hour,
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.180]   which seems like a lot.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.820]   But then he also has these people wake up very early,
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.900]   maybe an hour before they would normally wake up
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.560]   and go into that liminal state
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.960]   between sleep and wakefulness.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.420]   Now, my experience is that 10 to 20 minutes
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.980]   of NSDR yoga nidra is sufficient to offset
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.940]   some sleep loss and allow at least me to function,
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.380]   and many people report the same.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.020]   We have a study going with the sleep laboratory
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.860]   at Stanford to explore this in more depth.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.620]   And what I can tell you, 'cause I'm involved
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.980]   in some of this work, is that there are several
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.480]   military units, because they have no opportunity
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.340]   to get sleep because they're working,
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.220]   that have to rely on tools like this
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.940]   in order to be able to function at their highest level.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.060]   And I'm sure they will tell you, as I will,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.980]   that they prefer to get eight to 10 hours of sleep,
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.140]   but guess what, they can't.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.800]   And so I think that's an important takeaway
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.540]   is that we don't get to pick how much we sleep,
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.260]   unless you're gonna be completely neurotic
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.500]   about your sleep hygiene, which makes you
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.440]   kind of a less interesting person in life,
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.380]   is what I'm told.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.500]   You know, going to bed at eight is great,
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.300]   like summer most of the time.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.320]   But you gotta stay up every once in a while.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.140]   I mean, after they released Chimp Empire on Netflix,
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.140]   I discovered that NSDR is a very valuable tool,
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   because, and by the way, Chimp Empire and Succession
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.340]   have a lot of parallels, and if you watch one,
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.060]   I sort of, I interleave, Chimp Empire Succession,
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.640]   Chimp Empire Succession, and you start to realize,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.500]   like, whoa, like, we're pretty similar.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.920]   And then you look at the world differently, I promise.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.100]   Your podcast has positively changed the lives
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.060]   of so many people, including me.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.540]   How has it changed your life?
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.980]   Okay, wasn't expecting that one.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.580]   Thank you, Samantha.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.500]   Well, first of all, I mean,
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.100]   as this little 11-year-old told me,
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.540]   I mean, this is essentially what I've done my whole life.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.100]   I'm a fairly private person.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.300]   Believe it or not, I'm pretty introverted.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.700]   I spend a lot of time alone.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.820]   And I think that's required for me to,
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.420]   you know, I basically have four modes, four modes.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.460]   One, I'm either readying myself through sleep
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:06.060]   and NSDR to do one of the other three modes.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.660]   Maybe there's a fifth mode.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.020]   Or I'm in one of these other three modes,
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.240]   which is I'm either foraging for information,
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.380]   organizing that information,
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.660]   or dispersing that information.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.380]   Or getting ready to do it all over again.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.480]   And then there's this relaxation vacation thing
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.900]   that they keep telling me about.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.400]   But then I went to Italy, and then, like,
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.580]   Rick and I just hung out there.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.000]   And it didn't feel like work.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.040]   I also discovered some really great podcasts.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.640]   I don't know, I think one of the coolest podcasts out there,
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.060]   if you like rock and roll, which I love,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.860]   is History of 500 Songs by Andrew Hickey's podcast
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.700]   on rock and roll.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.520]   I like the nerdy podcast.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.180]   It's like a graduate education in rock and roll.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.340]   It's so cool.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.040]   And you'll learn a lot about music and history
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.860]   and the mobs involved and all that stuff.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.540]   And from what I was told, Al Capone used to sit there.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.780]   His exit was there.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.100]   So it was weird, right?
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.660]   And he died of syphilis.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.420]   So I don't know how I feel about all that.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.720]   But they told me that.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:10.260]   So I think the podcast has been wonderful
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.660]   as an opportunity to share things that I love.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.900]   If I had my way, it would be more like this,
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.340]   although more of a dialogue, frankly.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   It's changed my understanding of what the world is like.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:29.360]   I certainly get critique, and that's good.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.220]   But again, I was raised by an iconoclast,
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.840]   in particular my postdoc advisor, Ben Barros,
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.740]   who unfortunately, as I mentioned, is dead
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.940]   'cause I worked for him.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:43.420]   But he really encouraged all of us in his lab,
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.680]   and often we were very close friends.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.760]   I spent the last year of his life recording
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.600]   an interview with him.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.880]   There's actually a documentary coming out about Ben.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.120]   And then I'm gonna release the audio interviews with Ben,
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.700]   which he approved, by the way.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.300]   And you'll get to realize that the history of what you see
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.580]   is often not what the dead person really did or said.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.460]   It's gonna be fun.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.220]   So I can't wait 'til they release this documentary,
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.240]   and then Ben gets to have his voice infused in.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.700]   And it'll be a cool documentary, but as some of you know,
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.860]   that what appears to be and what was
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.820]   in the historical narrative is not necessarily
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.460]   what really happened, but that's just life.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.180]   So I suppose the short answer is that I feel very honored
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.420]   with the opportunity, very, very honored.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:32.320]   And it's a challenge at times.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.100]   I suppose that the major challenges are when things
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.900]   are taken out of context, like little clips
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.940]   and things of that sort.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.940]   Being misunderstood doesn't feel good, but look,
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.740]   at the end of the day, I feel like the luckiest person
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.500]   in the world because I get to spend my time learning.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.320]   So it's either I'm foraging, I'm organizing,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.380]   or I'm dispersing information that I also want
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.820]   and that I find incredibly useful, or if not that,
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.260]   then certainly informative and at times enchanting as well.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.100]   So I try and focus on the positive,
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.480]   and I have a number of practices that help me do that.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.040]   And I am somebody who engages on social media.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.940]   I'm not a post and ghost kind of person.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.020]   I want to understand.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.340]   I think that cuttlefish are super interesting,
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.340]   but human beings are super interesting too.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.060]   And I have a strong drive for mastery,
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.620]   but also I do have a strong sense of justice,
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.780]   and that can be problematic at times.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.700]   I define justice as feeling like there's something
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.120]   for us to do about something.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.500]   Like seeing something that upsets us or that excites us
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.840]   is great, but then if you have a strong sense of justice,
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.860]   you feel like there's something you need to do about it,
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.420]   and not everybody feels that.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.780]   And then of course, a desire to understand.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.500]   And I think for reasons very personal to me
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.220]   that relate mostly to just having a kind of
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.820]   incredible array of experiences in life,
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.660]   many of which were shocking, disturbing,
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.580]   exciting, enchanting, that I want to understand.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.580]   And so it's changed things, but it's like,
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.560]   I don't know, I got one truck, one watch.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.300]   I, you know, it's not to say that I don't care
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.880]   about having things, there are a few things I really love,
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.960]   but mostly I'm just thinking about the podcast
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.600]   we got to record on Monday, which is about willpower
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.280]   and tenacity, and if I don't stop myself,
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.540]   I'll give it right now.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.180]   So what do you feel is the next big thing
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.300]   to come to the forefront in the health space?
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.620]   Thanks for this question.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:32.540]   One is non-protein amino acids.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.240]   I love these debates online because I know
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.740]   that there's something there.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.800]   It's so cool, 'cause I grew up in seeing these debates,
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.680]   and you know there's something interesting there,
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.700]   because people are debating about it,
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.660]   but the debate isn't what's interesting.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.660]   It's almost always the thing that people aren't talking
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.420]   about that's sure to surface at some point,
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.460]   and you know right now there's this obsession
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.100]   with like seed oils, it's like seed oils, seed oils,
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.660]   and I can't demonize seed oils.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.780]   All the data say that if you separate out
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.260]   their caloric load, there's nothing inherently bad
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.920]   about seed oils, and et cetera.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.820]   I don't know, it's still in emerging literature,
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:09.820]   but there was a scientist at Stanford, Ed Rubenstein,
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.600]   who passed away at a ripe old age,
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.340]   a brilliant scientist who talked about,
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.840]   and I had a lot of discussions with when I was a postdoc
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.280]   about non-protein amino acids.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.040]   Turns out his son is a neuroscientist at UCSF.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.880]   His other son's a physician at UCSF,
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.480]   so he's another one of these low-performing families,
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:35.640]   and all wonderful people, and you know,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.680]   Ed had data that, you know, unlike a lot of animals
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.640]   like birds, there are certain amino acids
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.620]   which are non-protein amino acids that exist
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.260]   in fairly high density in seeds and nuts,
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.220]   which is not to say that seeds and nuts are bad, right?
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.100]   I had almonds this evening, okay, so please.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:01.140]   But non-protein amino acids are similar enough
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:06.140]   to mammalian protein amino acids
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.940]   that if they are consumed in abundance,
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.560]   and perhaps especially in liquid form,
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.520]   that they may, again, may, 'cause this is about the future,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.540]   this isn't about what we know, this is about where I think
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.640]   there's an interest and growing interest,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   they may be able to incorporate into certain proteins
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.780]   of our tissues of our body that potentially,
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.320]   Ed thought, could lead to misfolding of those proteins,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.000]   and may explain certain forms of neurodegeneration
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.280]   and other neurocognitive challenges.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.020]   So I think non-protein amino acids
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.900]   are going to be an important discussion.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.220]   Now there are lots of non-protein amino acids
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.800]   that are not, that don't come from foods,
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.220]   but I think the discussion around non-protein amino acids
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.520]   from foods is going to be very interesting.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.240]   So that's one area.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.200]   The other area, and perhaps you picked up on this
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.560]   a little bit tonight, is that I like the nuts and bolts-y
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.160]   stuff around stress, neuroplasticity,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.860]   but the high-level stuff, you know, I think,
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.740]   you know, the relationship between, you know,
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.020]   structured thought, abstract thought,
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.420]   I'm not interested in the free will discussion,
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.380]   I just feel like that's a career ender.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:15.380]   I'm friends with Robert Sapolsky, and he's got a great book
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.540]   coming out about this, called Determined,
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.220]   so he obviously doesn't believe in free will,
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.520]   but he's far smarter than I ever could be,
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.140]   and it just feels like, I don't know that there's
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.020]   an end point with that one, but if anyone could find it,
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.180]   it would be Robert, he's oh so smart.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.380]   But I think that the higher-level stuff,
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.780]   creativity, abstract reasoning and thought,
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.580]   defining and better understanding the different states
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.940]   that we can go into in waking, and I confess,
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.360]   without a hint of sheepishness about it,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.900]   that I also think the notion of spirituality
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.900]   and the belief in things that are beyond our current
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.860]   and conscious understanding is super interesting.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.220]   I think that, you know, as a species,
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:10.400]   we've been challenged and conflicted from go,
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.460]   at least that's what the historical scripture tells us,
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.700]   and that it's sort of inherent to our experience
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.740]   that life is challenging and perplexing,
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.300]   and also wonderful, and so I think a better understanding
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.400]   of how to navigate all that, I mean this like,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.680]   this stuff in our skulls, except for the eyes,
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.580]   which by the way are two pieces of brain
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.020]   that are not in your skull, the retinas,
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.260]   I have to point that out.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.420]   You know, it's tricky, and we're trying to use
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.220]   that very tissue to understand it,
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.540]   and so I'm intrigued by the possibility
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.220]   that there are certain aspects of self
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   that maybe are not intended to be explored,
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.980]   because they are not really of us, right?
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.860]   Brains interacting with one another is an interesting area,
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.440]   certainly for scientific exploration,
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.120]   but I'm fascinated by and excited about the possibility
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.180]   that at some point, our species will both understand
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.260]   the mechanics of our emotions,
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.640]   mechanics of our thought process, creativity, and so on,
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.560]   but that we will also allow room for the stuff
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.300]   that we can't explain with science,
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.260]   and to allow room for that in our life experience,
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.820]   because I also believe that can be powerful,
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.380]   and while understanding things in great detail
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.320]   and putting mechanism and utility around that
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   and applying that is wonderful,
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   it's the stuff of my life, which is obvious,
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.860]   I also think that there's great value
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.200]   in not trying to control and understand everything
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.800]   and enjoying the mystery of things
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.500]   that are clearly greater than us.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:57.260]   (audience applauding)
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:02.780]   How do you balance having fun
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.920]   with having such a rich knowledge and passion
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.340]   in neuroscience and optimization?
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.180]   Fun.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:11.580]   People ask me, like, what do you do for fun?
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.140]   I think people think I do all the protocols.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.920]   It's like, sure, I get my sunlight, I drink my water.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.960]   I do them, but fun.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:30.420]   I like learning, I do enjoy physical movement.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.980]   I like learning.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.420]   For me, it's the little things, I don't know.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.860]   Maybe I'm weird, certainly, I've been told that.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.900]   Like the other day, there was a frog in my swimming pool,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.740]   and he was just like sitting there like,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.900]   and I just like spent some time looking at him,
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.360]   back and forth, and then I had all sorts of ideas
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.340]   about like, what's he doing, and what's he thinking,
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.040]   and then I was thinking how Oliver Sacks used to spend time
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.360]   imagining experiencing life as a bat
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.700]   through only echolocation.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.360]   He talked about this, and I thought,
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.040]   and why would he do that, right?
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.020]   And that's kind of cute.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.200]   He's like a delightful old man, right?
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.980]   He had a 600-pound free weight squat,
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.760]   won the State of California squatting championship,
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.620]   but also like pretending he was a bat.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.460]   He's a weird dude.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.380]   Did methamphetamines, raced motorcycles,
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.140]   you know, like hung out with movie stars,
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.460]   but then also was like a recluse and liked rocks.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.100]   Okay, that's a weird scientist.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.080]   Been around a lot of those.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.420]   But, you know, in discussions with people that knew him,
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.900]   I mean, that exercise of, and like seeing something
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.660]   he thought was cool, like a bat,
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.540]   you know, allowed him to also use theory of mind
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.860]   to kind of think, well, what would it be like
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.260]   to have locked-in syndrome and only be able to
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.400]   like blink your eyes to communicate?
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.160]   And gave him an incredible compassion and sensitivity
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.240]   for other people that then he transmuted
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.680]   into the form of like these wonderful books.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.880]   So for me, fun is really about doing the things
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.760]   that I do systematically each day,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.320]   but then when something excites me, I know that feeling.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.440]   I know it physically in my body,
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.320]   and to just follow that trail, like a weirdo, right?
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.520]   Like a weirdo, just like Barris was a weird
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.600]   and Barbara Chapman was weird.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.720]   And like, I think everybody's a little weird
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.800]   if you allow yourself to just see the things
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.080]   that you think are really cool.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.060]   And there are a bunch of things that I think are really cool
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.400]   that enchant me that a bunch of other people love too.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.700]   And I know that 'cause like I see,
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.360]   we're all watching that video or something like that.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.520]   But I think for me, fun is in the practice
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.800]   of trying to stay open to like the little things.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.640]   The little things that kids say are always delightful
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.360]   'cause they're not filtering through all the bullshit
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.360]   that we filter our life experience through.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.420]   But also just, yeah, I like reading and learning, exercising.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.140]   I mean, I like to think I'm not a very wooden person,
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:59.040]   but at the same time, I mean, I didn't see the Barbie movie.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.300]   No disrespect to Barbie, you know, I go to movies.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.320]   I do that kind of thing.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.680]   I don't know what else is there to do at some point,
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.800]   you know, what else is there to do?
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.640]   Anyway, I mean, I delight in certain things
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.320]   as you now know far too much about,
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.060]   but fun is a relative term.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.600]   That was a hard question.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:27.840]   (audience applauding)
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.660]   Thank you.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.080]   Thanks for the pass.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.200]   - Thanks, man.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.800]   - Do you believe time changes due to daylight savings time
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.240]   is worth a potential loss of productivity?
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.480]   Daylight saving times is anti-health.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.720]   Okay, this is where I'll get like, it's just dumb.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.880]   It's just dumb.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.960]   It's just so dumb.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:45.880]   It makes no sense.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.640]   I mean, the director of the chronobiology unit
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.800]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.320]   my good friend, longtime friend and brilliant scientist,
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.380]   Samara Hattar will tell you, it's a stupid idea.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.740]   It's anti-biology and increased car crashes,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.760]   increased heart attacks, increased depression.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.520]   It's just, it's like, kids don't like to wake up early.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.080]   Anyway, parents don't like to wake up early,
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.000]   especially with kids that don't like to wake up early.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.200]   It makes no sense.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.040]   And then there's all these arguments about, you know,
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.600]   is it really about trying to truncate the late,
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.440]   you know, you want more light in the evening
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.320]   so there's less crime?
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.160]   Like, that's totally unsubstantiated.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.480]   Like, it's completely unsubstantiated.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.280]   So the daylight savings thing is just stupid.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.360]   Basically, try and get as much light in your eyes,
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.440]   ideally, from sunlight early in the day.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.120]   And by the way, if you're worried about cataract,
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.080]   that's a serious concern.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.720]   After all, I have an appointment in ophthalmology.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.120]   You know, cataract, macular degeneration, but guess what?
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.600]   The chair of ophthalmology from Stanford
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.640]   when he came on the podcast verified this.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.560]   When the sun is low in the sky,
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.680]   you're not really at risk of that, right?
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.240]   So when the sun is overhead and you're like,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   you're beaming your eyes, like trying to get,
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.680]   yeah, it's a problem.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.040]   But we're talking about viewing low solar angle sunlight
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.400]   in the morning and in the evening.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.000]   And if there's clouds, do it anyway.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:56.840]   In fact, do it longer.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.880]   And if you can't do that,
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.440]   look at some artificial light inside.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.440]   Daylight savings is just, it's just stupid.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.080]   You know, you know.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.160]   What happens here is as the night goes on,
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.200]   the amount of GABA in my brain starts to diminish
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.720]   and then I just kind of go to short form.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.680]   We've thought about podcasting in the middle of the night.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.160]   That's why when I went on Lex's podcast recently,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.920]   the more recent one, he did it at eight o'clock at night
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.960]   and he cried.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.920]   He made me cry.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.760]   He didn't cry.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.920]   He made me cry.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.660]   I was so tired and then I can't think.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.040]   And then he asked me about my dog
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   and I'm talking about the dog.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.700]   So, you know, his goal was to get me to cry.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.920]   We have this friendship, you know.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.040]   No, he's delightful.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.280]   What should I as a 19-year-old college student
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.620]   be doing to maximize the years of neuroplasticity
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.460]   I have left?
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.320]   I get this question.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.680]   I'm like, oh man, such a great question.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.860]   Reese, well, I'm assuming, yeah.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.680]   I don't know who you are, Reese, or what you're doing.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.960]   But you're 19, so the cool thing is
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.160]   your brain is hyperplastic.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.360]   Life is a psychedelic experience without psychedelics.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.080]   Gosh, people always say, like,
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.300]   if you could go back to your 19-year-old self,
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.140]   what would you do?
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.040]   And that's a tricky one.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.840]   There are movies about that, right?
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   But, you know, I would definitely worry less.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.560]   Yeah, I would worry less.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.300]   I would have more fun.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:19.400]   I would certainly, listen, I started latching on
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.280]   to practices and the understanding of science as a way.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.840]   For me, it was kind of like, my world felt very unstable.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.500]   And for me, it brought stability.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.880]   But you want to avoid rigidity.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.540]   So, you know, do you want to be the one 19-year-old
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.520]   who's like, oh, I got to get to sleep.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.480]   You know, I got to go back to bed at 8.30 at night.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.960]   Now, yeah, enjoy life.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   But I would say, when you're 19, learn how you learn.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.780]   Learn how to focus, learn how to rest.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.240]   Basically, you can stress and focus as much as you want,
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.760]   as long as you can still fall asleep at night
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   and sleep well, and fall back asleep if you wake up.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.960]   You know, we hear stress is bad, stress is good.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.940]   Stress is bad, stress is good.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.840]   Stress is bad, unless you're getting enough sleep,
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.140]   in which case, stress is called learning in life.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.600]   Now, obviously, don't do anything dangerous.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.480]   Avoid psychological and physical danger.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.020]   But I think as a 19-year-old, I mean,
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.340]   my direct advice would be,
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.900]   have some cardiovascular activity you like,
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.760]   have some resistance training activity you like.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.000]   Develop some sort of self-awareness practice,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.160]   like journaling, could be meditation.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.800]   Surround yourself with people that you like,
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.820]   avoid people you don't like.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.340]   I mean, it sounds so straightforward,
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.140]   but then we can all look into our personal histories,
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.500]   and be like, well, I spent all this time
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.140]   trying to resolve this thing that, clearly,
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.960]   you didn't like them, it's simple.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:40.980]   Like, you didn't like them.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.820]   They weren't into cuttlefish or ferrets.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.660]   You didn't like them.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.980]   Wasn't your kind of person, right?
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.360]   And that's not a box you can check on the dating apps,
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.340]   they tell me, right?
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.480]   The ferret thing, I think it'd be a very,
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.140]   very small subset of people.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:57.040]   I think, you know, the know thyself thing is huge.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.900]   Learn to tap into that early feeling
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.680]   of like, this feels right, this doesn't feel right.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.940]   Learn to be a bit of a rudder for yourself.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:09.460]   And journal, I still have stacks of things
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.560]   that I wrote across the years, most of it is terrible.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.240]   But you will find, if you go back,
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.720]   that you kinda knew better all along,
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.940]   even if you didn't do better all along.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:24.800]   That voice in your head, don't do that, do that.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.660]   This person's like, everyone else is crazy
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:28.780]   about this person, but not me.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.380]   But this is like, you know,
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.620]   I don't wanna sound sentimental,
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.360]   but you have to find your heart, right?
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.980]   Or at least not lose it.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.340]   You have to make sure that you're in touch
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.540]   with that piece of yourself that wasn't judging
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.740]   and just felt good.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.700]   And as long as it's not something that's self-destructive,
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.100]   I think that's the most important thing.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.460]   And then, yeah, have tools and practices in place
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.280]   because they work.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.140]   And when you're 19 and your neuroplasticity
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.820]   is through the roof, you can do a lot less
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.340]   and get a lot more.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.780]   But don't worry about hitting 25 and it all being over.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.580]   Certainly, that's not the case.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.900]   But you can cram in a lot early on.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.780]   I still regret not learning an instrument.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.400]   The data on people that learn an instrument
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.660]   even later in life, but certainly at 19,
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.460]   is that it greatly increases your ability
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.360]   to learn all sorts of things.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.920]   So learn an instrument.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.200]   How can we transform the American education system
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.620]   to be more effective?
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.460]   Oh.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.060]   So in 10 seconds,
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.860]   So when I'm in charge, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.960]   A little while back, I did an interview
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.820]   with a major media outlet and they were very gracious.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.440]   And then they said, like, what's next?
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.260]   And I was like, I'm gonna run for office.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.040]   I was just like, you know, I was sort of,
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.220]   look, it's not out of the question,
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.580]   but frankly, I think that I'm so poorly suited for that.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.260]   It's obvious.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.900]   I'm so poorly suited for that.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.500]   So it wasn't a joke, but it was, you know,
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.020]   I think as I spent some time afterwards,
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.620]   like, oh, I should really go talk to people
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.820]   who do that for a living.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:02.860]   But I am very interested in potentially informing policy.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:06.220]   If I were to ever be asked, I'd certainly respond.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.500]   And my stance on this is, you know,
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.180]   much in the same vein as the podcast,
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.300]   because keep in mind the podcast,
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.280]   yes, Lex suggested I start one,
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.860]   but it was really during those days
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:22.580]   of the deep 2020, 2021 pandemic where,
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.880]   by the way, I wasn't allowed to talk about vaccines,
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.720]   so I didn't.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.180]   And also I don't have any expertise in it,
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.960]   so I was not well suited to do it.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.660]   But I also decided it's a topic
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.860]   that enough people are talking about.
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.180]   So my response in life and in general,
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.100]   when people say, what about something?
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.260]   Is I like, well, I've got a lot of opinions about that,
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.120]   but this isn't the venue, okay.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.200]   But during the pandemic,
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.820]   I realized there was a lot of circadian disruption,
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.320]   anxiety, stress, a bunch of things happening
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.480]   with visual systems and biological systems
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.440]   that I felt there were tools
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.600]   that people could perhaps benefit from.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.520]   So I just started putting that information into the world,
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.740]   and I was really surprised, really surprised,
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.560]   that people that I knew from the neuroscience community,
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:07.340]   for instance, at NIMH or, you know,
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.660]   in government positions weren't talking about this stuff,
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.940]   so I just kept doing it.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:18.000]   And I think that it made clear to me
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.820]   that the education system is not one thing.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.860]   It's tough, especially when talking about kids,
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:27.740]   like what to do is a tricky thing,
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.700]   but that the education system, in my mind,
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.860]   should at least involve some sort of discussion early on
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.120]   about this thing called the brain,
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.420]   this thing called the body, how they work,
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.020]   how you can do certain things
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.980]   to modulate your stress level, your sleep,
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.460]   the importance of, not just the importance of sleep
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.140]   and nutrition and avoiding social isolation
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.300]   and all these important things,
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.360]   but giving people some levers and knobs
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.260]   to maneuver within themselves,
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.500]   and zero-cost tools as a way to do that
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.380]   that transcend socioeconomic boundaries,
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.380]   ideally transcend language as well,
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.460]   because we're not just talking about the United States,
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.820]   and of course, within the United States,
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.420]   there are many different cultures
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.380]   speaking different languages,
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.940]   and maybe AI will soon allow us to put out the podcast
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.980]   into a bunch of different languages, I think it will.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.300]   So I think that the education system should start,
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.840]   in my opinion, with teaching kids
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.780]   how to understand themselves,
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.340]   what to do in difficult scenarios
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.820]   that's really anchored in the real pillars
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.220]   of biology and psychology,
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.700]   and try to take some of the mystery out of
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.820]   trying to navigate the tough business of growing up.
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.980]   I mean, if you think it's tough being an adult,
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.860]   which it can be, certainly, it's really tough growing up,
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.980]   as we all know, and I think that more tools,
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.100]   more tools, more protocols, more tools,
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.220]   more tools, more protocols, more tools.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.060]   But that's obviously a biased opinion,
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.940]   and no one's ever asked me, like,
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.900]   "Hey, what should we be teaching kids?"
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.580]   But if they ask, you can tell,
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.500]   like, I'm not gonna shut up, so.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.180]   I think that was our last question.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.800]   Thank you all for coming tonight.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.640]   I want to--
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.140]   Forgive me for going long.
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.920]   I do want to say thank you, sincere thank you,
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.520]   for making your way out here,
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.860]   especially on a weekday night.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.140]   Thanks for your hospitality.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.240]   My incredible team, I want to thank them,
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.200]   and certainly, last but not least,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.220]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.040]   Thank you.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:31.880]   Thank you so much.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.040]   (audience applauding)
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.800]   (upbeat music)
