[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   My name is Faith Burke.
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.340]   I'm a wife, homemaker, and homeschooling mom of four kids, eight and under, three boys
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.820]   and a girl.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.320]   We live in the Texas countryside just outside Fort Worth.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.020]   I have been a Desiring God ministry partner for over 14 years.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.220]   You're listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.300]   Faith has been a ministry partner of ours for 14 years, back to her days in college.
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.300]   It's amazing.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.180]   I want you to hear her story in just a moment.
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.300]   But first onto today's question about the divided heart.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.860]   The heart, even the heart of a believer, puts up resistance against God.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.060]   It's frustrating, but it's not unusual.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.500]   And it leads to a great question from an anonymous listener today, a man.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.460]   Dear Pastor John, hello, in the episode titled "Why is my delight in God so short-lived?"
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.860]   That was APJ 903.
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.900]   There you suggested one way to make our delight in God last longer.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.620]   You said, "When you read your Bible every day, pause before you read in earnestly, with
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.420]   as much heartfelt longing as you can muster.
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.540]   Pray to God that he would come and meet you in the reading of Scripture and open the eyes
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.140]   of your heart and show you what is really there and make himself real and bring about
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.980]   amazing changes in your life."
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.340]   However, Pastor John, when I muster a longing that God would come and meet me, I find my
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.780]   heart is unwilling to welcome God.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.760]   It seems afraid of meeting God.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.320]   It doesn't want to be with God.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.020]   And this upsets me.
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.780]   On one hand, I want myself to be willing to meet God sincerely and enjoy the sweet time
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.200]   with him.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620]   On the other hand, my heart opposes that.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.180]   Such chaos inside.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.020]   What can I do when I find my heart is resisting?
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.220]   So let me repeat the key issue as I hear it.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.640]   He says, "When I muster a longing," that's a significant phrase, "When I muster a longing
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.140]   that God would come and meet me, I find my heart unwilling to welcome God.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.060]   Seems afraid of meeting God.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.700]   It does not want to be with God.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.380]   What can I do when I find my heart resisting?"
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.820]   So this is clearly a divided heart.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.740]   It's not a heart entirely welcoming, and it's not a heart entirely resisting, because he
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.660]   says, "I muster a longing.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.380]   I muster a longing for God.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.300]   Muster a longing."
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.020]   And he says, "When I do, I find my heart unwilling to welcome God."
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.620]   So this heart is in some measure a longing heart for God and in some measure a resistant
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.620]   heart to God.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.100]   Now that's important for him and for us to see, because if we don't see this division
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.180]   in the heart, that it's a divided heart, we might overstate the problem and think there's
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.900]   no real root of desire for God in me.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.420]   Or we might understate the problem and think that our resistance is no big deal.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.420]   It can't be that.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.100]   I can't be resisting God.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.260]   And it seems to me that this embattled heart is typical of the Christian life, even if
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.020]   we don't all describe it the way he does with the language of longing and resisting.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:53.100]   None of us as Christians has a consistently united heart in longing for God.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:01.500]   I have often tried to help others in their prayer lives by sharing what helps me, namely
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.780]   the acronym IOUS.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.360]   And I would commend this to our friend with a focus on the letter U, I O U S, which in
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.900]   my opening of this acronym doesn't usually get a lot of focus.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.840]   I'm usually focusing on the S, the O, or the I.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.800]   But this man needs the U, it seems to me.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.860]   So the letter, let me just work through it real quick.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.940]   The letter I stands for incline.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.860]   Psalm 119.36, "Incline my heart to your testimonies, we pray."
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.260]   So we ask God to take away resistance.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.420]   We ask God to incline us toward God and his Word instead of away from God.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.220]   And so we admit this is a work of God.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.780]   He would not be praying, the psalmist would not be praying like this if the inclination
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.580]   was finally in our own power.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.820]   He wouldn't be asking God to incline his heart.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:10.660]   We plead with God to take our hearts in his hands and incline them, bend them toward his
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.660]   Word.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.580]   Then the letter O stands for open.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.140]   I O open, Psalm 119.18, "Open my eyes that I may behold wonderful things out of your
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.220]   instruction."
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.340]   We need God to do the miracle on the eyes of our heart so that we can see the truth
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.340]   and beauty and value of who he is right there in his Word.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.100]   If we are left to ourselves, we admit by praying, if we are left to ourselves in meditating
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.700]   on God's Word, we will see nothing of spiritual beauty and worth.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.860]   And then comes the third letter, U, which in this case is going to be especially important.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.340]   It stands for unite.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.820]   Psalm 8611, "Unite my heart to fear your name."
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.100]   What an amazing prayer.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.780]   Unite my heart.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:16.180]   So what's the problem that this psalmist is praying to solve?
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.420]   The problem is a divided heart, and that's what we're dealing with here in this question
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.740]   on APJ.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.760]   This man has a longing for God and he has a resistance to God.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.940]   His heart is divided.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.420]   It needs to be united in its longing for God.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:46.560]   So I would say to our friend, recognize that you have a divided heart and plead in prayer
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.660]   Psalm 8611, "Oh God, unite my heart to fear your name."
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:01.820]   And of course, fear, fear your name doesn't mean feel a resistance to God's coming because
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.180]   you're afraid of him.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.820]   Just the opposite.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.860]   Fear of running from him.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.900]   What we fear when we fear God is we fear resisting him.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.260]   We fear pushing him away.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:22.140]   We fear the horrible outcome of hardening our hearts against the sweetness of his fellowship.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:29.820]   God's chosen people who embrace Christ as their treasured savior are the apple of his
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.940]   eye.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.900]   They are his loved ones.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:41.260]   Or as the psalmist says, the friendship of the Lord is for those who, surprisingly, fear
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.260]   him.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.740]   Do you hear the connection between Psalm 8611 and Psalm 2514?
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.580]   Unite my heart to fear your name and the friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.460]   The fear of God does not drive us away from God.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:05.540]   The fear of God drives us into God where there are the pleasures of friendship.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:11.940]   So pray Psalm 8611, "Unite my heart to fear your name," and then preach to yourself Psalm
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:21.980]   2514, the friendship, the sweet private counsels of the Lord are precisely for those whose
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.740]   hearts are united to fear God's name.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:31.740]   Then preach to yourself the promise of the new covenant in Jeremiah 32, 39, where God
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:40.460]   says, "I will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me forever for their
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.860]   own good, that may fear me."
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.140]   I will give them a single united heart that they may fear me forever.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:56.020]   So now we have not only the prayer that our hearts would be united in the fear of God
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.300]   rather than resistance to God, and not only do we have the promise that friendship, the
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:08.220]   friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him, now we have, Jeremiah 32, a new covenant.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:14.700]   That means a blood-bought, Jesus blood-bought promise that God himself takes out the heart
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.700]   of stone and gives a united single heart.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.560]   I will give them a heart to fear me.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.460]   So when you find this division in your heart and a resistance begins to rise up, pushing
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:38.140]   out the welcome and the longing, declare to yourself, preach to yourself and to your sin
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.300]   and to Satan, "No, no!"
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.460]   You might even say it out loud.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.300]   I talk out loud sometimes to my sin and to Satan.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.700]   This resistance is not the new covenant work of Jesus that he bought for me.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.700]   No, it's not.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.820]   The new covenant work that he bought with his blood is a single new united heart that
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.460]   fears God, welcomes God, enjoys the friendship of God.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:10.100]   It is united in its love for God, and you throw, you throw the truth of the blood-bought
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.500]   new covenant promise in the face of the deceiver, and then you meditate.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:23.140]   Perhaps on James 1.8 and James 4.8, "A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways."
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.940]   Purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.340]   And you read that and you call down all the purifying power, purifying.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.880]   Purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.420]   You call down the purifying power of the blood of Jesus.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:45.080]   Christ died that we might have a single heart for him.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.860]   So don't give up.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.780]   I'm saying this now to our friend.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.780]   Don't give up.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.540]   Don't surrender to a divided heart.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.660]   Resist the resistance of God.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:02.660]   Call out to God for a single heart and fix your mind on the promises.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.520]   Friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.420]   He will give a single united heart to his blood-bought people.
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:20.620]   And the "S," the lonely "S" at the end of our acronym, I-O-U-S, will come to pass.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:27.700]   Psalm 90, 14, "Satisfy me in the morning with your steadfast love."
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.700]   So good.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.900]   It's an important way to address the divided heart.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.660]   Well, you met Faith at the top of the episode.
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.100]   Faith is a wife, a homemaker, and a homeschooling mom of four kids, eight and under, three boys
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.100]   and a girl.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.020]   They all live just outside of Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.740]   Faith has been a Desiring God ministry partner with us for over 14 years now, dating back
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.260]   to when she was a student in college.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.260]   It's amazing.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.180]   I want you to meet Faith now.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.420]   She's on the phone with me from her home.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.220]   Faith, thank you for taking a moment from your very busy days at home to talk with us.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.260]   I've heard you say in the past that Desiring God Resources, and John Piper's ministry in
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.300]   particular, built your backbone of faith back in your 20s.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.020]   Share that story with us here on the podcast.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.020]   Yes.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.420]   So I was on a mission trip in Italy with YWAM when I read my first John Piper book, The
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.340]   Dangerous Duty of Delight.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.620]   And so, you know, like many 20 year olds back then, I was drawn to this radical, solid,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.260]   biblical, loving God with your mind approach to my faith.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.980]   So then back home in Texas, I started to attend conferences where Pastor John was speaking
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.860]   and I started listening to Desiring God CDs and reading articles from the Desiring God
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.860]   website.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.700]   I was hungry for answers to life's tough questions.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.180]   Desiring God and John Piper built the backbone of my faith in my 20s, and I'm so grateful.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.580]   So then I got married in 2012.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.300]   I suffered six difficult pregnancies over the next seven years.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.460]   I was hospitalized, I was losing weight.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.420]   I had hyperemesis gravidarum.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.900]   We lost two babies.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.620]   And yet God remains faithful and Desiring God continued to be a guiding light.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.620]   From the beginning, John Piper would tackle these hard questions and he didn't skirt around
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.620]   them.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.220]   He didn't give easy, feel good, fun sermons.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.260]   He really challenged us in our 20s and he gave us something more to live for.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.980]   He convinced us that truly God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in Him.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.500]   And he promoted this, you know, radical lifestyle changes, like going on a mission trip to an
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.220]   unreached people group, you know, and why are we asking the question, is it safe?
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.340]   He just really challenged us to not waste our life.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.580]   And that just really struck a chord with me.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:48.460]   And so just his unshakable faith in God, his confidence in God's sovereignty, the consistency
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:53.060]   in his message and his life, he just really modeled the kind of Christian that I wanted
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.060]   to be.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.220]   You now homeschool four kiddos, so your days are very full and busy.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.540]   And this podcast and Desiring God Resource is coming to play in your parenting too.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.540]   Explain how that works.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.820]   So, you know, I never realized in all the reading and learning from Desiring God that
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:14.420]   I did in my single years, how that would prove to be such a resource in mothering.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:19.340]   For example, like tough questions that my kids ask me about God and how life works.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.940]   They ask me all the time, these kind of questions.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:27.820]   And for example, after one of my tough miscarriages, my little son, Ozzy, I think he was four or
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.580]   five at the time, asked, "But mommy, why did the baby die?"
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.580]   Trying to wrap their little minds around these hard life situations.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.860]   And I was able to draw from what I'd read and learned from Desiring God about God and
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.860]   about his sovereignty and just give them solid little kid answers like, "You know, honey,
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.460]   mommy doesn't know why, but we do know that God's good and God had a purpose for this
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.340]   little baby, even if he only lived in my tummy."
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:58.500]   And so it's just a, it's a big responsibility shaping these little, you know, biblical life
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.500]   perspectives.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.800]   And I'm just so thankful for these resources.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.760]   One of the things I love about Desiring God is the accessibility.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.020]   If anything happens, like some sort of tragedy, just at my fingertips, I can pick up my phone
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:18.460]   and go to the website and enter in a question or look up a verse or search for a hard topic.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:25.720]   And these articles pop up that I know are biblically solid, they're solid articles,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.260]   and I can find answers and encouragement also for myself and then to encourage other people
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.260]   with.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.260]   Sobering.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.260]   Sobering.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.260]   Wow.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.760]   I mean, it's just so great to have those that you know and love.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.640]   I mean, it encourages us beyond what you can imagine to know that our resources are accessible
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.760]   for you to find them and then to use them as you serve others.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.040]   That is just awesome, Faith.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.280]   Thank you.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.880]   You're talking right now to a bunch of listeners to the podcast, many of whom have never given
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.000]   in the past.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.060]   What would you say to them in this opportunity for them to join you as a partner with Desiring
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.060]   God?
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.400]   Yeah, so I would just say pray about it.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.180]   You know, pray about how God has used Desiring God in your life.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.260]   And I would say that even small amounts matter.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.040]   I gave back when I was a poor single student, you know, eating ramen for dinner.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.380]   I didn't have a lot of money, but I was so impacted by the ministry.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.660]   I wanted to give back.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:24.060]   And then after I got married with my husband, we just prayed about it and wanted to give
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.900]   together.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.860]   And I was just so thankful for what Desiring God is doing.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.780]   So thankful for the help and the encouragement that they're offering people and all of it
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.780]   for free.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.700]   I mean, it's unbelievable the amount of resources that are on the site for free.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.100]   And I just wanted to be part of that.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.300]   You know, the staff at Desiring God has become like a family to us.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.220]   They walked with us through those miscarriages.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.500]   They prayed for us.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.940]   And it's just it's just been such an honor and a blessing to be a partner with them.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.680]   Partner for 14 years back to your college years, Faith, you have made a huge investment
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.680]   in us.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   I thank you.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.020]   It's been delightful to hear your story today.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.020]   Thank you.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.020]   We love you guys.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.020]   You can see why I love talking with our ministry partners.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.060]   It's always so encouraging.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.380]   As we near the end of the year, it's a great reminder that we have generous friends all
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.980]   over Texas and all over the US and all over the world, really, who support this ministry,
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.700]   friends who have profited from Desiring God personally and then who have become partners
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.380]   with us to get behind the resources that we produce, to get them out and to make them
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.380]   free.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.560]   And if those resources have impacted you through our articles, our books, our sermons, videos,
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.820]   this podcast, that's because someone has donated to make those resources available free of
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.720]   charge to you.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.480]   And now you can make it possible for others to access them as well all over the world
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.000]   free of charge.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.600]   To do so, become a monthly ministry partner.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.700]   So much of our financial support comes from folks who give on average $30 a month.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.680]   To set up monthly giving, go online to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.480]   That's give.desiringgod.org.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.400]   It is greatly appreciated.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.280]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke and Pastor John and I return on Monday, diving back into that
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.960]   hotly debated text of Romans 9.22.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   See you then.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   Have a great weekend.
