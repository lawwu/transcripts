[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Good Friday, everyone.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.040]   On this podcast, we regularly take questions about how the early church did things, and
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.320]   then we ask what practices we read about in our Bibles are directly transferable to our
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.960]   local churches today.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.840]   And within that category, I think would fit today's email from a listener named Robbie
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.840]   in Kentucky.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.280]   "Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.200]   In 1 Timothy 2a, we read that Paul exhorted men to pray in church while lifting up holy
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.320]   hands.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.960]   What's the connection between lifted hands and holiness?
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.240]   And what about lifted hands and prayer?
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.120]   Is this practice culturally dated or is it a relevant one we should adopt today in our
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.320]   corporate church gatherings?"
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:03.000]   The text, namely 1 Timothy 2a, says, "I desire then that in every place the men," and the
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.440]   word is men, not just persons, it's males, "should pray, lifting holy hands, without
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.760]   anger or quarreling."
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.160]   And then Paul continues, interestingly, in verse 9, without a break, and shifts from
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.640]   men to women and says, "Likewise, I desire that in every place the men," and the word
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.640]   is men, "should pray, lifting holy hands, without anger or quarreling."
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.160]   And then Paul continues, "Likewise, also that women should adorn themselves in respectable
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.680]   apparel with modesty and self-control."
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.800]   And I think it's relevant for understanding the word to men to realize that it's paired
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.920]   with a word to women.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.600]   It's relevant because it relates to the question whether Paul is addressing merely a peculiar
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.000]   problem at Ephesus or whether he's speaking more generally in a way that all of us should
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.400]   sit up and take notice, even in the 21st century, because it relates to our situation as well,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   male and female.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.320]   Now, we might be tempted to think that Paul is focused here mainly on the situation at
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.900]   Ephesus because when he says that anger and quarreling should be put away, that triggers
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.040]   in our minds another text in 1 Timothy, namely chapter 6, verse 4, where he says there's
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.320]   a group of people in the church who have an unhealthy craving for controversy and for
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.000]   quarrels about words which produce dissension.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.480]   So we might think, well, that's why here in 1 Timothy 2.8 men are told to pray without
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880]   anger and without quarreling.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   It's a peculiar problem at Ephesus.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.080]   And that may be why Paul put the emphasis here on anger and quarreling, but I don't
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:05.120]   think he means for us to hear his words as limited to the application for Ephesus.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:15.160]   And I say that mainly because he says, "I desire that in every place men should pray,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.480]   lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling."
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.520]   So the words "in every place" show that he's giving general instructions to men,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.440]   and that carries over to the instructions to women as well.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   In every place, women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel with modesty.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   So it seems to me that Paul is putting his finger here on a typical male temptation and
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.400]   a typical female temptation.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:00.080]   In general, men are more given to the temptation of angry, verbal jousting and outbursts of
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.000]   combative quarreling.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.200]   And in general, women are more inclined than men to give attention to their appearance
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.840]   when they go out in public.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.040]   Now, of course, those are generalizations, and there are exceptions for both of them,
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.960]   but Paul seems to be putting his finger on a problem that is more peculiar to men and
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.320]   a problem that's more peculiar to women.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.680]   He's addressing them both in general, not just because of a peculiar problem at Ephesus.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.660]   And our question here is about what he says to men as they gather to pray.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:49.140]   And what he says is that he wants men in every place to pray, lifting holy hands without
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.080]   anger and quarreling.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.560]   And the question is, is Paul saying that in all our praying we should be lifting our
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   hands?
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.680]   I think that's the basic question that I'm being asked.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.280]   And I think the first thing to say is, because we've seen it already, that the emphasis
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.960]   does not fall on the lifting of hands but on holiness and the renunciation of anger
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.200]   and quarreling.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.320]   It's significant that when he says he wants men to lift holy hands, that he goes on to
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.640]   underline the holiness, not the hands, namely, get rid of anger, get rid of quarreling as
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.880]   you come to pray.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.320]   That's where the emphasis falls.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.520]   It's as if the lifting of hands is a given.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   It's just a given.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.500]   That's what you do in worship.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.880]   And so what he's telling them is not so much to do what they always do, namely, lift
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   your hands.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.020]   He's saying, lift holy hands, lift pure hands.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.760]   Do it with peace and without quarreling.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.480]   Now all of us from time to time speak this way.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:07.200]   A teacher in grammar school might say to her students, "Now, young people, I want you
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.040]   to always come to class asking questions respectfully."
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.600]   Or a coach might say, "I want us to get out on the field and throw completed passes."
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:27.280]   Now, those are not statements about how often the student should ask questions or how often
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.960]   the quarterback should throw passes.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.960]   Those are statements about do it respectfully and do it completing passes.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.880]   That's the way I think Paul is speaking here.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.280]   The command is not to always lift your hands.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.200]   Be sure to always lift your hands.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.720]   It's lift them with holiness.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.280]   Be free from anger and quarreling.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.800]   But let me add two other questions.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:05.520]   First, why did Paul take for granted that it was so common in worship that men should
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.800]   lift their hands?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.920]   He was just assuming it.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:17.440]   And surely part of the answer is that the Old Testament refers to this practice often.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.880]   Nehemiah 8.6, "Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people answered, 'Amen,
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.920]   lifting up their hands.'"
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   Or Psalm 28.2, "Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cry to you for help, when
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.680]   I lift up my hands."
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.040]   Psalm 63.4, "I will bless you as long as I live.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.440]   In your name I will lift up my hands."
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:51.200]   Psalm 141.2, "Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting of my
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.040]   hands as the evening sacrifice."
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:03.720]   So probably Paul simply assumed it because that's the way the church is worshipped following
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.960]   the tradition of the Psalms.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   It seems natural.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.720]   I think that's why it happens in the Psalms, and that's why it happens today.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.180]   It seems natural.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:20.960]   If the heart is exulting before God over some great reality of grace, it seems natural that
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.200]   the body would join the Spirit in the exultation.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.400]   I mean, why wouldn't it?
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.560]   We are body and we are soul, and we exult in this glorious reality.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.200]   And here's my last question.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.160]   Why wouldn't we lift our hands today?
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.560]   I'm arguing that it's not a command here, but that we lift our hands in holiness when
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.880]   we lift our hands.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.280]   But I'm asking this question, why wouldn't we lift our hands in worship?
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.800]   And of course the answers are many, right?
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.560]   It's not the way I was raised.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.240]   It's not my personality.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.120]   It's not my culture or my ethnicity.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.520]   It's not the way our church worships.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.000]   It would be misunderstood as identifying with a group whose theology is defective.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.520]   I remember talking with a leader in another country, and I said, "I spoke at one group
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.000]   in this city, and everybody was raising their hands.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.880]   I spoke in your group with 5,000 people, and not a hand was raised.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880]   What's that about?"
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.200]   And he just sat flat out, because if we did it, we'd be aligned with the people with a
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.480]   defective theology.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   Or it would be phony.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.960]   I don't want to just be carried along by my emotions, etc., etc.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:46.800]   So there are a lot of reasons why people don't do what the psalmist says is natural to do.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:55.080]   So I would just end with the question, given Paul's assumption that it was so common in
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:03.200]   the early church, and given the Old Testament exhortations and examples, and given the natural
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:11.960]   union between body and spirit in true exaltation, is the reason that you don't lift your hands
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   a good reason?
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.440]   Good challenge, considering the cultural hurdles that are at play here.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.960]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:28.680]   Ask a question of your own, or search our huge archive at AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.920]   We break for the weekend now and return next week to ask another question about authentic
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.360]   living.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:41.840]   Can a true Christian be saved if they never evangelize, never once shared the gospel with
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.520]   an unbeliever, and don't really intend to either?
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   Can such a person be saved?
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.760]   Wow, that's a big question.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will ask Pastor John on Monday.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.040]   See you then.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   [END]
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   1. What is the definition of "true Christian"?
