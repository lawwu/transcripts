[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.160]   So we'll start, as always, with some questions about deep work.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.700]   We did a pretty long opening segment,
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.160]   so I am going to be pithy.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.560]   Of course, I've said that before.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.760]   We'll see if that actually works out.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.840]   All right, our first question comes from Clarissa.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.920]   Clarissa says, I'm writing my dissertation,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.720]   and I am struggling.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.320]   As a clinician by trait, I struggle
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.840]   with this phase in my PhD program.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.120]   I'm somewhat traumatized by my advisor, who
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.400]   criticized my ability to write two years ago.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.560]   I always received excellent grades during coursework,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.880]   but now in dissertation phase, she
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.640]   is beginning to compliment me, but I'm still insecure.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.720]   I've hired an editor and a communication coach.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.840]   I buy all the books on how to write a dissertation,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.040]   but I still struggle with the writing process.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.320]   Well, Clarissa, what I'm going to do first
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.840]   is de-emphasize the writing aspect of you putting together
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.960]   your dissertation.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.400]   This is a-- it's a complaint I've often
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.080]   had about the rhetoric around dissertations
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.920]   that I used to voice a lot when I was early in my professor
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.600]   career, because I had a background in productivity
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.080]   advice.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.400]   I was asked to come to a lot of what are known as dissertation
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.800]   boot camps, where you get together
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.040]   a bunch of grad students at a school who are working
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.000]   on their dissertations.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.240]   They all work together to try to get progress,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.040]   and they bring in speakers.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.000]   And I spoke at a lot of these.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.800]   And this was the point I often made.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.320]   Stop making writing the only verb
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.440]   you use to describe working on a dissertation.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.280]   Stop making the whole focus on, did I get my pages in?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.320]   How often am I writing?
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.360]   How many hours of writing am I doing?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.680]   Because when it comes to academic work of this type,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.440]   80% of the effort is thinking, figuring out
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.720]   what you want to say and making it something worth saying.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200]   Now, what this actually means depends on the field.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.520]   I mean, if you're in a more humanities-based field,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.080]   you're doing philosophy or something,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.560]   this really might be the framework
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.760]   you're trying to put together.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   If this is more of a clinical research-based dissertation,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.320]   which sounds like might be your case,
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.360]   figuring out what to say is actually doing experiments,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.020]   looking at what you discovered, coming up
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.240]   with better experiments, understanding the literature,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.280]   figuring out the thing you want to say is 80% of the work
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.160]   and where almost all of the value comes from.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.740]   20% is just getting that down in a way
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.000]   that people can understand.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.200]   The writing is a small part.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.320]   I'm saying that, Clarissa, because I
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.960]   want you to feel better.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.600]   You are not trying to get a Pulitzer for a book of fiction
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.080]   you're writing.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.640]   You are not trying to pitch The New Yorker
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.760]   to do some long-form piece where what's really
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.000]   going to matter is the craft and the poetry of your writing.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.040]   No, what you're trying to do is take lots of deep thinking
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.620]   on something that's new and important
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.780]   and just express it in a way that people can understand.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.000]   You need to be clear and you need
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.360]   to be grammatically correct.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.920]   You need your writing to not get in the way of what you're
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.840]   really trying to do, which is deliver the idea.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160]   So clear writing, well-constructed,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.600]   simple sentences, good grammar, great.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.520]   Everything else goes into actually figuring out
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.120]   what you want to say.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.440]   So look, you hired an editor.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   That's fine.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.560]   They can help you with the clarity.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.520]   And that's all you need to worry about.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.320]   Have them look at a couple of chapters, and they can, hey,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.160]   you're using word repetition, and be
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.480]   careful with your commas, great.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.180]   They'll help you with that.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.620]   Your writing will be clear.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.500]   That problem is solved, and I don't want you
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   to worry about that anymore.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.620]   Again, you're not Joan Didion.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.060]   You're not thinking, can I create poetry
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.020]   with my sentence rhythm?
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.860]   So don't worry so much about the writing.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.900]   On the other hand, be very systematic
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.500]   when you think about, what do I want to write about?
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.620]   Experiments, reading the literature,
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.140]   working over what you want to say, checking that with people.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.060]   Does this make sense?
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.140]   Do you buy this argument?
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.940]   Let me just give you this argument in words.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.980]   Do you buy this argument?
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.780]   Workshopping your ideas.
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.420]   Be much more relentless on thinking
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.700]   about what you're going to say.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.800]   And once that's right, again, the writing,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.100]   when it comes to dissertation, is just,
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.620]   can I get this information from my head
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.780]   to your head without roadblocks wronged away?
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.560]   And Clarissa, I think you already can do that.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.140]   And the editor will give you a little bit of extra confidence,
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.500]   but you're there with that.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
