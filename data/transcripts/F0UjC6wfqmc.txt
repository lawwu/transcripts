[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620]   - So one interesting philosophical point
[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.160]   that quantum mechanics bring up
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.440]   is that you talk about the distinction
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.300]   between the world as it is and the world as we observe it.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.160]   So staying at the human level for a second,
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520]   how big is the gap between what our perception system
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.080]   allows us to see and the world as it is outside
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.120]   our mind's eye, sort of?
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.000]   Sort of not at the quantum mechanical level,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.520]   but as just these particular tools we have,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.200]   which is the few senses and cognitive abilities
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.980]   to process those senses.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.000]   - Well, that last phrase,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.920]   having the cognitive abilities to process them
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.440]   carries a lot, right?
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.080]   I mean, there is our sort of intuitive understanding
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.440]   of the world.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.540]   You don't need to teach people about gravity
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.260]   for them to know that apples fall from trees, right?
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.380]   That's something that we figure out pretty quickly.
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.320]   Object permanence, things like that.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.960]   The three dimensionality of space,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.680]   even if we don't have the mathematical language to say that,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.760]   we kind of know that it's true.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.600]   On the other hand, no one opens their eyes and sees atoms,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.200]   right, or molecules, or cells for that matter.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.720]   Forget about quantum mechanics.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.800]   But we got there, we got to understanding
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.400]   that there are atoms and cells using the combination
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.760]   of our senses and our cognitive capacities.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.200]   So adding the ability of our cognitive capacities
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.760]   to our senses is adding an enormous amount.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.400]   And I don't think it is a hard and fast boundary.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.560]   You know, if you believe in cells,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.160]   if you believe that we understand those,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.640]   then there's no reason you believe
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.600]   we can't believe in quantum mechanics just as well.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
