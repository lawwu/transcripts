[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   My friend is telling me that the volcano seems to be starting to erupt.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   If that volcano goes off, we have nowhere to go.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   That got my attention.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.240]   So if you say scared, I would say that I got the realization that what that meant.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.480]   I went cold for like a fraction of a second, but that meant that just my adrenaline started
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480]   to kick in.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.000]   And it was a very, very strange experience because now you have tunnel vision.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It's about survival.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.960]   The following is a conversation with Natalie Cabral, an astrobiologist and scientist at
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.880]   the SETI Institute, directing the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.480]   She explores some of the harshest places on earth, including free diving and volcanic
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.520]   lakes, all in the pursuit of understanding living organisms beyond earth.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.320]   For this, she holds the woman's world record for diving at an altitude, both scuba and
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.200]   free diving.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.840]   She's amazing.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.320]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.240]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.560]   And now, dear friends, here's Natalie Cabral.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.080]   You are the director of the Carl Sagan Center for Research at the SETI Institute.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.720]   SETI of course stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.560]   One of the things you do as part of that is travel to some of earth's most extreme and
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.240]   dangerous environments in search of organisms that live in conditions analogous to those
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   on Mars.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   First, let me ask what the job posting for the work you do looks like.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.360]   Is it like Shackleton's ad in 1900 that said people wanted for hazardous journey to the
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.360]   South Pole?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.080]   Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.720]   And also, where do I apply?
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.440]   That's funny because there was not really a job application.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.880]   In fact, when you're a scientist, you have questions in your mind and you have hypotheses
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.680]   and you start to list the kind of thing you need to answer.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.340]   And then when you see the kind of thing you have to answer, then you kind of know the
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.040]   places where you need to go to do that.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   As far as science is concerned, I started with analyzing data from the Mars missions.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.280]   And I had written a PhD about water on Mars, first looking at channels and the history
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   evolution of water.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.480]   But then during my postdoc, I started to look where that water was ponding.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.400]   Interestingly enough, everybody was about channels and water and whether catastrophic
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.000]   or wetland or seepage.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   But when you are talking about ponding water like lakes or ocean, people started waving
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.460]   their arms a little bit.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.320]   So it was a little bit of a battle, interestingly enough.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.880]   But that got us on track with my husband.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.660]   We were working together and we started developing the idea, the concept of lakes in impact craters.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.240]   So why an impact crater?
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.380]   Because the Viking mission at the time, which is what we were working with, the resolution
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.440]   and the topography were so poor that there was really no way of telling where you had
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.600]   a real low in the topography.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.280]   The only thing you knew was a hole in the ground was an impact crater.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   So when you saw valleys...
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   What was the Viking mission?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.200]   The Viking mission landed on Mars in 1976 and there were two landers and two orbiters.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   So they were really our first feet on the ground on Mars, but they were lander.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   They were not moving.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   They were not going up.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.080]   And that was the data you were looking at?
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.660]   It was already in the 90s, but we didn't have yet the Mars Global Surveyor and whatnot.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.460]   We still work for 20 years.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.460]   We worked on that.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.560]   I did my master and my PhD thesis on Viking missions.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.200]   You mentioned that the places you go to are defined by the questions you want to ask.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.320]   Let's just step back.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.000]   What questions have always tugged at your heart?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.840]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.040]   That's why I was looking at those images and saw some lakes.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.600]   And then came time where we started talking about sending landers and rovers on Mars and
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.120]   looking maybe at the possibility that Mars was habitable.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.280]   And lakes are particularly good places to look for those questions.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.080]   So this is how it all ties up.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.640]   So you were always curious about life out there?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.100]   I have been always curious about life in the universe and about questions on how we got
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.800]   to be here and the bigger question.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.900]   Now with 25 years more in that business, it's more about understanding the origin and nature
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.720]   of life rather than whether there is life or not on Mars.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.120]   This was really for me a stepping stone to bigger questions, but they were definitely
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.160]   important because they helped me frame my way of thinking about those questions.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.240]   And so looking at Mars, at lakes, understanding what the conditions were 3.5 billion years
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.880]   ago or close to 4 billion years ago, then I knew the type of environment I needed to
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.200]   explore here on Earth as analogous to be able to understand what type of life still survives
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   in those environment and what kind of instrument and what kind of resolution do I need to actually
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.680]   detect it.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.360]   So this is how the whole thing started.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.200]   And it started with a small grant, literally 40K.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.000]   It was a discretionary fund.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.920]   And this is how I got started in my career.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.960]   And so many of these questions you can answer by looking at life in extreme conditions here
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   on Earth.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.520]   - Let's step back a little bit and look at Mars and lakes on Mars.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.440]   Just going back to your PhD and before, and maybe today, what do we understand about life
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   on Mars?
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.600]   What do we understand about lakes on Mars?
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   Is there water on Mars?
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.440]   What do we understand about the conditions from 4 billion years ago on Mars?
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.480]   - Well, we've gone a long way.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.760]   Remember from the Viking where we had no resolution.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.240]   Well, we'll had a little bit more resolution than with Mariner.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240]   - What did you think at that time?
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   Sorry to interrupt.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.000]   Just take us back to that mindset.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.680]   - It was really the exploration, like your first look at a planet.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.360]   You have to remember that the first mission that successfully snapped some pictures of
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.240]   Mars was Mariner 4.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.360]   And then everybody at that time was still under the spell of, you know, H. Wells and
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:47.800]   the idea that Mars looked with telescope so similar to the Earth.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.040]   Polar caps, we could see them with a telescope and we knew it had season.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.560]   The actual tilt is pretty much the same as the one for Earth.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.720]   So when Mariner 4 left, everybody, not everybody, but a lot of people thought that we would
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.520]   see the crystal cities and domes and stuff, that another civilization might have evolved
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.080]   in parallel to us in the solar system.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.880]   And of course, when the first images came back and Mars looked with that kind of resolution,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.600]   it had like the moon, it was a huge disappointment.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.960]   Then Mariner 9 came and that changed everything.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.080]   There was a little bit of drama because Mars started one of the biggest dust storm it ever
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.080]   experienced.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:41.400]   And so for three months, we had an orbiter circling around Mars and not seeing anything.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.680]   But then when the dust cleared, all of a sudden we started discovering volcanoes, valleys,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   ancient channels, dune fields, polar caps, and see what I'm talking to you, I don't
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.900]   need to invent any words to describe Mars.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:08.640]   And although the myth of extraterrestrial civilization on Mars was gone, all of a sudden
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.360]   the imagination of the scientists started to pick up because right away we're seeing
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.960]   something that was familiar that we could describe.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:23.360]   So right away, Viking would put on the fast track and the idea was so Mars looks so much
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.840]   like Earth could have been, although it's arid and there is little atmosphere, et cetera,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.000]   could there be life?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.720]   And of course, behind this, at the time, there were people like Klein and Sagan, Carl Sagan,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:46.960]   just thinking about how can we test the idea of biology of life on Mars?
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.020]   So this is what Viking did.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:56.200]   But of course, at the time when the two landers arrived on Mars, we didn't have the context
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.920]   of the geology of the environment.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.180]   We didn't have much data at all.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.680]   So the data that Viking sent back was very confusing.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.920]   Some people still think today that we discovered life on Mars at the time, because some of
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.680]   the experiment turned out to show a strange signal.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   But most of the community think that it can be explained by chemical reaction that we
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.060]   see today.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.920]   So it was so confusing that NASA decided to say, okay, if we want to be serious about
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.880]   looking for life on Mars, we have to understand the environment because life and environment
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.580]   co-evolve.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.560]   So as cause or effect, a planet is going to give you the physical chemical environment
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.400]   for life to happen.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.640]   These are the boundaries.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.120]   But once life is here, it's going to change everything.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:53.000]   One of the biggest impact of life was to inject oxygen into the atmosphere of the Earth two
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.960]   billion years ago.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.560]   And that changed everything, including our signature in space.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.200]   So there is this co-evolution.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.600]   So if you want to understand one, you have to remove the other from the equation.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.960]   It's kind of a two or none equation.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.680]   So even though oxygen changes our signature today, what if all life on Earth died and
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.480]   now we fast forward a billion years, what would be the traces left?
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.340]   So the question I'm trying to ask is, if life had existed on Mars, what would be the signs
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.520]   we would look for?
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.700]   That's a very good question.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:36.080]   The thing is that if you draw the parallel with Earth, it took 82% of Earth's history,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.040]   geological history, to go from very simple life, microbial life, to complexity.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.380]   And when I'm saying complexity, I'm not even talking about us, I'm talking about animals.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:54.440]   So Mars is smaller, lost its magnetic field very fast, and lost its atmosphere very fast.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.100]   Life also appeared on Earth very fast.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.160]   So the condition being quite similar at that time between the Earth and Mars, let's assume
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.480]   for a moment that life appeared on Mars.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.160]   It would have been simple life when conditions started to degrade, which was less than a
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.680]   billion years after the planet had formed.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:21.800]   So everything at the surface would have disappeared, except maybe for morphological traces of the
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.560]   interaction between life and its environment.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.760]   So on Earth, the best example are what we call stromatolites.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.320]   These are rock formations that are built by microbes.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.080]   So we know that, we know how to recognize them.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.200]   You could have chemical traces as well.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.560]   There is some interesting question marks right now about carbon isotopes at Gale Crater,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:52.480]   because we found an abundance of C12, which normally is used by life on Earth, but it
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.560]   can be produced by other things.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.080]   So it's not that it's a real biosignature in itself, but it's intriguing.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.400]   We have now the C12 and we have methane.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.480]   But going back, it's a time on Mars 3.5 billion years ago, where you have lots of destructions,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.640]   where you have lots of impact cratering, etc.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.120]   But we still have very old rocks that survive from that time.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.160]   So these are good places.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.720]   That's why we're sending the rovers in those places, ancient lakes and impact craters,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.040]   and places where you have very old rocks.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.200]   So when you say ancient lakes and impact craters, the simple question, so impact crater is a
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.280]   crater created by a giant rock hitting the planet?
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:42.600]   And yes, a big rock that can be metal or rock, or it can be a comet as well, mostly ice.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.640]   So is that good for life or bad for life?
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.960]   For creating life and destroying life?
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   Both.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.600]   It's actually both.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.120]   Interestingly enough, the building blocks of life, the bricks, the stuff we are made
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:04.200]   of, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, they were included on our planet.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.320]   They were built in just because our planet is made of these kinds of rocks, asteroids
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.400]   and comets coming together by what we call accretion.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.040]   So they were built in.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.640]   When an asteroid comes, there is a lot of destruction going on.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:27.160]   But at the same time, those rocks, they bring with them those bricks of life, and they create
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.240]   lots of energy.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:36.600]   And if the environment around is favorable, you might possibly have some seeding going
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   on.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.160]   That's one of the aspects of what we call panspermia, which is the fact that comets
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.840]   and asteroids have the building blocks of life embedded in them, and that given favorable
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.120]   conditions, they might be able to seed planets.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.460]   This is a theory.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:58.000]   What percent of you, when you're looking up at the stars and wondering about this stuff,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.840]   thinks that panspermia is what happened on Mars or on Earth, which is the building blocks
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.560]   of life came from elsewhere?
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.280]   Well, but, you know, that's the thing.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.800]   Panspermia is a vector, potential vector, which means that it actually distributes the
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.160]   stuff of life left and right, but it doesn't explain the origin of life.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.400]   It's not the environment itself.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.280]   It just promotes maybe, and we still have to prove this.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.200]   And what we know is that the stuff we are made of is very abundant all over the place,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.120]   including in interstellar medium.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.640]   So it's all over.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.640]   It's all over.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:43.200]   The idea is that maybe it just waits to have the proper environment, and we know what it
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.400]   needs here on Earth.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.680]   It needs water, it needs energy, shelter, and nutrients.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:57.320]   So you're fundamentally interested in the origin of life and the big leaps in evolutionary
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:05.240]   history that could be like an origin of something, origin of eukaryotes, origin of photosynthesis,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.000]   origin of whatever.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.760]   I just think if we're a civilization here on Earth and we survive another few hundred
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:17.240]   years, I think it would be a good idea to take a big gun and just shoot life out there,
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.040]   like a life gun.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.520]   Basically try to create panspermia.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.560]   That's a good backup solution.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.680]   So one way is to actually copy our brains and actual humans, some complex information,
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.200]   and send it out there.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.100]   Another way to preserve life is just to send the basic building blocks.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.360]   Send a bunch of bacteria, a bunch of whatever the rugged organisms are on Earth.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360]   Just send a bunch of those.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.840]   - These are not the building blocks.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.200]   They are actual organism.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.960]   - Right, but isn't that a nice shortcut?
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   Do we want to...
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.560]   Because you said building blocks are everywhere.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:57.720]   - Yeah, the bricks of life, the carbon, hydrogen, et cetera, they were produced by the death
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.120]   of previous stars.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.600]   So this is how they were produced.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.200]   Stars like our sun started to form 10 billion years ago.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:13.480]   That doesn't mean that the sun is the only kind of star that produce life or enables
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.760]   life, but actually was produced 10 billion years ago.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.280]   Now what you're talking about is a little different.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:31.280]   Right now there are many, many efforts to do the type of thing you are talking about,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:38.200]   which is to put our DNA on whatever kind of substrate and preserve it in vaults, either
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.720]   in different place on Earth or on the moon.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.680]   Some people are already thinking about putting DNA on the moon.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:54.160]   As far as brains concerned, it's drawing towards transhumanism, which is the enhancement of
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.320]   who we are through AI and machine learning.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.040]   Of course, having backups is a good thing.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.720]   For me, I would say that taking care of our planets and going back to a place where we
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:12.360]   are in equilibrium with our environment would be also maybe the best backup possible.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.960]   And let evolution do its things.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.680]   Right now we are like teenagers with enough brain to create cool tools, but we don't have
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.160]   enough brain to understand yet the consequences of what we are doing.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.440]   And right now we are paying for this.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:37.200]   So the question is whether we are going to be able to move forward and learn from the
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.920]   mistakes we are making to become a mature civilization.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.800]   You probably heard of the Drake equation, that would be the L at the very end, the duration.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.920]   The duration of intelligent civilization.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   Exactly.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:59.440]   Or at least the length of time a civilization remains detectable.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.280]   It can disappear from the radar screen literally for a number of reasons.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:11.440]   The first one is destroyed itself or being destroyed by external events.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.520]   Or it can become so in tune with the universe and so advanced that it disappears because
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.040]   it melts really in the background and it's not visible anymore.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:29.560]   There are some wild theories out there saying that civilization might be so advanced that
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:34.160]   you cannot distinguish them from physical processes.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.680]   And that was an example.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.480]   It doesn't say that this is the case, but some people say, imagine that in fact all
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:46.280]   the dark matter that we see or we theorized about is in fact some sort of a biological
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.040]   process.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.640]   So you can think about a number of things.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:59.040]   Personally, I believe that what you talk about, about preserving our information, is kind
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.760]   of what life does.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:09.280]   We need to look at ourselves as not different of what the little self that started off was.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.320]   And this is what tells you not about the origin of life, but in fact the nature of life, which
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.240]   is a lot more interesting to me.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   It is.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.760]   The nature of life is really what is going to give you some universal signature to look
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.440]   for it all over the place.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.220]   And not only around ponds of water for life as we know it.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:36.620]   But the nature of life is telling you that life wants to get the most information possible
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.240]   around its surroundings.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:46.040]   And complexity is in fact the ability to gather and exchange and preserve the most information
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.000]   possible.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.440]   And so what you're saying is kind of preserving the kind of information we have.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:03.280]   So in the things that we are doing, as life happened, and I say happened because we don't
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.760]   know what life is, we have 123 definitions of life and some people are saying we don't
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.800]   have any definition, we only have descriptions of life.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.960]   And that's true.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   And that's true.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.080]   So think about it for two minutes.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.000]   We are looking for something we don't know it is.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.160]   But we have a few clues about the nature of life.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.460]   There are some really good theories.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.520]   The first one was Schrodinger, right?
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.640]   In the 40s.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.400]   Right now there is a guy named Jeremy England.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.920]   It's another biophysical theory of life.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:40.120]   It says life is the inevitable result of thermophysics.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.960]   This is the best way to beat entropy, to fight entropy.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:49.840]   But when you look at what we are doing, if you want to know what the nature of life is,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   look at our languages.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.080]   And they can be very different languages, but they all have the same purpose, right?
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.040]   Exchange information, understand, you know, store information, and also whether it is
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:07.480]   with somebody at the outside or thoughts in yourself.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.880]   That's the same thing the cell was doing.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:16.520]   But now when you're looking at life and at the structure of our languages, life started
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.640]   with an atom.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   So it's an atom.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.720]   They got together to create inorganic molecules.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.840]   Then you have complex inorganic molecules.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:33.200]   Then you get to organic molecules, complex inorganic molecules, and then you have RNA,
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.700]   DNA, etc.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.920]   Look at the structure of our language.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.800]   We created alphabets, letters.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.420]   That's your atom.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.200]   Then we put them together to create syllables, right?
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.240]   The syllables get together to create words.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.160]   Words tell you something, but they are nothing without a verb that gives the direction.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.000]   That's RNA and DNA.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.680]   And then you can put all the complements you want.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.160]   Our languages are built exactly as life is built.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.240]   We are repeating patterns.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.800]   I call this the Mandelbrot universe and the fractal universe because this is exactly what
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.360]   it is.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   I would say that as much as I do believe to sending probes to explore the universe, I
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:26.520]   say we should also look inward to find the answer to some of the profound questions of
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.320]   who we are, what's life, what's the nature of life, because we are expressing life.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.920]   So searching not for life, but for the nature of life.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.400]   The nature of life, absolutely.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.040]   I am more interested in that because the day we understand the nature of life, then we
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.720]   have a universal biosignature.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:53.640]   And it doesn't matter whether this life responds to the same kind of biochemical processes
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.960]   as we do, although it makes sense.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.600]   I told you about the generational aspect of the bricks of life, the stuff we are made
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   of.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.040]   The sun is part of the youngest generation of stars.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.640]   And the first two generations of stars didn't produce the kind of elements we are made of.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:20.600]   They were stars that were either without metal, just made of helium and hydrogen, or poor
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.560]   in metals.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:31.120]   So the stars died off and stars like the sun were born from those.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:38.580]   And this is why we have elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc. now.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.600]   And that's the life we are built on.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:46.040]   So I think it's not stupid to be looking for something that looks like us, because right
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.200]   now in the universe, this is the stuff that's the most abundant.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.840]   And we see with the exoplanets, with Kepler, with TESS, and now with James Webb, we see
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.680]   that there are many, many different types of planets that may be habitable in the habitable
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.240]   zone of their stars.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.100]   There are countless stars like the sun.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:10.440]   But more interestingly enough, there are other types of stars where you do have habitable
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:16.840]   zones as well, and where the duration of the stars is sometimes a thousand times more than
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.980]   our sun.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.600]   So you can imagine all sorts of things.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.240]   And you can imagine what type of life would be around those stars.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.340]   The biochemistry might be quite similar, in fact, and especially for the simple life,
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.280]   because simple life starts really quickly on Earth.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.320]   So my take on this is that the universe is full of cyanobacteria, but as far as intelligent
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.560]   life, it takes more time.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.000]   So that can take different aspects.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.560]   LR: So you think it's possible that the universe is full of bacteria, and even those stars
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:04.680]   that last a thousand times longer than the sun, even on the planets that orbit those
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:13.440]   stars, maybe it's bacteria, for billions and billions and billions of years?
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.880]   HA: We actually don't know what triggered the evolution to complexity on Earth.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.080]   That's still a big question mark.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.320]   LR: Is that the most impressive invention on Earth to you?
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:29.440]   HA: That Cambrian revolution is really what took us towards what we are.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.080]   And in the meantime, there were the dinosaurs, etc.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.360]   The dinosaurs were wiped out, so the evolution could have taken a completely different turn.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.200]   It's always, I would say, mass extinction that are going to drive what's the end game.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:52.600]   But yeah, you take two planets and you change those asteroid impacts, all those big geological
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.280]   events that wipe out like 90% of life at any time.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.960]   The thing that seems to be interesting, there are two things.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   The first one is where you are located on our galaxy matters a lot.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.680]   We actually are in the habitable zone of our galaxy.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.440]   And if you are too close to the center, then it's a lot denser.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.440]   And remember, we have the Oort cloud around our solar system.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.480]   And if you are in the region of the galaxy that's too populated, then you're going to
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.120]   run gravitational interaction with all these stars.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.840]   And since it's more dense, you will have more of the comets that are living in the Oort
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:48.160]   cloud being ejected from the Oort cloud and coming towards the inner solar system and
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.720]   collide with planets.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:54.520]   So you will have more of these impacts if you are too close to the center of the galaxy,
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.080]   not to mention the radiation.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   There is a place in our galaxy where it's a really bad neighborhood.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.220]   You don't want to be there.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.400]   You wouldn't be able to have life.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:13.880]   But what really matters is extinctions, but also the climate history of a planet has a
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.520]   role to play.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.560]   And it seems that it's a theory.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:26.160]   It still has to be backed up by more observation, but there is a good correlation between not
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.440]   only the passage of the solar system towards the center of the galaxy, there is one place
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.800]   where we get hit by asteroids because of the interaction I was telling you about.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.520]   But the other one is the climate.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   During the Milankovitch cycles, big jumps in life's evolution seem to be associated
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.760]   with snowball earth episodes.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.280]   We don't know why yet.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:02.320]   Snowball episode, intuitively you would think that they are connected to a decrease in life
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.760]   because the whole earth is covered in ice.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:13.200]   But for some reason, there were big jumps in evolution right after each of those episodes.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.680]   And today there are other things like why all of a sudden you have mutation that seems
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.600]   to be responsible for a big jump in evolution.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.760]   We are not clear yet.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.280]   So all of those things, when you're thinking about life elsewhere, are going to come into
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   play.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:36.640]   And I cannot tell you that a planet that remains habitable for much longer than the earth will
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.440]   have an evolutionary path that's the same or different.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.900]   Depends on extension, depends on climate, depends on whatnot.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.520]   It's a little bit surreal that we're two descendants of apes.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.560]   Well, I think that some people...
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.160]   Trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.000]   And I mean, we're very biased, even as...
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.800]   So you...
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.320]   We're biased as humans, you're less biased as a scientist.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.000]   But we still love earth.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.840]   We still don't know anything but this earth.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.920]   And so even though you try to get escape from thinking of what life is, in the search for
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.120]   the nature of life, we're still kind of connected to the way we understand the nature of life
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.120]   here on earth.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.680]   So I think that it's a little different than that.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.280]   We are biased when it comes to the origin of life.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.280]   Because well, we are the only model we know.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:42.320]   And as I said, it makes sense because it seems that a lot of stars like the sun appeared
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.200]   10 billion years ago.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.800]   And there are lots of worlds that really resemble the earth and lots of water out there and
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.920]   lots of conditions that could be a repeat of what we know.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.920]   And we know that this biochemistry works.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:03.200]   So as again, as I mentioned, what is going to change is really the evolution of a planet,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.440]   extinction, geology, etc.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.480]   But our model is probably very abundant.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.280]   I'm not saying that the endgame is going to resemble us because of all these extinction,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.280]   etc.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.700]   But this is a good bias.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.440]   It's one that has the number for it.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.480]   You know, the principle of mediocrity.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:31.720]   I think that in that case, it really applies where the earth is representative of an abundance
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.480]   of other worlds.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.160]   Now, of course, there can be other biochemistry.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.880]   We have some examples in our own solar system.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.920]   Titan might be a representative of that.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:48.360]   We are not very clear of the kind of biochemistry that can come out of a world where you have
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:54.240]   hydrocarbon lakes and rains and things like that.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.480]   But we are going there.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.720]   So we will learn something about this.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.120]   So the bias is right there.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.560]   The nature of life is different.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:12.680]   If really life is the best way the universe has to fight entropy, there is no bias there.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.520]   Because physics is the same all across the universe, at least the universe we know.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.400]   There might be other universes, but the one we know works with the same physics.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:29.080]   So if life is the best way to fight entropy, you can imagine that life permeates the entire
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.440]   universe.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.600]   And then the question might change to like flavors of ice cream.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:41.520]   What are the flavors of complexity that this process, this nature of life leads to?
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:47.640]   And there we might have bias about what complexity looks like, what beautiful complexity looks
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.640]   like.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:55.000]   We look at humans that operate a certain physical scale and time scale, and we think this is
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.240]   intelligence.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.460]   We have another problem.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.600]   We don't know what life is.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.360]   We don't know what intelligence is, and we don't know what consciousness is.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.200]   But we are trying to tackle the big question.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.680]   Do we know what complexity is also?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   You don't know.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   I think that we have to be honest.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.480]   And as a scientist, and I'm going to step back and talk about intelligence.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:22.280]   For me, a bacteria that has survived, like cyanobacteria, that has survived just like
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:27.400]   us four billion years in one incarnation or another, and actually they are very similar
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:34.040]   to the one that they were 3.5 billion years ago, it has some intelligence about its environment.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:42.680]   So for complexity, it might be that we need to take the world literally, which is an assemblage
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.640]   or additional capacity to gather, collect, store information.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.480]   Maybe this is something like that, or actually use that information to do something with
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.400]   it.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:59.040]   But I do completely agree with you when you talk about flavor of ice cream.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.880]   I think this is exactly it.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:09.680]   And I have a basic education about what physics is doing right now.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:17.920]   And I look at quantum physics and what it says about the universe, and about the connection,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.440]   about an atom here and an atom there, a photon here and a photon there.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.600]   And I am starting to put maybe wrongfully two and two together.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:34.680]   But in my mind, and of course it's nothing until I can prove it, but in my mind, the
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.800]   universe is connected everywhere in all different places.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:45.320]   So this life connection is something that, as you said, permeates the universe.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.000]   And the way to find life might be very different than to look for the origins of life.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.520]   I think it's a good thing to go out there and look for the origin of life somewhere
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:00.120]   else, because it's the manifestation of the nature of life that all of a sudden becomes
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.560]   apparent, evident to our eye.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:14.720]   But what I think would be our greatest achievement is that if we can find that process of life,
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:20.780]   because at that point, in my mind, the universe all of a sudden is going to illuminate itself
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.600]   with actually its living force.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.120]   But I can only call it a living force.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:33.080]   To me, this is what we are looking at, a universe that becomes more and more complex with time,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:38.840]   more and more able to gather information, and interestingly enough, why?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.840]   To understand itself.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:46.760]   So Sagan was right when he was saying, "We are the universe trying to understand itself."
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:54.000]   And the more we go, the more the universe becomes alive, maybe intelligent, and maybe
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   also conscious.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   - Conscious, self-aware.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   - Exactly.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.720]   - Through us.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.240]   It does make me a little bit sad as a human, just watching all the breakthroughs on the
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.600]   artificial intelligence side when applied to natural sciences, now more and more to
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   physics, that the creatures that will solve the question of the origin of the nature of
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.720]   life or just the process, the nature of life, will be AI systems.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   It makes me a bit sad to--
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   - I don't think so.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   - You don't think so.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.200]   You think humans will.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.760]   - At this point in time, remember, it was behind AI.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.600]   You know, I'm not buying in the singularity thing yet.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.920]   AI is not aware.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.080]   AI is being built by humans.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:49.240]   So AI is a tool, an extremely smart tool, as long as we build it.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.480]   And as long as we use it as a tool, it remains a tool.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.920]   And I think there is a lot of brouhaha, and of course, science fiction and movies, they
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   don't help.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.360]   - I gotta push back a little bit.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:08.360]   Yes, I agree with you for the most part in terms of brouhaha and sci-fi, but there is,
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:13.560]   like in the work of DeepMind, we can look at chess or we can look at protein folding.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.080]   So chess is a simple one to first look at.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:26.000]   What AlphaZero, which is their game-playing engine, was able to discover in "Ostockfish"
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.560]   about chess, humbles the best human players.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.040]   Not just it's better than them.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.200]   It comes up with ideas that the humans don't understand.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.520]   And so the AI now is telling you, even though it's programmed by humans, the AI is saying,
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.120]   like, "Sacrificing a pawn here is a good idea.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.920]   Sacrificing a queen or a bishop here is a good idea."
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:55.040]   And then you start to kind of intuit as a human why, but you don't deeply understand.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.880]   And you can say that AI is not conscious, it doesn't deeply understand the way humans
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.200]   do, but there's still a wisdom and a depth of knowledge in that chess-playing program
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.160]   that humans don't have.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.600]   And the same with the alpha fold, with protein folding, there's a, and now they're applying
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   it to physics, to simulating nuclear reactions and so on.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:20.120]   It feels like there might be a way to understand the nature of life, that we can kind of intuit
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:27.880]   poetically as humans, but the true understanding will come from a system that's much more computationally
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   sophisticated.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.800]   Again, you know, I would push back on my turn because I still think that humans give themselves
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.000]   the ability to do that by building that tool.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.520]   So the idea that the tool, you know, we are getting into the Kardashev scale and the dark
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.080]   forest and all these things, we can see the world this way.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:59.640]   At this point in time, for me, I still see a great tool.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:07.320]   Now whether the sci-fi scenario is going to, you know, happen, et cetera, I still think
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.800]   that we are far away from this.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:16.360]   But if that tool is capable of giving me a new perspective, it's just that we are starting
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:24.520]   to jump into a deeper cognition of what the universe is, whether it's through our brain
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.400]   or through a different way of gathering information.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.000]   Remember, this is what we do.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Yeah, humans are able to actually build tools and then like integrate them into their way
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.160]   of thinking.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.760]   Maybe another generation has to be born that is raised with those tools, but we seem to
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:47.680]   like take for granted all the cool technologies you integrate into your way of thinking.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.240]   A lot of people that are growing up now, their mind is integrated with the internet.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.400]   You basically reconfigure the way you memorize things.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   You no longer have to memorize a lot of facts because you can look them up really quickly.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:10.480]   And so like, so you reallocate a lot of resources for thinking versus memory of just strict
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.840]   facts, that kind of stuff.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.320]   And we integrate all of that.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   Yeah, and you know, there I would completely agree with you.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.000]   In fact, I wrote about this again in this new book that's coming out.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.440]   When is the book coming out?
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.440]   In January.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.920]   It will be in French actually, to start with.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   You wrote it in French?
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.760]   Actually, I wrote it first in English.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.400]   And I translated it into French.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:38.640]   So the English version is already pretty much ready to go if we find a publisher in the
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   US.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:49.040]   But anyways, the point being here that I looked at this as a relationship with technology
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.080]   as a complete change.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:57.520]   To me, this is the singularity more than anything else, which is the co-evolution of human with
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.320]   technology, not anymore with their environment.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.000]   Why we are messing up the environment right now, why we don't respond to pandemic the
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.040]   way we should, because we are disconnected to the environment we are taking our information
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.240]   from and we were adapting from.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.920]   Right now, exactly as you said, we take the information from the web, from the phones,
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.920]   etc.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.680]   We have no filter over that information.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.880]   Before you were out in the environment, the information you get is the one the planet
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.240]   is sending you.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.420]   Now this information is coming from different way.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.080]   You have no way of knowing if the information is correct or not.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.360]   I got to push back on that.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.960]   No, you look at this as an ecosystem and it explains a lot of our behavior.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.160]   I like that you said teenagers.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   So the technology, I think, when we move past the teenager stage, enriches our ability to
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.520]   sense the earth, to understand what's going on with the environment.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.080]   It's just that we're very, so it's not that technology disconnects us from the environment.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.680]   It gives us more tools with which to understand what's going on with the environment.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.560]   That's true for the people who are building the tools and know how to use it.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   Take those tools now, put them in the general public with no filter, which is happening
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.940]   with social media, which is happening with a lot of things.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.440]   And you see the disaster this is creating.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.440]   It's not the disaster.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   It is.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.680]   You sound like a parent talking about a teenager.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   Yes.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:29.760]   It's the growing pains of a civilization that is becoming deeply connected.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.960]   We can communicate all across the world, even through the pandemic.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.920]   That's the good thing about technology.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.200]   This is also something I wrote.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.680]   It's not the tools we create that are bad.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.120]   It's the way we use them.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   Yes.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   But we're learning.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   This is the cool thing about humans.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.680]   Well, and hopefully we'll do all the learning before it's too late, because our response
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.440]   to what's going on in the environment, our response to pandemics is deeply connected
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.960]   to this disconnect we have with nature.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:05.000]   Anyways, we all agree that we are in growing pains and hopefully we can move forward because
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.400]   there is a fantastic universe, something absolutely magical around us.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.640]   And I'm talking as a scientist.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:19.400]   I mean, there is magic, not in sense of trickery, but in sense of wonder around us.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:30.960]   And there are so many signs where we are getting so close to revolutions in cosmology, in astrobiology,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.580]   in astronomy, which I think to me, this is where the hope lies.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.680]   And also an awakening of understanding that we need to be in equilibrium with the planet
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.320]   if we want to move forward.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.920]   Because even though we have these big dreams of going on Mars and the Moon, and listen,
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.240]   I am a planetary geologist, so I am all for exploration.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:57.040]   Right now, the Moon or Mars is not going to save your butt, because for the logistics
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.560]   will still depend very much on the Earth and for a long time.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:12.440]   I think this time we are living in will be remembered as a pivot in our history for a
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.920]   number of reasons.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.560]   A time where there is a growing consciousness, where we are creating tools that are going
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:25.880]   a little bit ahead of us, that we have some difficult time to catch up on, where we have
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:32.080]   to deal with a population that's way too big for the planet we have.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:39.000]   We need to really learn a sense of balance and maturity as a civilization.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.200]   So how is this going to unfold?
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.040]   Right now I have no clue.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:52.000]   I draw a lot of optimism from the similar things that happened many decades ago when
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.560]   nuclear weapons were developed.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.760]   Boy, was that at the time even more terrifying.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.680]   You just now created weapons that could destroy the entirety of life on Earth.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.800]   Or not entirety, but a lot of it.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.400]   And we somehow found a balance.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.120]   And the threat constantly is out there.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   And that threat has been made more visceral in recent times because of the war in Ukraine.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.240]   But we find a balance somehow.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:28.040]   I have a thread of optimism for human civilization that we figure it out.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.760]   We're clever teenagers, I think.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.600]   We are clever teenagers.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.080]   There is definitely a thread of optimism.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.040]   But I think it's thin.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:45.480]   It's thin because something that has changed as well is the mentality of humans.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:57.880]   Although the threat was terrifying when nuclear weapons were created, there was a sense of
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:03.400]   limits you were willing to push in the threats.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:09.160]   There was a sense of decency, of moral values.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:16.080]   It was not perfect, but it was at least a time where people could come together from
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.280]   very different perspectives and agree that something was more important than destroying
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.280]   everything.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.880]   But that's so hilarious you say that.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:30.040]   Yes, you're talking about a small slither of humans, which is the scientists in the
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   Manhattan Project, perhaps.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.040]   No, absolutely not.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:38.880]   But that was also the time when over 100 million people were tortured or murdered in China
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   and in Europe.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   No, no, I agree with that.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.640]   I'm not talking about scientists here.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.960]   Actually, I'm talking about politicians.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.000]   We've gone beyond that point now.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.680]   This is what I'm worried about.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.800]   I mean, torture, et cetera.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.160]   Unfortunately, well, we are apes, exactly what you said.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:03.280]   So I think that there is a lot to be, not to blame grandpa for that, but because we
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.200]   can always get better.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.400]   Grandpa was a wild man.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.040]   But we have to improve a lot on that side before we can claim that we are a mature civilization.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:19.080]   When you, just because you mentioned the magic, when you look out there, perhaps this is not
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.820]   a scientific question, but...
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.760]   You don't have to be scientific all the time.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.520]   Yeah, well, you said magic.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:31.280]   So there's a magic to magic that is in part scientific and in part, I don't know, whatever
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.240]   fills us with awe as humans when we look up at the stars.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:40.400]   Do you think the universe is full of life or not?
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:46.880]   When you're sitting, drinking some wine, looking up at the stars and wandering as a human,
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:53.160]   do you think we're alone or do you think life is everywhere?
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   I am going to make such an unmagical response to that.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:06.400]   My response is, that's the scientific response, that if we are alone, then the universe is
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.240]   a statistical absurdity.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:17.360]   And I have no doubt in my mind, and that is an unscientific response as well, but I have
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.280]   no doubt in my mind that the universe is teeming with life.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.040]   What if it keeps dying?
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.760]   This is what life does, unfortunately.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:40.360]   So that extinction, as a process, as a part of the process of life, extinction seems to
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.340]   be a fundamental, both negative and positive component.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:52.120]   So what if all the complex life out there just keeps dying and not making way for...
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:58.480]   Like we're actually a statistical anomaly in us being able to survive that L in the
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:04.240]   Drake equation, being able to survive long enough to form complex organisms of the kind
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.720]   like mammals are, things with brains, things that are able to...
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.280]   L is not about that.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:15.520]   L is about how long a civilization is capable of being detectable, which means that rich
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.800]   technologies and being detectable.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.840]   Okay, so there's a more nuanced things to L, because you can have intelligent civilizations
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.200]   that are not very detectable.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.920]   Yeah, we had civilization for thousands of years.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.320]   We started to be detectable 150 years ago.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:38.200]   So it's about technology, technology that we can actually capture from space.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:44.900]   You become visible to your neighbors, and this is all about the Fermi paradox, right?
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:50.440]   It takes time, obviously, if we're taking again ourselves as a model, but this is the
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:56.520]   only one we have, to get to the point where we become detectable.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.840]   But look at the age of the universe.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:05.680]   Even if life as we understand it, not saying even as we know it, but as we can understand
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:13.200]   it, started 10 billion years ago, and it takes 4 billion years to get to the point where
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.920]   it becomes detectable.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.880]   That means that the first planet where those civilizations started off, starting to be
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.520]   detectable when we were still cyanobacteria in pond.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:27.480]   So they were, you know, throwing messages that were passing above our heads at that
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.880]   point.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.680]   And those civilizations, when you look at them now, close to 10 billion years after
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:39.040]   the start, so their sun would be dead.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.400]   In the best case scenario, they move somewhere else.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:50.160]   And what that means is that civilizations are going to rise, die, or move and transform
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   themselves.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.680]   We can see ourselves changing.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.440]   We know that humans are still changing as a species.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:02.360]   The human being in a thousand or even 500 years from now might not be looking a lot
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.480]   like we are doing right now.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.200]   Who knows where we will be.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.680]   We might be migrating into our planetary system.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.480]   We might be migrating somewhere else.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.080]   Well, you said migrating, but it seems when you look at life, it doesn't necessarily
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.320]   migrate, it expands.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:25.080]   So it's not "or" place A or place B, it's place A and place B.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.840]   It could be.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.680]   We are talking about the human civilization here.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.240]   So there are different factors.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:39.040]   If you are a cyanobacteria or any type of, even a mammal, that doesn't have the technology
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:45.880]   to escape the planet we were born on, then it's plan A, it's right there.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.440]   Whatever happens to your planet, you are tied to it, you cannot escape it.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.960]   For humans, it's a little different.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:57.280]   It's A and B, or whatever we can.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:05.240]   So we have to expect that a number of the extraterrestrial civilizations that might
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.360]   be technologically advanced, a number of them will have disappeared just because they
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:17.160]   were on the course of their evolution, or because their sun ran out of fuel and they
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:23.640]   didn't have a way to escape, or they were wiped out by any kind of event.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.800]   And then there will be those that survive.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.640]   Everything I've seen from life, it seems obvious that there's life everywhere out
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.640]   there.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:39.880]   In fact, maybe I don't understand the jump from bacteria enough, but it seems obvious
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.920]   that there's intelligent civilizations out there.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.080]   Now I don't know how to define intelligence, but there's beautiful complexity.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:53.840]   Like when you look at a, I've looked at enough cellular automata, which is a very
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:52:00.920]   primitive mathematical construction, that when you run, complexity emerges.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.560]   I've looked at that enough to know that it just seems like there's complexity everywhere
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   out there.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:09.600]   So that's why I'm deeply puzzled by the Fermi paradox.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.520]   It makes no sense to me.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.120]   I mean, they have trivial answers to it.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.640]   Why haven't aliens at scale not shown up?
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:25.520]   I think the two possible options for me is either we're too dumb to see it.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.520]   They're already here.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.280]   They've been talking to us through processes we just don't understand.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:36.920]   Like what we experience as life here on Earth is actually there everywhere.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.760]   Aliens could be consciousness.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.240]   That when we feel love for one another, that could be aliens.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   When we, I don't know, or feel fear or whatever, that could be aliens.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.120]   I have to agree with you.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.600]   None of this is scientifically provable.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.940]   Right now we talked a little bit already about that.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:53:04.400]   But I would say that I do not adhere to the Fermi paradox because it's very anthropomorphic.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.880]   It's an interesting exercise, let's put it that way.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:14.520]   But it's a typical example of seeing the universe through our own eyes.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.840]   And this is where the limitation is.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.600]   Understanding what's going on with complexity, as you said, and looking at the biophysical
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.320]   model and theories for the nature of life.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:33.920]   I would agree that probably this extraterrestrial message is all around us.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.240]   We're not yet capable of picking it up.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:41.780]   But I think, unfortunately, even though that makes me sad, the way to pick it up is by
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.800]   studying life here on Earth, doing some of the science you're doing, better understand
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:53.400]   the nature of life until you realize, holy crap, the thing I was looking for all along
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.240]   has been here all along.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   Right?
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.200]   - Well, you know, a good example of that, and it doesn't need to be an extraterrestrial
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:08.200]   civilization, look at something that I really, you know, whether or not it's real, I don't
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:13.000]   care because in terms of intellectual exercise, I think it's fantastic.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.280]   Look at the shadow biosphere.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:25.320]   The idea that life didn't appear only once on Earth, but there were many different pathways
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.840]   of it.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:38.160]   And today we know and we study the tree of life that led to us, from Luca to us.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:45.760]   And the shadow biosphere is telling us that there is, or there are, other pathways that
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:53.280]   came up at the time where life originated, but they are so different that we cannot recognize
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.920]   them as being living.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:03.960]   And we cannot pick them up in our test because our tests are being built to recognize life
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.960]   as we know it.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:14.360]   And for me, again, I don't know if this theory will be verified or it would be discredited,
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:21.200]   but what I like about it is that it forces me to think on how do I look for life?
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   I don't know.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.740]   So that starts here on our planet, not even with little green men.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:36.300]   It starts with very simple life that can be so different that it might be just right in
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.680]   front of our nose and we don't see it.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:46.880]   - So that probably starts with the scientific humility of realizing that we might be too
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:50.680]   biased in our understanding of what is the phenomena we're trying to study.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.600]   - Yeah, I don't like the term bias because it involves some moral connotation.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.600]   - Sure.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:02.100]   - But I understand the bias in terms of scientific pathway, intellectual framework, definitely.
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.080]   - What do you think about the UFO sightings?
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   So the widespread experiences that people have in seeing different phenomena that are
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:20.600]   mysterious, that people project ideas about whether it's aliens or not, but they can't
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:26.440]   explain it and there's pictures and data and then the government is involved in releasing
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.320]   footage and all that kind of stuff.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.080]   And that seems to captivate the public.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   - It always does.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.080]   - It's imagination.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   - It always does.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:37.960]   I mean, you know, there are a number of things that captivate people, especially children,
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.680]   actually, dinosaurs and aliens.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.680]   - You're still a child.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:44.160]   - Yeah, we are all still child at heart.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.840]   So about UFOs, I am a scientist and I'm a citizen.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.320]   So I'm going to tell you a couple of things.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:55.480]   I don't mind talking about that at all because I think as a scientist, this is extremely
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:00.040]   interesting because the thing I don't know, I want to learn about it.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.520]   This is more knowledge.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.640]   So we all know the statistics about UFOs.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:11.240]   95% of them are just natural phenomenon or things that are being misinterpreted.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.240]   We know that.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:19.400]   Then you have the 2% that might be secret programs by whatever government, it's out
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:20.400]   there.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:26.920]   Another percent say is about natural phenomenon that we don't know about yet and we cannot
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   explain.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.160]   And then there is this tiny percentage that don't fall into all these categories of thing.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:38.160]   And I think that the report about the UAPs falls into the same kind of scheme, except
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:45.040]   that now they have at least some patterns of speed of other things that were in the
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   report.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:56.800]   Today, we don't know if these sightings are part of military program or actual UFOs.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.080]   I always run into that question because of course, as the director of the Carl Sagan
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.480]   Center at the Study Institute, I received a number of emails about the subject.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.520]   People are confused about what the Study Institute is.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.720]   We are not studying UFOs.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:15.080]   We are studying, we are actually looking for messages.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:20.600]   The way I put it, you know, usually is that we are studying extraterrestrial in their
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.440]   natural habitat.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:29.000]   And the UFO people are trying to understand whether they invaded our aerial space.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.680]   So this is two very different things.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:39.040]   And unfortunately, over the years, I actually respect very much people who are trying to
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:46.280]   go to the bottom of what UFO are following some very scientific ways of doing this.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:49.840]   There are very, very credible agencies doing this.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.240]   Unfortunately, there is a folklore around UFOs.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:59:00.160]   And this has been a huge disservice to the scientific community.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:05.040]   And this is why you have been having that much pushback for a long time by the scientific
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:11.520]   community because no congressman in the world wants to tell their taxpayer that they are
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:15.120]   supporting something that looking for flying saucers.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.440]   And you know, when you see what's happening, it's terrifying.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:28.600]   And I am actually concerned, you know, about that relationship that people do between folklore
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.880]   and real search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:41.760]   In fact, it's been so bad that until today, there is no government agency that is actually
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.440]   funding the SETI search.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.400]   It is a private funded endeavor.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:52.260]   What NASA funds right now, which is a progress, is a search for techno signature, which means
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:57.440]   that when you are looking at the atmosphere of a planet, you look for some disequilibrium
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.240]   that could tell you that something is there.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:08.920]   But it's not going to fund an institute or whatnot that is looking for messages or other
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.920]   things like that.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.760]   Is that just have to do with a taboo associated with the folklore?
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.760]   Yes.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:21.040]   And I think there was a pushback from the political arena decades ago about that at
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.640]   the time where all the flying saucer were coming out.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.240]   And then the SETI Institute got it started.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:37.880]   But now there is more of a willingness to look at the UAP UFO phenomenon from a scientific
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   standpoint.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:47.440]   So much so that the government is actually seeking some help from a scientific institution.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.400]   And there are programs to start looking into those phenomenon.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.520]   And as a scientist, I am interested.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.400]   What I'm not interested in, again, Carl Sagan comes back here.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.160]   I don't want to believe.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.800]   I want to know.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:10.640]   And so to know, you have to have a real experiment, you have to have observation, and you have
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.720]   things that are done the right way.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.160]   I don't want to have somebody that starts with "what if" as a question and then turns
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.880]   this "what if" into the only argument and the only conclusion there is.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880]   You understand what I'm saying?
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.240]   But still, I think it's valuable to appreciate the mystery and not deny the mystery.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.240]   So...
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   No, the mystery is there.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.920]   But what I don't want is people taking advantage of the public and making money out of folklore.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.120]   Well, let me flip that.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.560]   I understand.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.480]   But so there is a folklore in like the stuff I do, AI and robotics, for example.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.440]   There's a clear fear terminator in movies and all those kind of stuff.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.680]   You could say that I'm very concerned about this miscalibrated understanding of the public,
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.900]   of what robots' role are in society.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.840]   Or you could see it as a, let's use a metaphor of a wave.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.760]   You can say this giant wave that we'll call folklore is a really bad idea.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.280]   We need to avoid it.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   We need to hide.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280]   We need to build dams.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.600]   Or you can be a surfer and ride the wave as a scientist.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.560]   To me, the fact that people are wondering about the mystery of UFOs, it means they're
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   wondering.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560]   No, they are.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:27.960]   But the thing, I will stop surfing that wave when it comes back to bite an entire scientific
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.960]   discipline.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   When it hurts the science, sure.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:38.560]   For now, the past 60 years, we were not able to raise money from the government, no grants.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:46.080]   It's a discipline that has no postdoc or very little postdoc, just because there is a fear
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.600]   of that folklore on the political arena.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.440]   People don't want to be associated with that because they confuse the two.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.400]   So I stop there.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.240]   And as the director of the Carl Sagan Center, I am just very happy to see now that there
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:09.360]   is a course correction in the government seeking scientific investigators for this kind of
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360]   issues.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.520]   And hopefully that will right the ship there.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520]   I love it.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520]   I love to see it.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.400]   But I want, and I love our little disagreements.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:23.160]   I'm doing so obviously respectfully and with love, and it makes for a fun conversation.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:29.340]   But I think, you know, just like with surfing a wave, there's some level of, the more you
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.000]   resist it, the worse it is.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   So I--
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   - We didn't resist it.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   - Yes, it--
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.480]   - It didn't come from us and we pay the price.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:47.080]   - I just think that the role of a scientist in part in the 21st century, and we talked
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:54.080]   about social media, is to direct this sense of wonder that people have into a direction
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.040]   of the rigors of science.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.520]   - I think we do that pretty well.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520]   - I would disagree.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520]   - I don't think so.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.360]   - I would say he does much better, but there's other places in science where--
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.920]   - The search for life is fairly, it's a fairly easy place to, you know, draw the wonder of
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920]   people.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   - Yes, 100%.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.480]   - Because it's a profound question that pretty much everybody has.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.440]   - But I think, I just want to highlight the fact that I think a lot of scientists, my
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.720]   colleagues, friends, think that all you need to do is science.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:28.480]   All you need to do is the scientific process, the peer review process, the data and so on.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:33.200]   But I think communication is actually a fundamental part of the process.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.840]   Because it has to do with funding, but it also has to do with like, we're a bunch of
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.800]   humans trying to ask big questions, trying to figure this whole puzzle out.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.440]   - I totally agree.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:48.480]   We do have more public presentation at the Institute than peer reviewed articles.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.520]   And believe me, we have lots of peer reviewed articles.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.840]   So our scientists are out there and they are sharing the wonder of discoveries.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.320]   And it's so easy these days.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.240]   I mean, there is not one day, tell me about writing a book right now about the search
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.000]   for life in the universe.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.760]   I mean, it's almost every single day I had to correct something in the chapters I was
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760]   writing.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.800]   - So SETI in terms of both signatures and signals is a pretty active field.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.400]   - So it's getting better right now.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   It's getting better.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.800]   But remember that the SETI Institute is not only about the search for extraterrestrial
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.800]   intelligence.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:29.840]   It's the historical root of the Institute, but it's about 10% of what we do.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:35.160]   In fact, we are searching for life in the universe from the origins of life to extraterrestrial
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.440]   intelligence.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.960]   So 90% of everything else is exoplanet.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:47.240]   For instance, we have a good chunk of the Kepler team that is actually with the SETI
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.040]   Institute and they are working with tests right now.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.760]   Some already have some time on the GEMS web.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.240]   We have astrobiologists, we have astronomers.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:02.040]   - And those are looking for data, for signals, for planets out there outside of our solar
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040]   system.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.200]   - Yeah, go to analog places to try and understand the type of life that survive in planetary
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   type environments.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:14.920]   I mean, people are always surprised when I tell them, you know, whatever flies in the
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:20.940]   solar system, has flown or will be flying, we are involved.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.920]   So this is not something that pops in everybody's mind when they are thinking about the SETI
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:32.220]   Institute because we started off as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, but the
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:37.560]   Institute has really bloomed into the search for life along the Drake equation, all the
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.580]   terms of the Drake equation.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.500]   - Just to clarify, 'cause by the way, you're saying a bunch of terms sometimes, it's good
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.700]   to return to the basics.
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:52.060]   When you're saying whatever's flown, SETI is a part of the things that are flown.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:57.320]   So we, 'cause we're using we elusive sometimes, we say we humans and sometimes we SETI.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.880]   So the SETI is really broadly involved.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.880]   A lot of the fingertips reaching out there towards the stars.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.900]   - Think about Mars involved in landing site selection, in instrument that are actually
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:15.680]   on board, some of the mission in science teams, for instance, Cassini, New Horizons, also
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.040]   missions that will be coming.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.580]   It's the search for life, we do this all across the Drake equation.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:29.560]   So SETI is part of it and it's our route and it's expanding a little bit right now.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.380]   We hope it will continue to expand.
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.020]   So this is a good time for the Institute.
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:40.460]   And it also, in my mind, was the very first astrobiology Institute because we have this
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:47.820]   multi-disciplinary approach where I can bring many of the scientists from different domains
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:50.420]   and disciplines to think about a question.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:55.240]   And as you know, discoveries happen at the nexus of disciplines.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.900]   And it's really a privilege when you are in an Institute like that.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:05.180]   - You've dived in volcanic lakes at high altitudes to study the creatures within.
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:10.940]   Can you tell me the technical, the fun, the human story of that effort?
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:17.180]   - The image that is associated with a scientist is the person with the white coat in the lab.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:24.340]   In fact, a number of us at the Institute are athletes doing extremes, what would be considered
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.340]   extreme stuff.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:33.460]   And I mean, it's fun, it's a little dangerous too, but it's to get data and more knowledge.
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.140]   So there are so many stories.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.140]   I don't even know where--
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:40.620]   - When was the first time you did a dangerous thing with a volcano?
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:50.260]   - So the first one associated to the search for life, understanding, was in 2002 where
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:55.500]   I started climbing those high volcanoes in the Andes that are 20,000 footers.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.420]   The view out there is just beautiful.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:04.740]   - You got, you're so hilarious at spending almost no time on some epic things.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.900]   I love this, okay.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.900]   How tall are these volcanoes?
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.420]   What are you doing with a volcano?
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.260]   What's required to prepare for that?
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.100]   What does a mission like that look like?
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:19.180]   I mean, that is true that this is science embodied.
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.580]   It's like athletics and it's science and you're studying the extreme conditions of life on
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.420]   Earth, extreme beauty of life on Earth in those conditions.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:31.460]   So what are we talking about with this volcano?
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.460]   How big is it?
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:37.180]   - So remember when we were talking about how do I understand how I search for life on Mars?
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.900]   This is how it started for me.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.940]   And then I looked at environment, in my head started going through the environments on
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.620]   Earth, that would be good analysis.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:52.660]   And then you only have a few in the Andes in that case are some of the best in the world
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.300]   just because of the aridity of the place.
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:04.300]   And the higher you go, the least atmosphere you have, the more UV radiation you have.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.480]   And the Andes are volcanic, hydrothermal, plus you have the climate change that's coming,
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.400]   you have evaporation.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.920]   It's a picture of Mars 3.5 billion years ago.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:21.380]   And so now you are actually entering a time machine, basically.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:32.740]   So remember I'm a diver and the first time I got in 2002 to the places we wanted to explore,
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:41.020]   all of a sudden I was standing at 14,000 foot looking at 20,000 feet and saying, "Okay,
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.020]   well I need to get up there."
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.020]   - Are you scared?
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.020]   - No.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:48.020]   No, because we are prepared.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.900]   And the only thing I didn't know is if I was going to be able to make it to the top, because
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.720]   now you're dealing with high altitude.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.020]   You can deal with high altitude sickness, you can deal with a number of things.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:01.560]   And for God's sake, these are volcanoes and they are dormant, they are not extinct.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.300]   That can bite us a couple of times.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.580]   - What was your preparation for that kind of thing?
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.580]   I mean, this is...
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:12.460]   - There is a lot of, you know, hiking and trekking at high altitude around here, but
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:17.820]   not so high because we don't have anything closer to those elevations around here in
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.620]   the US.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:24.620]   But in volcanic environment, climbing volcanoes here, we have plenty of those.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.620]   Diving as well.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:31.980]   I am a free diver, so this is where it's going to be hilarious because I started with a complete
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:38.940]   irrational fear of pressurized vessels that comes from an incident in my childhood.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:44.660]   And so I became a free diver to avoid having to carry oxygen tanks on my back.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.700]   - Free diving is diving without...
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.380]   - Without anything, just your lungs, right?
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.780]   - That started from childhood.
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:57.500]   - Yeah, no, it was to the point where when I saw a pressurized vessel, like a methane
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:03.860]   tank or anything, I would be, you know, going around and put a lot of distance between me
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.200]   and that tank.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.240]   So I was not going to carry any oxygen tank.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.800]   And the first time I actually dived at the summit of that lake was free diving.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.280]   People look at me like I'm nuts.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.320]   Well, maybe I am a little bit.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   - People that work with you as well?
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.960]   I mean, that kind of seems kind of nuts.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.960]   - No, we knew...
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   - It's a risk.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:30.640]   - Actually, it's a lot of less of a risk than getting with conventional air.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.880]   And I can explain that.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:41.200]   But ultimately, what decided me to certify SCUBA and go over my fear was that as a scientist,
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:47.640]   I needed more time at the bottom of the lake to sample, you know, rationally, take my time
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.440]   to think.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:56.420]   And I can stay quite long enough as a free diver underwater.
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:01.480]   But the last thing you want to do at 20,000 feet is to come up at the surface with empty
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:07.160]   lungs, because there is not much you can breathe out there to replenish your oxygen.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:12.800]   So definitely your time underwater is cut short just for safety.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.960]   And I realized that it was not a good trade-off for me at some point.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.360]   So I certified SCUBA.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:26.000]   And after three years of exploring that lake free diving, we finally came up with a full
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.060]   SCUBA diving expedition.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:36.080]   But we were diving with rebreathers, which means that we dived with pure oxygen.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:45.040]   So rebreathers give you a bag with stuff that looks like cat litters in it, which is basically
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:50.880]   to absorb the CO2 that you are expelling when you're breathing.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.620]   And they're recycling oxygen this way.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.120]   So basically you are rebreathing your own respiration.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.120]   Wow.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120]   How long can you do that?
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.600]   So what's interesting about that technology?
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:10.620]   So it's very interesting, because then that completely avoids the potential issues you
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.920]   may have with the binds.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:19.420]   When you are diving, the risk of bubbles trapped in your lungs because of different pressures
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.340]   and different gases.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:26.040]   So there's a complexity to the flow of oxygen underwater.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:30.960]   When you are breathing regular air, when you are SCUBA diving here, you know that you have
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.400]   to do some different...
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.980]   When you're coming back, when you're diving deep and you have conventional air, then you
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:44.240]   need to stop so that you can equalize the gases in your lungs.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:52.160]   If you come back too fast, then you can have air bubbles stuck, and then you can raise
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.400]   the binds, which you can risk to be paralyzed.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.740]   You can raise a number of nasty issues.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.740]   And we wanted absolutely to avoid that.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.660]   So diving with pure oxygen avoids this completely.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:12.400]   And it has another benefit at high altitude is that, well, the greater risk when you're
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.820]   at high altitude is altitude sickness.
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.240]   What is altitude sickness?
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.580]   It's just you not having enough oxygen in your blood.
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:23.500]   So this was a good benefit.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.500]   It was a good trade-off.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:29.100]   We were lucky enough to be also trained by the military.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:35.820]   So we came up with not the civilian rebreather, which is the big thing on the back that you
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:36.880]   carry on your back.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.860]   We actually were given Navy SEALs commando rebreathers.
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.500]   You worked with Navy SEALs for this?
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.100]   The director of military operations.
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:51.740]   Yes, we were trained like astronauts for three months.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:57.640]   I spent more time, I had a joke that if somebody wanted to reach me, they better put a phone
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.960]   line at the bottom of the swimming pool because this is where I was.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.040]   So we trained and we trained, and our manual about the safety was about that thick.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.260]   So it was a real operation.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:15.060]   That was three years into it because when you are free diving in the years prior, there
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.060]   is no risk.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.020]   You don't have any other gas in your lung than what you are breathing.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:25.420]   The only risk is come short of air and then you're in trouble, which happened to me one
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.420]   time seriously.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.580]   Tell me about that time.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:32.220]   I got to ask you about free diving before we return to the rebreathers.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:35.260]   Well all these lakes I had altitude, they are cold.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:40.060]   They are the minimum temperature that you can have on bodies of water, clear bodies
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:44.020]   of water, which is four degrees C. It's very, very cold.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:55.200]   And so you cannot just dive with a wetsuit.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.480]   So the idea was to take a dry suit.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.820]   And I learned how to free dive with a dry suit, which is really the worst thing you
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:06.820]   can do.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.820]   What's a wetsuit?
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.820]   What's a dry suit?
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:13.440]   So a wetsuit is usually what you use in the ocean when it's not too cold.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.640]   You can use also a dry suit.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.420]   But the wetsuit basically is going to keep you warm because water is getting into the
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:25.280]   suit and at the contact of your skin is getting to body temperature.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.920]   And so for a while you can dive like that.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.440]   But in the ocean here, that's fine.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.600]   The dry suit is the opposite.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.880]   It's completely closed, which means that you don't have any contact with the water
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:47.560]   outside and you keep your warmth through your body temperature and even clothing that you
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.560]   can put into it.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:54.840]   So these dry suits, they are used by divers who go really deep in very cold water and
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.680]   need to stay a long time underwater.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.240]   So what's the bad part?
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:10.000]   The bad part is that when you have those dry suits, you have a lot of air that can be trapped
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.240]   in it.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.000]   Usually we do what we call burping the suit.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.360]   It's not a very pleasant expression, but you get in the water and as soon as you get
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.000]   in the water, you can see the air pockets all over the place, right?
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.280]   So you burp the suit, you open the valve and the air comes out.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:31.960]   Once you have done that, then you look with your lead belt and you know when you're ready
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.080]   to go down.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:39.240]   And so what happened that day is that I actually did burp the suit, but didn't realize I burped
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.080]   it completely.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:49.600]   And so I went down and immediately I felt an air pocket going to my legs.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:56.480]   So basically air was trapped in the suit and went on my legs as I was diving like that.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.640]   And so I didn't pay too much attention to that.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.920]   Because you're diving down?
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.760]   Yeah, I was diving down.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:07.240]   And so I didn't pay too much attention about that as I was busy.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.000]   Just an awkward position.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.560]   But then I wanted to turn and go up.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.840]   Well no can do.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.400]   I was just like a buoy.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.520]   And I was like that.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.240]   So the first time I say, "Okay."
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.000]   I tried a second time and a third time.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.560]   And by the fourth time, I kind of realized I was in trouble.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.880]   And the fifth time I say, "Okay, now you better give it your best try.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.840]   Otherwise it's going to be big trouble."
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.120]   So this is free diving?
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.280]   I was free diving.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.240]   And then you can't.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.240]   And I cannot turn around.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.240]   What were you feeling?
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.520]   I mean, is there a panic or not?
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   No.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   There is no panic because you can't.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.160]   You cannot afford to be panicking.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.840]   In fact, you are always thinking because there is training.
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.640]   This is the best part about training.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.360]   Your training allows you that space to keep you cool and composed, which you need to be
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.520]   in that kind of situation.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:08.440]   And so finally, after the fifth time, I was able to rectify the position and get myself
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.960]   up.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.400]   But when I got up, my lungs were empty.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.880]   I had been in the water for quite some time.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.440]   And I knew what was going to happen.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:25.200]   So I decided to just be the plank, not move and don't do anything.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.040]   Just open my mouth and try to suck oxygen.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:33.880]   But obviously oxygen at 6,000 meters, 20,000 feet, there is not that much.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.560]   It's about a little, it's 48% of what you breathe at sea level.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:49.040]   So although it was noon at that time, the sky stayed pretty dark and starry for about
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040]   a minute or two.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.040]   So just stars everywhere?
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.040]   Oh my God, yes.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.040]   The funny thing was...
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.920]   And that's the first time you experienced that kind of, I mean, can you possibly train
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920]   for that?
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.880]   Like, can you also pass out?
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.880]   Oh, you could.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:09.800]   I mean, the fact that I was already seeing dark was a real sign that my brain was starved
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.520]   of oxygen.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:18.120]   And I had one of my friends or colleagues on the shore just telling me, because I'd
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.920]   been under for a little while and say, "Is everything okay?"
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.440]   And I remember trying to say something and I was just like...
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:31.600]   That's I think the best lie I ever, ever...
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600]   I get the thumb down.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.160]   You were lying to the friend and maybe to yourself?
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:41.080]   No, because I knew I was going to be okay, but it took me to be still for a few minutes.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.120]   Well, can you talk about free diving?
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.680]   I mean, what's the technical skill involved here?
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.640]   It just seems exceptionally difficult.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.160]   Like for most people that swim, you go underwater.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160]   It's hard.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.560]   So what's the skill there?
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:03.040]   I think you probably can get good or better at free diving by training.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.400]   So you have different techniques.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.120]   You can train in swimming pool and you can say...
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:13.840]   Frankly for me, I go at the bottom of the swimming pool and I sit there.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.560]   And then you have relaxation techniques.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.560]   Some people meditate.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.560]   I can't.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.160]   I am not a good person that can meditate.
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.040]   Or if I do, I don't know about it.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:32.120]   But my way of doing things and taking my mind off the situation I'm in is by singing in
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   my head.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.720]   I love music or hearing music.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:40.240]   And in fact, knowing the kind of song I'm singing, I know about the length of time that
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.040]   I'm staying underwater as well.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.760]   So this is my own way.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.760]   People have different ways.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.960]   What kind of music are we talking about?
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960]   All sorts of music.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.840]   It can be classical, it can be pop music, you know, just songs.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:23:00.680]   When you really know that you are relaxed and something I experienced actually at 20,000
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:07.400]   feet, which was the greatest experience of my life in those terms, is when you forget
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.400]   that you have water around you.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.520]   At that point, you cannot tell whether you are the water or water is you.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.500]   There is actually no separation anymore.
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:21.460]   And I felt that when I was training in the swimming pool.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:28.820]   I never could have imagined that I would feel that way once on top of that volcano.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:30.020]   And it happened.
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.300]   And it was absolutely amazing.
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:38.420]   It was, you know, we were talking about how life consciousness permeates the universe.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:44.540]   At that point in time, on that volcano, that day, it took me by surprise.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.860]   I was not expecting it.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:54.380]   Everything around me, the lake was arctic blue with all the ray of the suns.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.980]   You could tell them apart, every single one of them.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:00.520]   I was surrounded by golden darts.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.780]   And it was the most incredible experience.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:11.140]   And I don't know if it's that kind of environment that led me to just, you know, go into whatever
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.080]   state of meditation or whatnot.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:20.580]   But all of a sudden, there was no separation anymore between me, the water, the volcano.
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:24.220]   And if I came with questions, they didn't matter anymore.
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:29.340]   Because for that fraction of a second, it seemed that I had all the answers in the universe.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:32.360]   Was it the connectedness with everything?
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.660]   You can call it that way.
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.680]   I still don't know what it means, you know, literally.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.460]   But it is that moment where you feel that it doesn't matter.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.080]   It really doesn't matter anymore.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.300]   It was absolute peace, absolute understanding.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.980]   And it was incredible.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.540]   It was an absolute awareness.
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:57.020]   - Could you describe it as beautiful?
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:58.340]   - That could go beyond that.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:07.100]   I think that there is clearly in my mind today, no words that can express how perfect this
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.100]   was.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:10.700]   - Does that start to speak to why you love diving?
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:16.540]   Or is there something special about that place, diving at such elevations and volcanoes?
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:21.140]   - You know, I started diving pretty much, this is the first thing I did when I was near
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.140]   water.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:27.100]   In fact, there is a very fun little incident with my parents, me being on the shore of
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.540]   a lake on vacation.
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.900]   I was three years old, maybe.
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.980]   And I had these little lifesavers, you know, on my arms.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.100]   And my parents were not watching.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:44.980]   And in my little brain, I still can remember today, saying, "Well, nothing bad can happen
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:45.980]   to me.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.940]   I cannot drown if I go underwater."
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:49.460]   See that's the logic of a three-year-old.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.460]   - Yes.
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.460]   It kind of works.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.900]   I mean, that's pretty brilliant.
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:59.020]   - So I removed the lifesavers that I had, and I just went in the water.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.380]   My mom said before she could do anything, I was under.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.240]   And it was like a natural thing.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.020]   And for me, I felt immediately at home.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:12.220]   And you know, as little as I was, completely.
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:14.300]   And it goes beyond that.
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:22.820]   You know, this sense of connectiveness or oneness or whatever, I always felt good underwater.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.020]   So it doesn't matter really if it's 20,000 feet.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.320]   The thing that matters at that point is that you need to get there.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:38.220]   So you need to get with all the gears, with your hiking, trekking equipment, high mountaineering
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:39.300]   gears.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:44.660]   And when you get on top of that, you have to remove all that and don a suit.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:49.100]   - Is there something you can speak to the challenging aspects of that process?
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:53.420]   Or is it just like this rigorous process that's well-designed, you have to go through, and
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:55.740]   you don't think one step at a time?
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:27:03.600]   - This is where most of the risk is, because you can be well-prepared, but for one reason
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.200]   or another, you get sick, you know?
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:09.620]   And you can get sick not only because of high altitude sickness.
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:12.300]   It can be a number of things.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:15.540]   Or you can be tired, or you can catch a cold.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:18.080]   And then of course you have the mountain itself.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:24.600]   We had a magnitude 7.8 earthquake hitting one day when we were 50 meters away from the
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600]   summit.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.880]   - You can't obviously plan for that.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.880]   - No, you can't.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.080]   And that's the acts of God.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:36.040]   You know, working with NASA, although I am the director of the SETI Institute, my grants
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.720]   are coming from NASA, so I'm a NASA contractor.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.760]   And every time we go to those environments, we have to go through the rigorous process
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.300]   of training with NASA and checking all the boxes for safety.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.440]   So they are training and training and training us.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.560]   And I have to thank them, because a lot of those trainings are the things that are in
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.420]   your brain when these kind of things happen.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:00.680]   You know how to react, and you are not freaking out.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.600]   But in all of the things they are training us for, you have the green risk, the yellow
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.480]   risk, and the red risk.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   So the green risks are basically the don't be stupid, and don't do the kind of thing
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:16.340]   you wouldn't be doing at home, like jumping on rocks that are not stable.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:19.680]   You can tweak your ankle, you know?
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.340]   And then you have other risks, like high altitude sickness.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:26.320]   How you prepare for that, how you recognize that.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.420]   These are the yellow risks.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.600]   And then the red risks.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:34.320]   The red risks are what they call the acts of gods, the kind of thing that they can happen,
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.520]   you know there is nothing you can do about it, and you accept that when you do that.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:45.760]   So those are volcanic eruptions, when you're in this kind of environment, earthquakes,
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.720]   and everything that, and avalanches, for instance.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.160]   So you're on this giant mountain, and it's shaking.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.760]   No, it's not shaking.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.560]   That's the interesting part of it.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.600]   There was a whole background of things that happened that day when we started off.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:07.440]   But we got to 50 meters from the summit, and I have part of my logistics team that is at
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.120]   the foot of the mountain.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.900]   And being so close to the summit, we have to go under an overhang of lava.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:20.560]   So it's just like we are just under this big vault of lava, and it's actually beautiful.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:25.040]   If you want something beautiful, it's the Altiplano seen from 20,000 feet.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   It's just absolutely stunning.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040]   What's the colors?
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040]   What are we looking at?
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:32.920]   The colors are that of early Earth, which means primordial Earth.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:40.620]   It's ochres, yellows, oranges, browns, with a dark blue sky.
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:43.360]   And so you are just, you know, it's a time machine.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.440]   You're just out there, and you're climbing 42 degree slopes.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:53.840]   So all of a sudden, I'm right next behind the guide, and the guide has been with us,
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:57.040]   his family, you know, we've been together for 10 years.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.240]   And he's starting to do that.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.880]   I don't discuss.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:07.360]   When Macario does that, you know, I listen, and I ask the team to do the same thing, where
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.240]   maybe half a dozen.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.400]   And then I want to talk to him and say, "What's going on?"
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.040]   He's on the radio.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.800]   And then he gives me the radio.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.720]   I'm talking to my logistics chief officer, who was at the bottom, and he said, "We're
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.960]   having a tremendous earthquake."
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:25.480]   He was saying that the, actually the ground was waving.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.320]   It was so bad.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:33.360]   And he was freaking out because he said, "Everything is avalanching, and I'm very puzzled because
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.960]   we are in a very dangerous part of the volcano.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.960]   Nothing's happening."
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:42.800]   I turn around, and then this is when I realized there is dust absolutely everywhere.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   Everything that I saw two minutes before, it's gone, just disappearing into a wall of
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:47.840]   dust.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.280]   But nothing's happening where we are.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:56.200]   And our friends down, they were freaking out because they were seeing everything avalanching,
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.760]   and especially the other side of the mountain we were on was avalanching.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.760]   So they have no visuals.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.000]   They have no visual.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.240]   They thought that we are caught in the avalanching.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.200]   So I said, "No."
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.800]   But some, so at that point, I said-
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.520]   So they thought you were screwed.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:19.120]   So I said, "Okay, so if this is what's happening, then I'm taking everybody to the summit because
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   we have a very large crater that will take care of avalanching.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.560]   We'll be safe.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.280]   And I'm waiting for the aftershock because this is what you do, you know, when you have
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.680]   earthquakes."
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.200]   So here we go, taking everybody in the crater.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:39.880]   And now you have half a dozen scientists in the crater with the crater lake, and this
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.760]   is why we came for.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.960]   So we just had a 7.8 earthquake.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:45.960]   And what do you think they do?
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.680]   Well, of course, they do the science they came to do.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:56.240]   So the only thing is that I couldn't because my radio was only working when I was on the
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.120]   rim of the crater.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:03.840]   But I had a little assistant with me, a young Bolivian teenager.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.080]   He had been shadowing me for three weeks, so he knew exactly what to do.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.040]   And he said, "Natalie, no problem.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:11.040]   Give me your bag.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.280]   I'll do the sampling for you."
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.720]   So I was monitoring the situation.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:21.360]   And I wasn't at that point.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.120]   And there was another moment.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.680]   My friend downstairs, I could, you know...
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.680]   At the foot.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680]   At the foot, yeah.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.680]   We've known each other.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.680]   As I said, we're family.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:31.680]   This team is family.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.680]   We've known each other.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:37.280]   I am the godmother of kids, so we are close.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:44.200]   And I could feel for the first time in my life that he actually was scared.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:48.120]   And he was calling me every 30 seconds, telling me stuff.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.040]   I said, "You have to stop this now.
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:55.960]   Just call me to give me information that is useful for me to make decisions."
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.960]   And so I said, "Okay, what's going on?"
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   All right.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:04.440]   He tells me, you know, there is still avalanching, etc.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:08.120]   And then a few minutes later, he calls me, he says, "I think that Lascar is erupting.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:11.400]   So now I have to tell you, we are on a volcano.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.960]   The next volcano, we share a slope with it.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:20.320]   It's a little lower, but that's the most temperamental volcano of the entire chain.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.760]   And this one has a history of eruption."
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.400]   And then my friend is telling me that the volcano seems to be starting to erupt.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.880]   If that volcano goes up, we have nowhere to go.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.840]   That got my attention.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:40.360]   So if you say scared, I would say that I got the realization that what that meant.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:45.600]   I went cold for like a fraction of a second, but that meant that just my adrenaline started
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   to kick in.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:51.120]   And it was a very, very strange experience because now you have tunnel vision.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.120]   It's about survival.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:56.840]   And I say, "Okay, now you are going to tell me what I need to know.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.720]   Tell me, what do you see?"
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.440]   He say, "I see smoke."
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.080]   I say, "What kind of smoke?"
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.480]   He say, "It's white."
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.440]   I say, "No big deal.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   That's water vapor."
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.360]   "Okay, where is it going?"
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.800]   "It's going to Argentina."
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.880]   That was the opposite direction of where we are.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:17.760]   I said, "Okay, I'm staying where I am because right now there is no danger."
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.640]   And there was still the issue of the aftershock.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.660]   I didn't want to have the team caught in the gully, in the central gully of the volcano
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.060]   with an avalanche coming at us.
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.760]   So we stayed there.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.040]   And he called me after that and say, "Well, it's still going to Argentina."
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.960]   "Fine, okay."
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:42.080]   And then a little later he calls me and say, "Natalie, things are changing here."
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.760]   I say, "Okay, what's going on?"
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:49.000]   I say, "Well, the cloud is a little yellow."
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.000]   And I was thinking to myself, "Shit."
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.320]   What does it mean when it's yellow?
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.320]   Sulfur.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:04.320]   And when you have sulfur mixed with the water vapor or the water in your lungs, this turns
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.480]   into sulfuric acid.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.160]   Then you're really screwed.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.880]   And I say, "Okay, where is the cloud going?"
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.800]   He said, "The wing is shifting.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.040]   It's coming your direction."
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:20.560]   So yeah, that was a day like that, you know.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:24.360]   And I am talking to him on the radio and I'm turning around.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:31.000]   And as I turn around, I see the cloud starting to pop on the opposite side of the rim.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.960]   So at that time, we had no choice anymore because now you have to figure out what's
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.320]   going to kill you first.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.720]   And so there was the risk or the potential of an avalanche.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.480]   But at least you can see the rocks.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:49.760]   The gas is going to kill you before you can see it.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.360]   So I called everybody back.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.760]   We gather our stuff.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:36:00.000]   I didn't give too much detail, but I say, "It's time to go downhill and fast."
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.680]   So which we did.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.640]   We stopped only when we were at mid-camp.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:10.280]   And then at that point, we saw the cloud just completely covering the summit where we were.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.600]   So we did well to bail out.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:16.840]   But that was 500 meters higher than we were.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:17.840]   So we are safe.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.320]   I was just making sure that it would not go down the slope where we were.
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.320]   We are safe.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:26.200]   We did and just rested for a little while.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.560]   And after that, we descended.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.560]   And it was all on adrenaline.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:33.200]   I can tell you what, I had two of my crew with headaches.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.280]   Part of one of them was because of the altitude.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.600]   We climbed very fast.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.640]   The other one was because of the cloud.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.280]   She was the closest to the cloud when it happened.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   So we descended fast.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.320]   Wow, that was close.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.440]   That was close.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:51.160]   And it's interesting how the human body and mind works because I know that from the moment
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:58.560]   my friend told me that the volcano seemed to be erupting, I was going on adrenaline.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:04.080]   But when we got close to them and I saw him, we were getting close to the cars, I saw him
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.920]   coming towards me.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.080]   And the slope, all of a sudden, all the adrenaline went away.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.300]   I was a mess.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.960]   I had to find the first rock and sit down.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.960]   It was gone.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.960]   I mean-- Fascinating.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.680]   So you just basically physically and mentally collapsed once you saw--
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:23.680]   There was nothing left of me.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:29.200]   I got in the car and I felt in the car as we were heading back towards our camp, I could
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.360]   have passed out.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:35.360]   I really fought back and I'm not the kind of passing out really, you know, easy.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.560]   But there was nothing left.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.200]   I had no energy, no nothing.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:49.480]   It's fabulous how you react and how this is embedded in your brain from eons of evolution,
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:55.080]   of reaction to a dangerous situation, basically.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.640]   The drive to survive.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.400]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:01.000]   You just told us one heck of a story.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.400]   And as you said, such story comes along with many of the diving expeditions that you do.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:14.520]   But on the science side, what is that world that simulates, that travels back in time
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.080]   into the Martian landscape?
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.040]   What does the science reveal?
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:24.280]   So the science reveals that life is resilient.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.360]   When I started that project, I told my husband, I said, "This is going to be very fast.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.960]   We are going in such nasty environment that we're not going to find anything.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.920]   And we'll be back home fairly soon."
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.280]   So 20 years later, we are still studying those environments.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.800]   That was a gut feeling like nothing, not much can possibly survive in those conditions.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:51.560]   The UV environment is so nasty, but there you find the same microorganism that made
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.720]   the very first fossils on earth 3.5 billion years ago.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.040]   And they keep surviving.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:04.000]   They developed an adaptation, Swiss army knife, if you prefer.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.760]   And so you learn about that.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:12.520]   You learn about what they are, how they adapt through times and through environmental changes,
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.560]   which is really important.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.920]   What are their signatures?
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.760]   We learn to recognize them.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:23.600]   We learn what kind of instrument we need, what kind of signature, whether it's chemical
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:27.120]   or morphological or whatnot.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.720]   So basically we learn how to explore.
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:34.640]   But I would say that to me, and this is a realization, interestingly enough, that came
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:43.480]   three years into the project, I really woke up literally one morning saying, "We've
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:50.320]   been coming here for three years now, trying to understand how to search for life on Mars.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.520]   But what this place is showing us is what's happening right here, right now on our own
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.800]   planet."
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.620]   And by exploring those extreme environments, we are also reaching to places not too many
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.320]   people go.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:09.880]   And so we are learning more about our own biospheres and the diversity of our own life
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.160]   here on Earth.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.560]   So these are the two main thing that I would say.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.000]   - What kind of life survives up there?
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.800]   - On top of those volcanoes, it's about bacteria, mostly.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.960]   - Is there something specific about that bacteria that's able to be so rugged?
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:28.960]   - Yes.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.680]   They have adapted to very high UV radiation, and it's not only because they are at high
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:39.500]   altitude, it's because early Earth didn't have an ozone layer.
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:48.040]   So when the ancestors of those bacteria originated, they had to survive a world where you had
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:54.160]   lots of short UV coming down at the surface, and also lots of hydrothermal environment,
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.520]   volcanoes and hot water, lots of salt.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:05.240]   And you see all this toolbox still embedded in those microorganisms today, four billion
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.240]   years later.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.000]   It's just amazing.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.920]   And depending on the environment, they are going to switch some of these defenses adaptation
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.120]   on or off.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:25.160]   The UV situation there is so nasty that here you have bacteria like that.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.200]   I know bacteria, you find them everywhere.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.640]   That's really something you find all over the place.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:36.440]   But if you find them here in California, they will turn their protection against UV during
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:42.560]   the day in summer, and they will switch it off at the end of the day.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.640]   There in the Andes, it's so nasty that that thing stays on all the time.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:55.680]   But if you take samples and bring them back here and start to culture them, like we did
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:03.040]   on top of a building, leaving them, you will see the second generation of this organism,
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.520]   they are starting to switch on and off again.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:13.640]   So they're extremely adaptable, extremely rugged, and that's why they are still here.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:18.560]   And probably that's why we're here, because life finds ways.
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:25.800]   Is there some degree to which the harshness of the conditions enables the flourishing
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.520]   of life versus shuts it down?
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.080]   Well, it will shut down those that cannot survive.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:38.400]   Obviously, this is a statement that's kept in obvious right there, but it's also the
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.600]   survival of the fittest.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:43.800]   And this is what evolution is, right?
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:48.560]   So they are here because they were the most adaptable.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:57.080]   And so evolution is going to show the path of the fittest.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   The one that cannot resist, they might have a good time for a little while, but then...
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:08.520]   We've seen this at much different scale and with complex life.
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:15.080]   Not so long ago, a hundred thousand years ago, Neanderthal was side by side by Homo
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:22.520]   sapiens, but Neanderthal was completely adapted to a cold earth, to a glacial earth of the
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.720]   end of the Pleistocene.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:28.200]   And when conditions change, it couldn't last.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.800]   You think, I mean, there's still some mysteries around that, right?
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.800]   Like exactly what were the harshness of the conditions?
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:37.760]   I still really suspicious.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:38.760]   What did Homo sapiens do?
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:39.760]   No, no, no, no.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:40.760]   I really want to know.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:41.760]   No, no.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:43.640]   Some shady stuff that happened.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.640]   Shady stuff happened.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:49.120]   They met, they bred together, they fought against each other.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.120]   What humans do.
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:51.440]   You had to expect that.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:58.440]   But the thing is that Neanderthal was completely adapted for a very long time to live at the
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.840]   edge of those glaciers.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:09.040]   We're probably in a weakened situation when Homo sapiens came and started to spread.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:13.600]   So basically this is what life does.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:19.600]   It adapts and if it cannot adapt anymore, it disappears and something else takes over.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.760]   You hold the women's world record for diving at altitudes, both scuba and free diving.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.080]   So I have to ask, can you describe the details of those records?
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.280]   I never looked for those.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.320]   I'm not after records at all.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:38.600]   In fact, I didn't know I had broken those records when that happened.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.960]   We did that as part of our expedition, our scientific expedition.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.000]   So it's basically sport in the name of science versus...
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.920]   No, it's science in the name of science.
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:50.760]   And it's just a very physical thing that you have to do.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.120]   So we trained ourselves like athletes.
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.200]   To get the job done.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.400]   To get the job done.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.480]   You're holding your breath underwater for a very long time, like with free diving.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.320]   What are we talking about?
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.200]   Do you think in terms of time?
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.640]   Is there like layers where you know through training you're in a good place?
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.560]   Like I'm sure you take time off and you get rusty.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.560]   Right?
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.560]   Yes.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.840]   And I have not been diving in a while, so probably I need to go back to the drawing
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.600]   board at the bottom of the swimming pool.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.560]   But having training from the past, I think, you know, it will pick up much more faster
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.560]   then.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:31.520]   Basically, I would never at those altitude, I would never go over three minutes.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.440]   That would be suicidal.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.360]   So the altitude is much tougher than the pool back at ground level.
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.840]   It is, but it's not...
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.960]   Oh, it's because when you come up and you have to get the oxygen.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.520]   That's not the going in the water.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.300]   When I'm underwater, I'm fine.
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:49.480]   And if I wanted, I could stay longer, but you wouldn't be very wise.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:54.080]   You've written about the history of life on Mars.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:59.960]   Like you said, you're kind of exploring that by looking at the lakes here.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:02.800]   Do you think there's been life on Mars?
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.640]   Do you think there is life on Mars?
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.640]   Right.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:11.080]   So when you're looking at the environment of Mars early on, it's fairly similar to that
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:12.660]   of early Earth.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:17.560]   Never was exactly the same because Mars was always farther from the sun than the Earth.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.560]   Right?
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:24.840]   So it's always a little cooler, but you have to imagine maybe the Arctic during the summer.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:30.220]   That would be early Mars with a lot going on for it in terms of environment.
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:33.520]   Very favorable to even life as we know it.
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:39.920]   So we don't know how fast life happened on Earth.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:45.320]   There are signs right now showing that it might have actually originated only 200 million
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.600]   years after the crust cooled down.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.600]   Wow.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:51.520]   This still has to be verified, but that's the closest.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:57.960]   And these are indirect evidence like carbon left by the activity of life, not life itself.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:05.200]   And there is a twist in the story for Mars is that it seems that Mars came together as
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:12.180]   a planet faster than the Earth and had water earlier than the Earth.
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:20.920]   So it may be that Mars was habitable and might have seen the beginning of life earlier than
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.960]   the Earth.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.640]   So all of this is speculation.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:30.000]   Obviously we haven't found any evidence or solid evidence yet.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.720]   I would say unambiguous evidence, but unambiguous evidence of life is going to be something
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:41.000]   interesting to prove because we don't know what life is, remember.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.760]   So I always joke that the only way we would know that there is life on Mars if there was
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:51.920]   a rabbit jumping in front of the rover, but we might be gathering, we have what we call
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:58.760]   a ladder of life detection, which is that you have a series of rungs that you need to
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:08.600]   go through that actually are not proving you that you discovered life, but are making the
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:17.000]   possibility that what you discovered was made only by the environment more and more improbable.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.040]   So we are trying to prove the contrary, right?
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.480]   So this is what we have right now.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.440]   And as far as I'm concerned, considering all the unknowns we have, I think there was as
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:33.120]   much chance that life originated on Mars than it did on Earth.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:40.200]   And if it was at the surface, then it got in trouble after 500 million years because
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:45.360]   of the disappearance of the magnetosphere, the loss of the magnetosphere and the atmosphere.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.400]   But as we know, life doesn't only stay in one place.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:58.240]   As soon as it's out there, it's going to adapt, it's going to give itself more chance to survive.
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:06.160]   And that to me means that if life appeared, I would say it's still there and probably
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.420]   on the ground where it can be in an environment that's more stable.
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:15.200]   So I don't know how stability is good or not, it might not be so good, but they might be
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:21.680]   in a different type of metabolism through dormancy, waiting for different climate cycles.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:29.340]   And there is the fact that Mars changes a lot faster than the Earth and climate changes
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.940]   are a lot stronger in magnitude.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:36.920]   So there might be a place on Mars, we know that there is a place on Mars deeper in the
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:42.120]   subsurface where temperature and pressure are good for liquid water to stay there.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:45.960]   So these would be good places for a stable habitat over time, no matter what happens
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.040]   at the surface.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:58.640]   But if life is also caught between that deep zone and the surface, there is an active layer,
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:01.440]   there is a lot of ice in the subsurface of Mars.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:08.660]   And when the climate changes, when the obliquity goes beyond 30 degrees, then at that point,
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:12.580]   you will have some activation of that zone.
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:20.220]   You have thawing of the ice, so all this region is reactivated and maybe that's a way where
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:26.780]   you have pathways for life to move from the deep zone to closer to the surface.
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:33.220]   This is why I am one of those scientists who thinks that life might not be so far from
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:35.980]   the surface than we think.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:38.660]   So we don't have to dig very far to find it.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.660]   We probably won't.
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:40.660]   And the reason I'm--
[01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:42.100]   That would be so amazing.
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:47.860]   I am thinking of that just because of this experience as well of extreme environments.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:52.180]   You know, you have to sit and look and listen, basically.
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:56.780]   The story of my life, if I want to understand where microbes are located on Mars, I have
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:58.260]   to become the microbe, right?
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:00.180]   This is the thought experiment.
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:04.100]   And if I want to understand where ET is, then I have to become ET.
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:05.940]   So it's a big stretch.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:12.860]   But in extreme environment, you sit in the desert for a while and you just, you know,
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:17.500]   try to understand where the wind's coming from, where the humidity, when it's showing
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:21.220]   up, and then you start to understand the patterns of those things.
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:24.500]   What are the useful signals that you need for survival?
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:29.600]   You need to know where water is, where the source of energy is going to be drawn from.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.120]   You need to find shelters.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:35.860]   And shelters don't mean that, for instance, you can have a water column of a lake or a
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.500]   river or whatnot, or the ocean.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:43.340]   It can be also a very thin layer of dust.
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:47.140]   Or it can be a translucent rock.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.020]   And you see what we call endoliths.
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:52.660]   These are the same cyanobacteria, but a different version of them.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:57.900]   They live inside the rocks, inside those crystals, because they have the best of life.
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:05.020]   They are into translucent crystals so that they receive the light from the sun.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:07.740]   They can do the photosynthesis.
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:14.980]   But there is enough of that crystal so that the nasty UV is being stopped.
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:19.420]   And they are in their little house.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:25.940]   And when you are looking at temperature within those rocks, they tend to make it toastier
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:27.520]   than the outside temperature.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.640]   So there is a lot of things going on.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:35.860]   So what I'm saying for Mars is that, yeah, right now you don't have an atmosphere very
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:36.860]   much.
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:38.860]   160 times thinner than the Earth.
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:43.840]   6 millibars is really not much, but it's there.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:50.100]   But you still have a lot of short UV, like the nasty ones, UVA, UVB, UVC, that can really
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:55.060]   mess up your DNA and destroy it beyond repair.
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:53:03.600]   But as soon as you have a little alcove into a rock or a cliff, I'd be looking at those
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.600]   places.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:09.240]   But you have to understand Mars, or any other planet for that matter, at the level that
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:11.200]   matters for the microbe.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.480]   And so then you need--
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:16.160]   Be one with the microbe.
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:21.760]   Be one with the microbes, which means that we have lots of orbital data, which is good
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:26.920]   to understand habitability at the planet level or at the regional level.
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:34.160]   But we have very little data right now that is very useful to understand habitability
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:37.440]   at the scale that matters for the microbes at this point in time.
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.160]   So we need to do a better job with that.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:47.880]   My idea is to have arrays of environmental stations that could have a lot of benefits.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.960]   One would be to give us that vision for the microbes.
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.160]   That would be good for us through biology.
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.160]   And second--
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.360]   A collection of stations on Mars.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.360]   On Mars, yeah.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:01.280]   That give us a good map of the planet.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:02.560]   High resolution.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:04.460]   We can do that regionally.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:07.640]   And on top of that, so that's good for us through biology, for the search for life on
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:08.760]   Mars.
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:14.560]   That's good about how to learn where microbes could be that can be a problem for contamination
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.400]   both ways.
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.240]   So that's good for planetary protection.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:26.040]   And since those stations would have communication capabilities on them, that's excellent for
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:30.960]   human exploration because not only you have weather stations all over the place that can
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.320]   tell your astronauts, you know, learn the pattern when it's a good time to go out or
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:41.600]   not go out, and also help them communicate when they go and do sorties.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.760]   So there are a number of things we can do that can tell you lots of information.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.160]   Let's rewind the clock a little bit.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.160]   You grew up in Paris.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.520]   I was just there.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.680]   Helen McDonald in her New York Times amazing profile piece of you writes that your teenage
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:58.960]   years were troubled.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.880]   So how did the challenging early years make the human being the scientist that you are
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:05.880]   today?
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.880]   Everything.
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:14.880]   I think that this is what's taking me on top of those big mountains.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:20.880]   And the irony is for me to be looking for the origin and nature of life because I was
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.720]   so close to losing it.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:27.080]   But to me that was a great lesson learned.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:32.840]   And that helped me see through the beauty of life.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:39.400]   Going on the other side of that, it became really what made me and helped me go through
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:43.120]   absolutely everything and anything in life.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.480]   Climb mountains and tell me there is something I want to know.
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:56.120]   And I am going to give it my best and I won't give up and I won't give in.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:03.920]   And this is a message that I carried all my life and I'm so very grateful that I did because
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:07.200]   all the things that I would have missed if I hadn't done that.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.500]   You know, this is something that I wrote in my first book and part of it is the reason
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.120]   why I wrote it.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:19.040]   Just because I felt that there were messages in my path.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.520]   Oftentimes teenagers are troubled.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.760]   It can be one way or another.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:26.880]   Or if it's not a troubled teenage, you have times in your life where you doubt, where
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.000]   you know, you're just waving your arm and say, "What's the purpose?
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.680]   What's the reason why I carry on?"
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:40.560]   And when I see all the things that I'm doing, the dream that I was able to fulfill, what
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.520]   a waste it would have been, you know?
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:48.640]   So there was a point in your life where you thought about suicide?
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:50.160]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:54.520]   I did more than thinking about it, but I was a lucky one.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:55.720]   For some reason I'm still here.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.720]   I still don't know why, but I'm still here.
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:05.000]   And the lesson for me was that never ever again, because you have to give tomorrow a
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000]   chance.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.280]   You never can think about tomorrow in the terms of the present.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.500]   You never know what can happen.
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:18.200]   You know what is going to happen if you go through what you want to do.
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.080]   Tomorrow's never happening, you know?
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:27.040]   And I had the other lesson came a few years later, where actually somebody was drowning
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.960]   and I went after that person.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:33.200]   I almost died that day too, not that I wanted to, but it's just because the condition were
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.760]   very, very difficult.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:41.280]   That person died from there, although we took him out of the water.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:44.200]   But I had a lot of difficulty coming out.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.360]   I came out, but then I thought a lot about that guy.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.560]   He was in his 30s.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:56.360]   And it was like a sort of a echo from a few years before telling me that person would
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:58.560]   never have a tomorrow.
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:04.280]   That person would never be able to fulfill his dream or even have dreams of any kind.
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:09.040]   And I was here and I was going to give myself the best chance to fulfill all the dreams
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.700]   I wanted to and go after all the questions I wanted to.
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:15.800]   And this is what kept me going now, you know?
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:22.520]   So the advice there is even if you don't see a why, an answer to the why question, why
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:23.520]   live today?
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:29.200]   Give tomorrow a chance, always.
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:32.640]   Do you think about your death today?
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:37.200]   Do you think about your mortality?
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:38.200]   Not really.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:40.840]   You've been so close with it so many times.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.960]   Yeah, that's part of life.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:48.240]   And you know what, if something happens to me while I'm doing the stuff I love, what
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.320]   a way of going.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:54.000]   This will happen wherever it catches me.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000]   I don't know.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.080]   I don't care.
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:57.720]   It will be what it will be.
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:01.640]   And I had the best of all masters for that.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:03.160]   I had my husband.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.400]   My husband and I were 44 years apart in age.
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:10.880]   And it was just a pure love story.
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:18.960]   And he never looked at his age, never thought about himself or defined himself by his age.
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:23.640]   In fact, he reinvented life for himself at an age where everybody retires.
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:26.160]   We met when he was 66.
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:31.200]   And that was a blessing and a curse, but a blessing most of it, because we took every
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.840]   single day as if it was the last.
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:36.080]   So we enjoyed life.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:40.160]   And right now, it's not so much.
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.200]   I have to really think of him.
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:46.760]   He just passed away this August, last August.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:57.520]   And for me, it's more like I have to draw from his example, on him always telling me,
[01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:05.280]   look forward, trust life, be happy, live.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.280]   Every day, every single day, I have to remind several times a day of this.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.840]   It's not easy.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.640]   But he had the recipe.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:17.920]   He never thought about death, because when you start thinking too much about death, that
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:21.680]   prevents you from living.
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.680]   Do you miss him?
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:24.760]   Oh, gosh, we were so close.
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:29.960]   I think we were, it's more like one spirit in two bodies.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.200]   We were that close.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:34.280]   So missing him doesn't even cut it.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:42.000]   I mean, it's the toughest mountain I ever climbed.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.440]   What's the role of love in the human condition?
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.720]   I think, I hope, that this is the force that drives the universe.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:55.560]   Although we might be experiencing the other side of it, maybe just to learn how important
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.160]   love is.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:00.560]   That might be it.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:09.400]   For me, my experience with my husband, where I never had to wake up every single morning
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:16.520]   ever wondering if I was loved, I had to look in his eyes and him looking back at me to
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.120]   know it.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:24.760]   So when you get to that point where you don't question it anymore, I would hope for humanity
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:31.200]   to reach that point where you can feel the same love for the person that is unknown in
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.760]   the street, that you feel for the people you love.
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:39.840]   I think that at that point we are going to be reaching the maturity of that civilization
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.220]   we are hoping for.
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:51.000]   And seeing the universe through love, that doesn't run spacecrafts, of course, but putting
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:57.860]   love into our intent of going into and settling into another planet instead of, "Oh my God,
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:04.080]   we need to escape because we are freaking messing up with our own planet."
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:10.040]   I think that this is the answer to so many things.
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:17.840]   Is there a part of you that maybe just a little bit wants to step foot on Mars, like you personally?
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.240]   Oh yeah, of course.
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:20.240]   I'm curious.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:23.640]   I'm a scientist and I've been working on Mars.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:28.480]   I was actually privileged to be working on Gusev Crater and deciding for the landing
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:33.560]   site of the Spirit rover, which means that I worked on that landing site for 15 years
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.960]   and I got to see it from the ground.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.520]   That's the closest to being there and exploring.
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.000]   Of course, that's not physically being present there.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.160]   If you were giving me the opportunity, of course I would go, but I know one thing, I
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:52.120]   would want to come back.
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:03:01.000]   So given the option of dying on Mars or dying on Earth, you'd visit Mars, but you would
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.640]   like to spend your last days here.
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:05.640]   Yeah, because of a number of things.
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:11.840]   I think that first, we're not ready to set on Mars, regardless of what being said.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.720]   It will happen.
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.560]   It will happen and because we are explorers, humans, you know, they're explorers.
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:20.840]   So this will happen and it's a good thing.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:24.880]   Depending on how we go about this, it can be a very good thing.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:29.440]   You know, with time, as much as I've been exploring, continue to explore the big questions
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:35.920]   of origin and nature of life or exploring of a planet, the love, you were talking about
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:44.320]   love, the love for my own planet has grown deeper and my concern about it has grown deeper.
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:50.320]   So the data that I'm collecting to learn about other planets, I'm also using it to understand
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:56.400]   better our home planet and trying to make it a little better for the next generation.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:02.800]   So if you were talking about love, this is love that would drive me back here.
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:10.320]   Yeah, this planet, it's just sometimes I just pause and I'm in awe at the incredible thing
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:18.600]   we have here and just I have deep gratitude for all the life forms here, the beautiful
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:19.600]   complexity.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:25.320]   Of course, there's darkness behind it, all the death, all the extinction that led up
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:29.000]   to us two descendants of apes sitting here today.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.560]   I feel that's a responsibility.
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:33.960]   We're the fittest that survived.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:43.160]   You're right, as the dominant species, at least, technologically, et cetera, maybe not
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.920]   the wisest one, but the dominant species, we have a responsibility towards the entire
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:56.360]   biosphere because the decisions we're making now not only affect us, they're affecting
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:58.000]   the entire biosphere.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:03.640]   And right now, the choices we are making are leading to the disappearance of 150 species
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:05.960]   every single day.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:13.640]   All the big mammals on this earth today are on the brink of extinction.
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:18.520]   We are within the sixth greatest extinction.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:21.640]   It's unfolding before our eyes.
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:33.220]   And I would strongly suggest that we use our smart to help a little bit this situation.
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:34.320]   And we can do this.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:35.840]   I think we can do this.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:41.520]   We just need to redirect our energy.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:43.800]   - In the name of love.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.360]   This was an incredible conversation.
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:47.720]   I'm really honored that you sit with me.
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:51.960]   I've been a fan of your work for a long time now, so this is really awesome.
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:52.960]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:53.960]   - You're very welcome.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:54.960]   Thanks.
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:58.280]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nathalie Cabral.

[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:07.200]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Stanislav Lem and Solaris.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:13.680]   How do you expect to communicate with the ocean when we can't even understand one another?
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.800]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:16.300]   [END]
