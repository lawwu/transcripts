[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.800]   our distinguished guest of honor is the founder of the Vanguard Group and president of Vanguard's
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.240]   Bogle Financial Markets Research Center. He created Vanguard in 1974 and served as chairman
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.960]   until 2000. He entered the investment field immediately following his graduation from
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.000]   Princeton University Magna Cum Laude with a degree in economics in 1951. If I listed
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.360]   all of his honors and achievements, which most of you already know, we wouldn't have
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.720]   any time left. So I'll dispense with that and ask you to please welcome our very special
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   guest of honor, Mr. Jack Bogle.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.600]   Is it ever enough? I wrote a book about that. Thank you all so very much. It's great to
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.840]   see some very familiar faces here that I've been seeing for years and years and years.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.080]   I appreciate that, even as I wonder why you keep coming back. But it's nice. And I hope
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.160]   you, those of you, about half of you, I think, who are joining us for the first time, will
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.560]   get the same kind of enjoyment that your fellow Bogleheads have gotten.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.360]   I've already spoiled my opening, which is to say, the first thing I want to say is Taylor
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.760]   Laramore. He's our founder of the Bogleheads, a wonderful human being. He can't be with
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.560]   us this year. He was with us last year. But he is the creator of this crazy idea and even
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.400]   the namer of it, which is a little odd. What does a Boglehead, people say to me? I'm not
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   sure yet. But they're nice people, that's for sure.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.240]   The second word was going to be, divided by two, a tie, was going to be Emily Snyder,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.320]   my wonderful assistant of 26 years, been at Vanguard for 32. I know she did not join us
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:43.040]   when she was one, but you'll see her over there. She still has all the energy of a schoolgirl
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.160]   and couldn't do my job without her. And a close tie, we have Michael Nolan, who's kind
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.400]   of a short-termer at Vanguard, only 10 1/2 years, 16 1/2 years, excuse me, and he's been
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.960]   with me a little over six. If you think there are too many slides, blame him, although I'm
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.840]   the one that deserves the blame. Is that fair, Mike?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   Fair enough.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.420]   And Mike has been a wonderful asset to me. And the three of us constitute the powerful
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.240]   Bogle Financial Markets Research Center. And my God, we crank out a lot of stuff.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:25.600]   So we'll go to the first slide. It's going to set the stage for this. A couple of comments
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.560]   about my year, I guess, and my career. Larry Siegel is the CFA's Director of Research,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.040]   Chartered Financial Analyst. And he wrote quite an article. We're going to send it out
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.720]   one of these days. And he calls me, which is a nice reward for what I've done, the most
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.560]   visible advocate of indexing investing as a winning strategy. And I think that's accurate.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.400]   I'm not sure this one is accurate, but I sure loved it. Henry Ford of the automobile, Shakespeare
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.480]   of the English language, Bogle of finance. Well, that's all right. Bill, step it up a
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.080]   little bit for your next blurb, will you? You can do better.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:13.360]   And I wouldn't have the temerity, I guess is the word, to give you the other blurbs
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.720]   in the back of the book. But they're not quite that great. I keep wondering who they're talking
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:31.240]   about. In any event, once in a while, I think about my legacy. I do, with apologies. And
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.040]   my place in history, such as it may be. And on these two scores, this has been a really
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.560]   remarkable year. I just have two slides that will give you the remarkability when you get
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.600]   into history and impact. First is this cartoon in the Wall Street Journal. And if you can't
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.440]   read the caption, it's Jason Zweig in the front left. You know who-- well, let's go
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:04.960]   around the other way. Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Graham, Sir Isaac Newton-- I mean, really--
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.120]   Danny Kahneman, Princeton guy, Aristotle-- we could do better than that-- Charlie Munger
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.800]   and Warren Buffet, and then yours truly.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:26.760]   And so it's a matter of, to me-- I'll get to a business thing in a minute. But I really
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.840]   like the intellectual side of what I do every day, at least as much and maybe even more
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.040]   than the business side. I don't consider myself much of a businessman. But I do try and keep
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.280]   it. I'm not as smart as him. I'm the dumbest guy at that table, I'm sure. But I still value
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:53.040]   a place that puts me in the context of thought and wisdom.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.320]   And I also value-- if you want to flip that to the next one-- the only other slide I have
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.600]   for background-- who was the father of passive investing? Well, it turns out the answer to
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:10.480]   that-- I'm glad you're all sitting down-- is me. So that was a nice thing to read in
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.360]   the Wall Street Journal. And that is a role that I would like to be known for in life.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.840]   I think it's true. There are a lot of claimants to that, particularly to Throne. But it's
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.120]   a nice compliment. And it made me feel very good when I saw that there.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:35.320]   So we'll now go to getting the boost. How did we get here? How did we get to that name
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:45.280]   and reputation? And the first one can be pretty obvious. The second possible highest source
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:52.160]   for getting a boost for me is-- I want to be clear-- it is someone who is up there who
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.800]   ranks far above me. But other than that, the second possible source is our friend Warren
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.480]   Buffett. And I'm going to give you a few quotes from him. He's been champion index fund for
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:10.120]   a long time. "Indexers are sure to beat the net results after fees delivered by the great
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.560]   majority of investment professionals." And that goes all the way back to 1996. That's
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.280]   20 years ago, 21 years ago. Somewhere along the way-- or actually, in 1991, I met Warren
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.560]   Buffett for the first time. We were sitting in the lobby of a hotel in San Diego, California,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.520]   where I was there to lecture the state securities commissions. And he was there to persuade
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.480]   California to let Salomon Brothers, which was about to go bankrupt, still do business
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.200]   out there. And we were both up early. We were both in the lobby there, knowing nobody else.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.440]   So I made so bold as to go and pay my respects to him and said I didn't want to bother him,
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.560]   just wanted to meet him. And we talked for about an hour, mostly about the letters we
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:58.820]   get about how we aren't good dressers. He got one that said, you look like Joes ready
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:08.880]   to wear. So we had that in common. And I guess we went from there. Warren again, 2013. You
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.760]   know about this, his bequest to his wife and the trustees for his wife's bequest, 10% of
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.600]   the cash in short-term governments, 90% in the very low cost 500 index fund. I recommend
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:33.340]   Vanguard's. And it goes on. The hedge fund bet-- a lot more text there than you need.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.840]   But we're going to have these slides available, so I put it all up. And he offered to bet
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:45.920]   in a group he could beat with the S&P 500, a group of five hedge funds. And he challenged
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.360]   people to give him the bet. Well, these hedge fund guys who have billions and billions and
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.160]   billions, well, it's a good business to be in if you're not a client, actually.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:02.320]   And nobody but Ted Sides answered the call, the sound of silence, as Warren says here.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:14.080]   And so the bet is just about over. The funds have delivered a 2.2% return compounded. That's
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:22.400]   a million dollars. Would have gained $220,000. And the index fund was returned with 7.1%.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:30.820]   And that investment would have gained $854,000. That is 4 to 1, roughly.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:36.300]   So the bottom line, as he said in his annual report, when trillions of dollars are managed
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.540]   by Wall Street charging high fees, it will usually be-- usually be, always almost-- the
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:48.860]   managers who reap upside profits and not the clients. Both large investors and small, again,
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.600]   should stick to low-cost index fund.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.500]   So he then goes beyond being the index champion to being the Bogle champion. And I obviously
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:03.940]   enjoy this. He had the famous one last year, famous to Vanguard people, and put up a statue
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.300]   for me. By the way, just for the record, there is a statue of me in our courtyard out there.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.420]   But he had not seen it. But it was a nice thought.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:17.940]   And it's fine to say he had managed-- I'm certainly a wealthy person by any standard.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:23.820]   But he's, in fact, right by the fact that it's only a tiny percentage of wealth that
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.380]   typically goes to managers who have promised their investors large rewards while delivering
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.300]   them nothing.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:37.500]   So he talks about the fact I was mocked by the investment industry. It's very satisfying.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.020]   He does have-- in fact, he does have the satisfaction of knowing that he's helped millions of investors
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.220]   to realize better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.420]   is a hero to them and to me. Can't do any better than that from that high source.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.620]   And then a friend of mine took me out to his annual meeting in Omaha this year. And I'm
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   sitting there with Eve, my wife, Steve Galbraith, who took me out, and his wife, my daughter,
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.540]   and my son-in-law came out, and my youngest son, his young lady, also came out. So we
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:13.740]   were sitting there. And I guess I should have figured something funny was going to go on.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.500]   But all of a sudden, Warren looks up and says, I want to say something about Jack Boat. Are
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.100]   you here in the audience? Yes, I am. And so I stood up and everybody applauded. And they
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:30.940]   took, in the course of those couple of days-- I didn't keep exact count, but I think 725
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:42.980]   photographs, including 190 selfies. And to the point it got Eve a little bothered. But
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:48.900]   she was fine. They were a little aggressive, some of them. So you see all in here, not
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.180]   in the interest. Truth is, it was not in the interest of the investment industry of Wall
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.820]   Street to actually have the development of the index fund, because it brought down fees
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.300]   dramatically. Index funds have delivered for shareholders a result that has been better
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.780]   than Wall Street professionals. And part of the reason for that is down with the cost.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:12.620]   When Jack started, very few people applauded him. He was subject of derision, Vogel's folly
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:18.620]   being one, that's me. A lot of attacks, and it saved investors hundreds and hundreds of
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:26.020]   billions of dollars over time. So it's Jack's 88th birthday. I like this one, on Monday.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:32.100]   So I just say, looking at me, happy birthday, Jack, and thank you on behalf of American
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.060]   investors. And then after a nice roll of applause, he said, Jack, I've got some great news for
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:43.260]   you. You're going to be 88 on Monday in only two years. You will be 90, and you'll be ready
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:53.100]   for an eligible, for an executive position at Berkshire. So he closes his remarks. Hang
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.580]   in there, buddy.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:04.020]   And finally, for Warren, the Vogel champion, is the new book. And the cover says from Warren,
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:12.560]   that's where you put them, rather than, I knew that Chinese red was difficult to read
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:19.660]   with white on it. And you reduce this in size, Mike, you're making it impossible for me.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:26.940]   Rather than listen to the siren song from investment managers, investors, large and
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:34.380]   small, should instead read Jack Vogel's little book of common sense investing. And that's
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.900]   what's on the cover of the little book that's going to be available today, I think.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:48.380]   So it's a pretty priceless endorsement. And modesty precludes, I'm very well known for
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:57.780]   modesty and humility, precludes showing the three other blurbs in the back cover, in addition
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.460]   to Bill Bernstein's, which you saw on the cover.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:10.540]   But I now want to turn, while I'm bragging, forgive me, to one of my main missions today,
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.780]   which is spreading the word. But before, I do want to add that when I say one of my main
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:21.820]   missions, my other main mission, and I have a lot if I thought about it, is to work directly
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:28.300]   with our crew, the 16,000 people at Vanguard, honest to God, human beings, down to earth
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.540]   human beings, all with their own hopes and fears and career goals. And it's hard to do
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.860]   this. It's so easy to do when you have 27 associates, crew members, which is where we
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:45.740]   started, and so difficult to do it when you get to 16,000. So I've just tried to carve
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.660]   out that role. Everybody else is too busy to do it. And spent a lot of time, spent an
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:57.380]   hour for each award for excellence winner. I do probably pretty close to one a week celebrations
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:07.300]   of 25, 30 years of service at Vanguard. We've got quite a few of them now. And retirements,
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:13.580]   which leave us poorer than we were before the person retired. So we have, I think it's
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:21.060]   3,500 crew members who have run my veterans list to get my mailings. And to be on that
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.500]   list, you've got to be with Vanguard for 15 years. So that's a big part of what I do,
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.260]   and it really doesn't serve well. It's not easily illustrated. So I'm now going to go
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:42.220]   to spreading the word and begin with awards. Lots of them in 2017. Number one, I guess
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:51.620]   most recent is the Forbes tabulation of the world's 100 greatest living business minds.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.260]   And unfortunately for Forbes, I should have told them that before. I don't really have
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:16:01.980]   a business mind. I have a mind that is designed to be a missionary, to serve, to understand
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:08.140]   simple math, and if it works out to be good business, that's a nice byproduct. So who
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:14.780]   are these winning business minds? Well, you'll notice them all on the cover. I like the Bs,
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:23.540]   Buffett, Bezos, Bloomberg, and Bogle. Murderers Row, and the other group in those two columns,
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:31.180]   Mark Zuckerberg, Meg Whitman, Rupert Murdoch, Ted Turner, and me are all, I think, in some
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:39.700]   ways legitimate candidates for that. I think that Forbes kind of let us down by leaving
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:50.620]   out as one of their criteria, creating durable value for society. That doesn't seem to be
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.860]   in there, and I've listed some people, not to get too personal, who I'm not sure have
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.140]   created enduring value for society. Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn made all their money
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:08.100]   in casinos, a socially negative thing involving payoffs to regulatory authorities, and that's
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:14.060]   what gets them there, more power to them, I guess. And Donald Trump, I'm not in politics
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.420]   here, but his record as a businessman was cutting off and paying all his suppliers that
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.460]   are putting up the buildings, and stopped paying them, and they have to sue them, and
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:30.140]   they have what they're entitled to. What a great case for a businessman. So I wonder
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.660]   about them. They were all selected. And I will tell you this story about a certain person
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:42.620]   there, because when they were taking the photograph, and I think maybe 45 or 50 of the 100 actually
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:48.140]   showed up at this big party. I was going to have Mike Nolan stand in for somebody for
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:53.980]   the photo, but I said to this young woman, I've always had this attractive young woman
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:18:01.980]   at these things, I know, and I said, "You know, I feel like I'm a little boy with a
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.980]   bunch of giants." And she said, "Oh, Mr. Vogel, I'm sure everybody in the room feels that
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:19.020]   way." And I said, "I'll bet Jack Welch doesn't." His claim to fame is he's created the biggest
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:25.980]   loss of shareholder capital market cap of any businessman in history, $400 billion.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:31.880]   Gee, he's gone down. But he's irrepressible, I'll tell you that. He has a girlfriend, his
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:40.980]   young wife, whatever. So that's another award. Then we get to the icons from Philadelphia
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.900]   Inquirer, or from Investment News, I should say, first. And the other winner was Charles
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.660]   Schwab, who I think probably deserves it. And there were just the two of us, and he
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:55.940]   didn't show up, so I got an extra five minutes to talk, which was nice. And then we had icons
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:04.580]   again here in Philadelphia. Philadelphia Business Hall of Fame, five leaders of impact has stretched
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:10.940]   beyond the city. And there they are. You'll see the fellow over on the left. So that was
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.860]   very nice. Well, I keep thinking, "Icon, isn't that one of those things on your computer
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:22.060]   that you go click?" So maybe that's what it's about. And that resulted in a nice article,
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:29.020]   which you can see quickly here, a nice picture from the Inquirer. And then that was the third
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:37.300]   award. And the fourth one is coming up. And this award, I like the Forbes award, which
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:43.260]   I thought was interesting. And not only the creative idea, but the impact that practical
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:51.460]   application of the idea has made in improving the economic well-being of individuals and
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:57.100]   industry or a nation. And that's the kind of award I would like to win. My wife said
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.060]   I couldn't go to Florida to get it, and I shouldn't have done it anyway. But then they
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:10.420]   said they'd send a plane. We'll just send a plane, that's all. And so we're still negotiating.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.940]   So whether I will have to do it by video, and I kind of like to do it there, because
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.780]   I'm receiving it with Matt McQuown, who was big in the thinking of this product out of
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:27.980]   Wells Fargo. And so I'd like to do it, and I guess that we probably will do it. But I
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.060]   don't travel alone. I don't mean to talk about my weaknesses, but I have trouble getting
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:45.300]   around a lot. And so if Eve doesn't do it, and we have a good time together, don't we,
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.060]   Mike? Absolutely, of course. I like that. Okay, that's enough awards, I think, for the
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:58.180]   moment, for a year. I don't know. For someone who wrote the book called Enough. And so the
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.820]   big part of spreading the word is what I do myself, not what others do for me. And so
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.420]   I include articles, editorials, speeches, and books that I've done, and we'll just review
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.900]   them very quickly. The articles is the cover story. You've probably seen it in Bloomberg
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:18.540]   Markets. And you'll see over on the right that I'm praying for somebody. I don't know
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:26.140]   who that is. You, you. And so it was nice to see the cover story. It was a decent interview.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:32.580]   I probably said a few things I shouldn't have, which is what makes it decent. And then, I
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.900]   mean, there are so many of these articles, I mean, you can't even keep up with them.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.320]   But another one that was particularly nice was from BBC Britain, about 50 Inventions
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:51.340]   that Shaped the Modern Economy. And this is a, it's obviously an index fund. And obviously,
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.420]   I did it. But what happened, this is the text of the article, I'm just going to go through
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:01.860]   a little bit. A practical businessman paid attention to an academic economist's suggestion.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.340]   He then tells the story. What could be simpler and cheaper than an index fund recommended
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.580]   by the world's most expensive, most respected economist? And that would be Paul Samuelson,
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:18.020]   Nobel Laureate. And he says, you've heard this quote, ranks this Bogle invention along
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.500]   with the invention of the wheel. You're right, this is right up here with you, Bill Bernstein.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:28.260]   The alphabet, Gutenberg printing and wine and cheese. And so that may even be better,
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:35.180]   Bill, I don't know. But truly something new under the sun. And Paul Samuelson was a truly
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:41.180]   great man. It's really odd, weird to have him thinking, you know, be in the same room
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:48.980]   with him, because he says intelligence overwhelms you. But he just liked what I was doing, wrote
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:56.260]   columns about it in Newsweek. We got to know each other. He did the introduction to my
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:03.660]   first book, which I don't think I've told you this story before, but I sent Dr. Samuelson
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:12.620]   to me the manuscript for my first book, Bogle and Mutual Funds. And I said, it'd really
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:19.580]   be nice if you could do an endorsement for it. And I get this phone call about two days
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:31.820]   later. John, this is Paul Samuelson. I don't do blurbs anymore. The blurb has been devalued,
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:38.100]   a coin that has been devalued. However, I would like to do the introduction. And when
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:45.660]   I was picked up off the floor, I said, well, can I have a day to think about that? Not
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:53.940]   quite true. So that's, I think, pretty good. Some are around the world now. Millionaire,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:00.140]   German. Bonka, John. That's me. Plugging the books. Is Bill Faloon here? Are we doing business
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.660]   in Germany? I hope so. And then here's the article. Nice article, nice pictures. Meister
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:14.620]   Bogle. I guess that means Mr. Bogle. I don't know. And Article 4 over there is from Japan.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:22.740]   And then Article 5 is American, U.S. Investment Advisors. Is your firm one that Jack Bogle
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:29.620]   would respect? I mean, that's implicitly a high praise, I think. And then ARP. You probably
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:36.980]   have seen this or heard about it. An extensive article with Jack Otter. And ARP, you hear
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.820]   a lot about ARP when something like that comes out. You realize how small most publications
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:51.260]   are in circulation. ARP has 23 million readers. And I've only heard from 22 million of them.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:58.340]   And then there was that great article in the Sunday Times of London. And in case you can't
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:04.300]   recognize me, I'm the one with the dog. Right there. Seems like a long time ago. And there's
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.940]   my beautiful mother, who I think about just about every day. And then The Economist of
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.020]   London, a great place to be. Actually, not so much from a business standpoint. A nice
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:21.600]   article about index funds. And let's see what comes next here. Oh, this is the fun one.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.340]   This is the last article. Somebody sent me Fidelity's Daily Bullet, and they send that
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:34.580]   to investors. And the first thing they say is highlighting an article that's attached.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.020]   The reason Jack Bogle doesn't apply first class says everything you need to know about
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.660]   his investing legacy. Well, that's not bad. They're telling their own customers this.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:52.580]   Are they mad? Did Abby know about it? What did she say? I don't know. But our former
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:58.700]   rival is struggling a bit. They had a very good year this year, by the way, to give them
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.220]   their credit. They'll go back and forth. I just love helping out anybody who needs help
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:11.060]   like Fidelity. And then we had another editorial in the New York Times. This is about the fiduciary
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:20.200]   duty rule and, quote, putting clients second. And that ran early last year, February 9th.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.740]   You've probably seen that. I won't attempt to even-- I mean, they say, why let Wall Street
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.780]   profit at the expense of retirement investors? And that was good. I worked in close coordination
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   because it's a little bit contentious at Vanguard what kind of a position we should take on
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:41.860]   fiduciary duty. I'm strongly in favor. And everybody's in favor of it, intellectually
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.660]   in favor of it. But sometimes the rules-- people think the rules are too tough for things
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:53.900]   of that nature. So that's number one editorial. And number two is Investment News, an article
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:00.900]   by me on fiduciary rule, ready or not, an expanded fiduciary rule is coming. And I like
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:10.780]   the line they put in there that I put in there from a press report that I received. Finally,
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:17.060]   John Bogle goes, the dream of fiduciary standard will come true. And I hope that will be. It's
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.060]   good for everybody except people who have taken too much money out of the system.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:30.620]   And then two more editorials in the Financial Analyst Journal, Balancing Business and Professional
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:35.020]   Values. They asked for 4,000 words. And I gave them 8,000 words and told them they couldn't
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:41.700]   cut it. But I thought it was unusual they would pile on with me to ask me of all people
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.740]   to write an article about the industry, and broader than just the mutual fund industry.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:52.220]   But I had fun doing it, a lot of work. And the result was, I think, good.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:59.180]   And that was my 11th FAJ article. And my 16th Journal of Portfolio Management article was
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:06.380]   called The Road Not Taken. That's the speech I gave at Morningstar. And I should tell you,
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:13.660]   the reason I gave it at Morningstar was that a story in the London Times recommended that
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:20.900]   the ICI, Investment Company Institute, our trade association, that they have just kind
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.740]   of ignored me for all these years. And they said, why don't you tell them you should speak
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:34.340]   at this year's ICI annual meeting? So I wrote in to the head of the ICI. And he didn't write
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:42.180]   back. You don't want anything on the record here. And he said, no. He did say it. He said
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.340]   it in a nice way, Paul Stevens, in a sort of nice way.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.780]   So I immediately picked up the phone and called Morningstar and said, I'd like to give you
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:59.380]   a speech at your regular industry meeting two weeks from now. And they said, that would
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:03.580]   be great. Plenty of room in the schedule for you, even with two weeks. And they gave me
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.860]   a nice slot. And then I told them that I couldn't deliver it in person because I'm just not
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.500]   about to fly to Chicago to do it. So we did it by video. And it was OK. And then we had
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:18.820]   a live Q&A after. And that became The Road Not Taken. It turned into an article for Journal
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:24.900]   of Portfolio Management. This is called multi-tasking.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:31.780]   So writing a lot. I really love this article. I wrote it myself. But it was one of my particular
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:37.260]   favorites. David and Goliath for the FHA. That was in a previous edition. I'm sorry
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:45.140]   for the JPM. And one award for outstanding article on JPM. There's the award. It's huge.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.620]   I wish they'd make it a little smaller because I don't have that much room in my walls anymore.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:54.260]   But I was really proud of that article. And the nice thing about it is you've got a chance
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:00.340]   when you're-- this is my-- what did we say? Was that my third or fourth outstanding?
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:09.020]   Third outstanding article. And that's judged by the readers. And so you get to write a
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.940]   retrospective of it five years later. And that's really fun. I'm writing it right now.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.620]   It's only been out there for two years. And I've got two of them in my-- it's fun to look
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:26.020]   at what you did earlier and critique it, say where you were right, where you were wrong,
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.660]   what you left out, what you might have overemphasized, and so on.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:34.860]   So the writing is a big-- I mean, I write and write and write. And I'm not so sure I'm
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:42.420]   any good, which will bring me to-- whether I'm any good or not-- to the books that I've
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:49.220]   written. And the publication date is right upon us for a 10th anniversary edition of
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:54.180]   Little Book of Common Sense Investing. And its predecessor-- this is the one with the
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:31:03.540]   Buffett blurb-- its predecessor, been the number one bestseller on Amazon almost every
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.660]   day since the publication 10 years ago. I mean, you get little-- every once in a while,
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:17.100]   a daily thing kind of flashes up. And I got a call from Joe DiStefano, the chief financial
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:23.460]   guy at the Philadelphia Inquirer. And he said, you're not number one anymore. So I looked
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:29.100]   myself up. And there, this book has leaped into the number one position. And it was called
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:35.780]   Jackass Investing. So a little flash in the pan there.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:43.780]   And so I said, Joe, check it out tomorrow, would you? And it was gone. So the book is
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:50.220]   short and simple and obviously persuasive. 565 Amazon reviews. That's huge. And with
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:57.580]   an average rating of 4.6. I said it was 4.7. But Mike rounded off 4 point something-- 4.55
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:06.620]   and 4.65, just 4.6. And I rounded it up. And this is the new edition. It's really quite
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.060]   different. And I should tell you this story about whether I'm a good writer. And I went
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:15.300]   over the book, the original edition, preparatory to bring out the new edition, which has quite
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:23.020]   a bit changed. And I thought, what idiot wrote this book? And where was his editor? And I
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:29.660]   was both the idiot and the editor. And it really was not very good. So I tried to make
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.140]   it a little better written, even the stuff that was there. And then I added these chapters
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:39.980]   on asset allocation and on retirement plan investing and on dividends.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.900]   But that little book only begins with the impact. I mean, I couldn't believe this when
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:52.940]   we started to count them all up. 848,000 books, beginning with Bogle on mutual funds, 250,000.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.220]   That's the one that had a new perspective called indexing. And Common Sense on Mutual
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:07.140]   Funds, later edition by David Swenson there, forwarded by David Swenson in 2010. And so
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:17.240]   it sold 102,000 copies. And it's quite amazing, the book enough. I'm pretty sure that when
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.020]   I cork, there'll be a lot of demand for it. And I hope to be over 100,000. And Mike, could
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:26.620]   you cable me up there when we get there?
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.980]   And so I really feel good about the acceptance of these books in the marketplace. And so
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:43.900]   good that the little book updated with book 11. And now we're going to book 12. Is the
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:51.820]   man mad? Yes. And it's going to be kind of a history of Vanguard with some things that
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:59.220]   I've written and haven't been published. And I didn't want a financial kind of title because
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:09.380]   it goes beyond finance. So I took a line, a little couplet by Johnny Cash. The trees
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:16.060]   I planted still are young. The songs I sang will still be sung. Now, I would sing that
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:21.380]   to you, but I only have one note. But I think that my tentative title is going to be the
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.460]   songs I sang will still be sung. And they will be, no question about that.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:35.400]   Now, big year for speeches. It's ridiculous. I mean, look at that list. April 26th, April
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:44.220]   27th, May 23rd, September 24th, October 24th, November 9th, I still got to do that one,
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:49.380]   Puritan Boston, Quaker Philadelphia to the Society of Friends here. Then the Council
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:55.160]   for Foreign Relations, which is the Q&A. That's no work. And then something for the Public
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.780]   Accounting Company Oversight Board in Washington. And that's about it.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:07.060]   But the biggest one was, I think the biggest one, not necessarily the best, was when I
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.300]   got the gold medal of Pennsylvania Society, which meets every year in New York. Don't
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:19.220]   ask me to explain that. They can't even explain it. And they got about 1,500 black tie politicians
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:27.160]   and their brides, and they have a big celebration, and they have to give somebody a gold medal.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:33.220]   And so I have it. By the way, it must weigh about five ounces. Five ounces of what gold?
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:41.060]   1,200, 1,300? I got it under lock and key. So to give a little break in the proceedings,
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:45.900]   we're now going to, I hope, try this.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:52.280]   The gold medal of the Pennsylvania Society was first presented in 1909 on the occasion
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:57.860]   of the Society's 10th anniversary. Since then, the medal has been presented to leaders in
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:04.220]   art, education, entertainment, sports, politics, science, and business. In addition to the
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:10.780]   medal itself, the Society presents $50,000 to the Pennsylvania Society Scholarship Program
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:15.180]   with the McGuire Foundation in honor of our gold medalist.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.800]   This year, the Society is honored to present the gold medal to an innovative leader in
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:27.580]   finance and investment, a man who is widely admired and respected for his courage, his
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.820]   dedication, and his commitment to the rights of investors, the founder of the Vanguard
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:47.900]   Group, Mr. John C. Bogle. I invite you to turn your attention to the large screens positioned
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:56.060]   around the room in order to view a biographical video presentation saluting the life and achievements
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:19.300]   of Jack Bogle.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:25.140]   He was born less than six months before the stock market crash of 1929 forever altered
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:31.420]   the financial and social landscape of America. He grew up during the Great Depression when
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:38.900]   the aftermath of an economic collapse erased the fortunes and clouded the futures of millions.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:44.140]   He overcame obstacles and succeeded against odds and under circumstances that might have
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:50.740]   defeated a less determined and dedicated man. John Clifton Bogle came into the world on
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:57.660]   May 8th, 1929. Jack, as he was commonly called, and his twin brother, David, were the second
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:03.740]   and third sons of William Yates Bogle Jr. and Josephine Lorraine Hipkins. Their father
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.420]   flew with the British Royal Flying Corps in World War I and worked for the American Brick
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.940]   Corporation, a company founded by his own father. Along with their older brother, Bill,
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:19.260]   the twins grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, a suburb just 20 or so miles to the west of
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.140]   New York City. If not for the market crash, theirs would have been a comfortable and affluent
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:30.740]   existence, but the fortunes of the Bogle family were not immune to the economic fallout that
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:36.360]   spread over America and the entire globe. To help support the family, all three boys
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:42.740]   took on multiple jobs while attending school. By the age of 10, Jack was delivering newspapers
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.860]   and magazines and working in an ice cream parlor. The lessons learned in those years
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:53.620]   made a lasting impression upon him. They shaped his character, his personal beliefs, and the
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:59.660]   professional code he would carry throughout his life. Josephine Bogle wanted a first-class
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:05.900]   education for her sons. She managed to get them enrolled in Blair Academy, a nearby private
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.260]   boarding school for their junior and senior years. Although the tuition was beyond the
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:15.740]   family's means, Josephine's investment banker brother was able to help, and Blair offered
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:22.460]   them scholarships and campus jobs. Gifted from the start, with an aptitude for math,
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:29.460]   Jack thrived at Blair. His classmates voted him most likely to succeed and best student,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:34.900]   and he graduated second in his class. He was disappointed that he failed to be the valedictorian,
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:40.620]   having set that as his goal, but his gratitude and support for Blair would continue throughout
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:47.380]   his life. At Princeton, as at Blair, his education was funded with university scholarships and
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:52.740]   he worked a host of different student jobs. He majored in economics, and for his required
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:58.740]   senior thesis, he chose to research and report on the fledgling mutual fund industry, a relatively
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:06.480]   new and unexplored field, but one that Jack Bogle recognized as having great potential.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:13.740]   This thesis was titled "The Economic Role of the Investment Company." It was 123 pages
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:21.380]   long, and he earned an A+ for his work, graduating magna cum laude. That distinction, and the
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:26.740]   in-depth work he had done to earn it, would lead indirectly to his first job after graduating
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:33.580]   from Princeton in 1951. The document was so highly regarded that it found its way to the
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:40.460]   eyes of Walter Morgan, Princeton class of 1920, the founder and CEO of the fourth largest
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:46.300]   mutual fund in the country, the Wellington Fund. Morgan was so impressed by Jack's thesis
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.540]   that he wanted all of his employees to read it, too, and he printed copies for all 50
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:57.180]   of them. "He knows more about the fund business than we do," Morgan was quoted as saying.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.140]   Although Jack had other career options, he was excited by the possibilities inherent
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:07.940]   in the emerging mutual fund industry. He joined Wellington, and over the next few years made
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:14.100]   it his mission to learn as much as he could about all aspects of the business. By 1955,
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:20.300]   he had officially been named Walter Morgan's assistant, and by 1958, he probably knew as
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:27.820]   much about the mutual fund business as anybody in his field. By the summer of 1956, Jack
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:34.820]   Bogle had developed an interest in something besides mutual funds. Her name was Eve Sherrod.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:40.860]   She was the younger sister of Bogle's Princeton friend, Jay Sherrod. Eve was a 1955 Smith
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:47.580]   College graduate and lived in Marion, Pennsylvania. The two were married in September 1956. Their
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:56.320]   union has lasted 60 years and counting. Parents of six children and 12 grandchildren, they
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:03.200]   have lived in the greater Philadelphia area ever since. As Bogle's confidence and understanding
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.940]   of the industry grew, he assumed a more active role in the company's strategy. He advocated
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:17.220]   adding growth, income, and bond funds under the Wellington ambit. By the end of the decade,
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:22.860]   with Bogle's encouragement, a second fund was created at Wellington, this one devoted
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:30.680]   specifically to stocks. In 1958, the Wellington Equity Fund was introduced, changing its name
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:38.500]   in 1963 to the Windsor Fund. In the midst of these developments, Jack's unsuspected
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:45.220]   health problems began to reveal themselves. Until the age of 31, he had enjoyed good health.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:50.500]   But while playing tennis with his brother-in-law one afternoon in the late summer of 1960,
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:57.780]   he suffered the first of six heart attacks. The attack led to a six-week stay in the hospital,
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:04.300]   where Bogle was diagnosed with a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia. The outlook
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:10.960]   was bleak. The cardiologists gave him little chance of living past the age of 40. None
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:17.280]   of them thought he should or could return to work. But his personal drive, his commitment
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.020]   to excel, and his will to survive, the "Bogle factor" as one of his cardiologists would
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:32.240]   call it, proved them all wrong. Bogle was not about to give up. In 1965, the mutual
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:39.120]   fund business began to change. Conservative investing, Wellington Fund's métier, went
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:45.680]   out of style. And aggressive, high-risk investing took center stage. To add an aggressive fund
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.980]   to Wellington's line, and to bring in new managers, Bogle negotiated a merger with Thorndike,
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:57.180]   Doran, Payne, and Lewis, an investment counseling firm based in Boston. The merger became official
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:04.340]   in 1966, and things went well at the outset. Jack was named president and CEO of the newly
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.380]   created firm, but disagreements between the partners about the firm's investment strategies
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:17.220]   led to a parting of the ways during the 1973-1974 stock market crash. The new merger failed,
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:25.560]   and they decided to fire Bogle from the firm. On September 24, 1974, John Bogle formed a
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:32.100]   new corporation. He named it the Vanguard Group, after Admiral Nelson's flagship HMS
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.520]   Vanguard at the Battle of the Nile during the Napoleonic Wars. Vanguard would give Bogle
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:44.120]   the opportunity to put his own beliefs and an innovative investment strategy into practice.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:51.080]   Vanguard's first index investment trust was created in 1976 with a mere $11.3 million
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:58.760]   in assets. But his work was met with scorn and ridicule. Some called the index fund "Bogle's
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:07.080]   Folly," and relentlessly criticized it, labeling it "un-American." It took two decades until
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:13.960]   the mid-1990s for index funds to catch on with the public, but their growth now dominates
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:22.320]   the industry. In 1989, Mr. Morgan, then 91 years of age, he would live to be 100, looked
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:29.260]   back with delight on Bogle's successful leadership of the firm. He stated, "The best thing I
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:36.360]   ever did was to persuade Jack to join our organization." Despite continued heart problems,
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:43.020]   John Bogle remained at Vanguard's helm as chairman and CEO. Finally, in 1996, he received
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:49.320]   a successful heart transplant, a procedure that in large part restored his physical vigor.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:54.200]   He stepped down as CEO that same year, but continued as chairman of Wellington Fund and
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:59.600]   the other Vanguard funds until 1998. After leaving the Vanguard Board of Directors in
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:05.520]   2000, he concentrated on writing and advocating on behalf of the rights of investors and fund
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:11.080]   shareholders and the benefits of long-term investment strategies. He authored numerous
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:18.280]   articles and 10 books, including the 2007 bestseller, "The Little Book of Common Sense
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:24.520]   Investing," along with "The Clash of the Cultures," "Enough," and "The Battle for the Soul of
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:32.920]   Capitalism." In 1999, Fortune magazine named John Bogle one of the "Four Investment Giants
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:41.600]   of the 20th Century." Today, at the age of 87, John Bogle is president of Vanguard's
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.360]   Bogle Financial Markets Research Center in Malvern, Pennsylvania. He continues to promote
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:54.240]   the investment principles he had laid out 65 years earlier in his senior thesis at Princeton.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:02.040]   The Pennsylvania Society is proud to present its 2016 Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.720]   to John C. Bogle.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   [applause]
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   [applause]
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   [applause]
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   [applause]
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   I can't tell you how many people have complimented the Society on selecting Jack Bogle for this
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.320]   award. There isn't a person that I haven't talked to on any given day since we announced
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.960]   it that don't tell me that you are their hero.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   All right.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:04.960]   [laughter]
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:11.760]   I'm so pleased on behalf of the Society to present you with our Gold Medal Award. Well
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   deserved.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   [applause]
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   Thank you.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   Thank you.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   [applause]
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:33.800]   It's mine, Nick. Where are you?
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.480]   [laughter]
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:41.200]   Thank you so much, Roger. I'm deeply honored. And thank you, Carol Fitzgerald, for all your
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.960]   work in organizing this evening. What a big job.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.160]   And it's great to be here with all of you, and I particularly am honored to be with this
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.120]   wonderful head table. So many people. Those are the people we call the big shots back
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.560]   in my corner of the world.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.520]   And to all of you, thank you for being here tonight, and particularly those of you who
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:08.200]   are here who are Vanguard shareholders.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.160]   I want to thank you for paying my salary for all these years.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:25.440]   Most of you, I imagine, know the story of Acres of Diamonds, a lecture first given 132
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:31.840]   years ago by Pennsylvanian Russell Conwell, founder of Temple University. It's the story
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:39.120]   of a wealthy lord in ancient Persia who leaves his estate to seek even greater wealth, spending
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:47.040]   the rest of his life in a fruitless search for a perhaps mythical diamond mine.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:56.120]   Years later, far from home, frustrated, unhappy, a pauper, he throws himself into the sea and
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:03.920]   dies. And at almost the same moment, the very same moment, the fabulous Golconda mine is
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:11.080]   found back in Persia in a stream on his very own property. Think about that.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:18.000]   Dr. Conwell thought the moral of the story was obvious. Quote, "Your diamonds are not
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.840]   in far distant mountains or in yonder seas. They are in your own backyard if you but dig
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:34.720]   for them." His insight is my story. I first set foot in our great commonwealth of Pennsylvania
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:43.120]   just before Christmas of 1945. My twin brother David, bless his soul, was with me, two 16-year-old
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:50.400]   boys from Blair Academy arriving in Pennsylvania to celebrate the holiday with our parents.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:56.120]   They had just moved here from New Jersey and we lived on the third floor of a home in Ardmore.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:01.040]   The space was enough for all of us, at least during the holidays.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.320]   It was in the city of brotherly love that I began to find my own acres of diamonds.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.000]   That first diamond was Walter L. Morgan. You saw him up there in a number of places, wonderful
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.760]   man, my great mentor, founder of Wellington Fund. Immediately after my graduation from
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.960]   Princeton University, by the way, thank you Nasoons, he hired me. Five years later I found
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:28.920]   another diamond. She's with us tonight, a diamond right on Pennsylvania's green acres,
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:47.480]   my beloved Eve, wife of 60 years. Some 21 diamonds followed. Six wonderful children,
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:53.880]   12 grandchildren, and now three great-grandchildren. All of those diamonds alone would make a grand
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:59.640]   crown, wouldn't they? But there were many more diamonds to come, yes, all in my own
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:05.360]   backyard. During those early years at Wellington, however, the diamonds lying before me were
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:13.840]   deeply hidden. The company fell into trouble at times. In 1965, when I was about 35 years
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:20.080]   old, self-confident and more than a little arrogant, Mr. Morgan told me to run his firm
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.360]   and do whatever it takes, that's a quote, "whatever it takes" to solve our investment
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:30.840]   management and marketing challenges. As that lovely video tribute suggests, my effort to
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:40.560]   save the firm resulted in my getting fired as Wellington's CEO in January 1974, and my
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:50.240]   adversaries intended to move all of Wellington to Boston. I was not about to let that happen.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:57.000]   I love Philadelphia, my adopted city, the home of my family, the home of my firm. I
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.040]   intended to keep those diamonds right here. After a tough struggle, that determination
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:10.520]   paid off. I created a new company that would do just that, inspired by HMS Vanguard, Lord
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:17.240]   Nelson's flagship. Check your medallion, everybody, it's a very nice representation of it there.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:25.640]   I named the firm the Vanguard Group with Wellington Fund as our largest fund. Look, guys, Benjamin
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:39.040]   Franklin got it right. The diamonds aren't going to Boston, Boston is going to Philadelphia.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:46.040]   To be here for good, right where they belong, in the birthplace of Wellington Fund in 1928
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:52.560]   and of Vanguard in 1974. I described our new firm as the Vanguard experiment in corporate
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:54:00.260]   governance designed to serve our mutual fund shareholders. A faint echo, at least, of William
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:07.520]   Penn's description of the Pennsylvania colony as his holy experiment in freedom for its
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:14.480]   citizens. A nice parallel. The new firm was founded on two innovations that you've just
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:20.420]   heard about and described, both without precedent in the mutual fund field. Two more diamonds.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:26.200]   One diamond was our mutual structure, designed to serve its own shareholders. The other,
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:32.980]   our strategy. The world's first index fund, a simple, economical way to give investors
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:38.460]   their fair share of market returns. Together, these two diamonds would become far more valuable
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:47.360]   even than that fabulous Golconda that I mentioned at the beginning. Fabulous values for investors.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.680]   These ideas are changing the world of finance in favor of investors, of Main Street rather
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:59.440]   than Wall Street. That trend is just beginning, and I'm sorry in a certain way about this
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:05.320]   Wall Street, but it's going to get even worse for you and better for investors. It's all
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:13.800]   about who gets those returns. So Vanguard has become the largest mutual fund management
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:21.700]   in the world as a result of those ideas, starting from a career of tragedy, followed by triumph,
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:29.480]   to which I would add, "Oh, ye of little faith." I continued to dig in my own backyard and
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:36.520]   discovered still more diamonds. In 1996, I found another diamond that was a new heart,
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.680]   a diamond that was a heart, transplanted at Philadelphia's Hahnemann University. For the
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.280]   past two-plus decades, I've been treated at Pennsylvania Hospital, Hospital of University
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:53.080]   of Pennsylvania, HUP, by another diamond, my cardiologist for all that time, Dr. Susan
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:56:01.800]   Barzina. The transplant was a success, yes, from another diamond, and this one was in
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:14.400]   Pittsburgh. Hello, Allegheny County. Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh led
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:19.400]   the development of anti-rejection drugs that were essential to survival for patients who
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:25.120]   were lucky enough to have successful transplants. Not a moment too soon, only in the late '80s,
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:30.160]   did that discover, and I got my transplant in '96. That heart that I got now, 46 years
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:37.640]   of age, keeps on ticking. It just keeps on ticking. And that's all right, that's all
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:50.480]   right. A second chance at life is a miracle, and don't think I don't know it, pal. Lucky
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.320]   enough to find all those diamonds in Pennsylvania, I was determined to give some diamonds back
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.840]   to Pennsylvania. One of my favorite causes has been supporting and helping lead the National
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:10.680]   Constitution Center that caps off Philadelphia's Independence Mall. For the three decades since
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:18.200]   its inception, I've served as a trustee, and in 1988, I was asked to serve as chairman
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:24.600]   by its then chairman and former governor, Ed Rendell, and its then president, and now
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:34.920]   treasurer-elect of our commonwealth, Joe Torricella. I warned them that I wouldn't be too good
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:40.600]   at it and would only serve for a short time until they found a real chairman. But working
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:45.980]   with Joe was a thrill, and the challenge of turning an idea into a reality, you could
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:55.320]   even say again, I served for chairman for nine more years. That was my short time. The
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:00.280]   National Constitution Center continues to serve its noble mission, bringing the Constitution
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:08.320]   of the United States of America into the mainstream of our citizens' lives. Let me wrap this up,
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.760]   probably a little bit long already, but in retrospect, it occurs to me that my design
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:23.040]   for Vanguard reflects many of the basic Quaker values that William Penn fostered, simplicity,
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:33.080]   economy, efficiency, service to others, and the conviction that the truth is the way.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:47.980]   Now, I'm not so strong on other values of the Quakers, like consensus, patience, and
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:54.720]   of course, silence. William Penn has been a constant inspiration for me, and I close
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:03.160]   tonight with delight to be with all of you with the 1620 quotation attributed to Pennsylvania's
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:12.640]   founder, a goal that I strive to honor, but as a flawed human being will never fully measure.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:18.720]   You know this quote, many of you. I expect to pass through this world, but once, any
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:26.480]   good, therefore, that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow creature, let
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:32.800]   me do it now. Let me do it now, for I shall not pass this way again. Thank you for the
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:52.480]   honor you've bestowed on me.
[00:59:52.480 --> 01:00:19.920]   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.120]   You are truly a treasure of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and I'm so proud to have
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:32.640]   you with us tonight. Let's see, a couple of chores here. Apparently, in the introductions
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:41.880]   earlier this evening, we failed to advise that Auditor General Eugene D. Pasquale is
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:50.880]   here this evening. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. And because our honored guest is so
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:01:01.560]   impressive, we're honoring a request that you just made to have the Soons come back
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:23.680]   and sing "Old Nassau," one verse. So, thank you, Jack. Thank you. Are they getting it?
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:34.040]   They're getting it. I know it.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:47.120]   Every boy and every boy, in every care withdraw, let all in one accord rejoice in praise of
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:02:01.760]   old Nassau. In praise of old Nassau, my boy, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah. Her sons will give,
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:27.200]   while they shall live three cheers for old Nassau. Thank you, Jack.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:34.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to rise and join the Princeton Nassoons and Trooper
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:55.440]   Kevin Pierce in singing a traditional Pennsylvania society favorite, "God Bless America."
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:09.000]   God bless America, land that I love. Stand beside her and guide her, through the night
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:21.400]   with the light from above. From the mountains to the prairies, to the oceans, where it flows.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:38.720]   God bless America, my home sweet home. God bless America, my home sweet home.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:52.240]   God bless America, land that I love. Stand beside her and guide her, through the night
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:04:04.720]   with the light from above. From the mountains to the prairies, to the oceans, where it flows.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:26.720]   God bless America, my home sweet home. God bless America, my home sweet home.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:46.800]   Thanks, Mike. That was a great job. So, okay, it was an enchanted evening, and to hell with
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:54.600]   it. It was really, really nice, and we had a great time. A lot of my family came, and
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.520]   so that was really a highlight of the year, and if you've got to get an award, that's
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:06.600]   probably as good a response as you can make. I'm not quite at my top speaking style there,
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:13.320]   but I was okay, I think. Now we're going to go back to work, and I have, how much time?
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:20.120]   Half an hour? And we're going to do a little data thing, and we're going to start with
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.280]   an industry in transition, how this industry has changed. We're going to rip through these
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:28.000]   fairly quickly, and again, the slides will be available to anybody that wants them.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:36.440]   So I was there, and I am here, thank goodness, as a tiny industry grew into a behemoth. A
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:43.060]   lot of bumps along the way, but an industry that grows since I joined it in 1951 at 14%
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:50.880]   a year is a pretty good industry to pick as a choice from your ancient senior thesis at
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.800]   Princeton University. And you'll see we're an equity industry when I came in, 78% stock
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:03.360]   funds, still a stronger equity industry at 1972, 87% stock funds. Then we had the market
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:12.360]   crash of '73, '74, and by 1981, money market and bond funds were 83% of this business.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:19.920]   And now we're back to a more normal equity funds, 52%, balance funds 8%, and bond funds
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:28.440]   22%, and money market funds about 17% way down, that combination being 39% compared
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:34.360]   to 83%. But we've had a firm that could ride with those punches because I've always been
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.400]   interested in all those areas.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:44.880]   But the biggest change of all was the obvious one, the indexing revolution. And you can
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:51.240]   see indexing share of mutual fund assets has gone to 41% now. It's amazing of equity fund
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:58.840]   assets and to 23% of bond fund assets, and it keeps on growing. Yes, it is the index
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:05.440]   revolution, and you can see that chart there. I'll go quickly through it. I don't want to
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:13.440]   waste a lot of time on it, but there's nothing quite like in all financial history the way
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.960]   the index fund has changed an entire industry and even an entire financial industry. You'll
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:31.240]   see there that when the index 2017 is $7 trillion has gone up, regular funds have gone up, I'm
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:44.780]   sorry, index funds have gone up 1.7 times, and the index funds have gone up 6 times from
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:55.120]   the beginning. Compound growth rate, the industry, non-equity industry, 14%, 37% a year for index
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:03.240]   funds. So it's quite a remarkable thing, that little idea of 1974.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.000]   There are big changes in mutual fund industry leadership. I'm not sure this chart is very
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.680]   easy to read, but I took a look at the big funds back in 1980 when the industry had reached
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:19.720]   sort of a mature stage after the '74 crash, and you can see the leaders there. We ranked
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:30.240]   number seven in 1980, advanced the clock to 2017, Vanguard ranks number one with a 2,005-fold
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:36.640]   increase in assets. Vanilla didn't do badly, 588-fold increase in assets, but only about
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   a fourth of what Vanguard did. And then we have new entrants, BlackRock, State Street,
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:50.000]   both indexers, J.P. Morgan, Franklin Templeton, Dimensional Fund, they were these firms, and
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.760]   PIMCO, where they were not in business in 1980, were very, very small. And so now those
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:11.680]   10 firms are 62% of industry assets as compared to 55%, so a little more concentration.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:21.300]   You also see the ones that have dropped out of the top 10, are they in blue? No. Well,
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:26.240]   the funds that have dropped out of the top 10 in 1980 are IDS now, Columbia or whatever
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:37.040]   it's called, the largest firm in the business then, Mass Financial, Putnam, a tragic story,
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.200]   Fort Abbott Affiliated Fund, and Union Service, which is the, I'm not even sure what the name
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:48.120]   of it is anymore, but they all dropped. That's a lot of change in industry leadership.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.960]   Expense ratios, very interesting thing that's going on here. I may have shown you this chart
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.440]   last year or two, but if you look at the traditional industry and go back to when I came into this
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:05.920]   business in 1951, the average fund in this group of actively managed funds had a 0.62
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:14.880]   expense ratio, and by 2016, that had risen to 1.06% or up 72%, and this upstart called
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:21.280]   Vanguard dropped from 55, a little below average, to 0.15, you'll see that in the red line a
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:28.240]   little bit up from the bottom, or down 73%. I can't imagine how this can persist in a
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:35.280]   competitive framework when one group of funds goes up 72% in cost ratios and the other one
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.640]   goes down 73%. Well, I don't think I did a very good job
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:46.760]   on explaining it all. What I'm trying to say here is that if we were run, we run the firm
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.760]   for around $4 billion a year, and if we were running at that conventional mode above, the
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:59.800]   cost would be $25 billion a year, $21 billion of savings every year for shareholders, and
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:06.360]   happily, lower cost means stronger returns, and we'll, I guess, get that a little bit
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.160]   later. So, I've seen all this happen firsthand. An
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:17.240]   industry that sells what it makes, it's the old industry, became an industry that made
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:25.000]   what would sell. We've gone through public ownership, a really catastrophic thing in
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.280]   the industry, it still persists, public ownership of advisors, where the idea is to make as
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:36.120]   much money for the owners as you possibly can at the expense of the fund shareholders.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:42.240]   We've gone through the go-go era, a whole lot of junk, false accounting, story stocks,
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.920]   and that came and went. We had the rise and fall of the so-called nifty-fifty, 25 stocks
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.760]   or 50 stocks, I guess, you could buy and hold forever, and they were all pretty good stocks,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:12:01.960]   Xerox, IBM, except the prices that were paid have never been seen again. So, it's not just
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.480]   the value of the company, it's the price you pay for it.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.920]   Then we went through a whole new industry created, money market funds, saw back there,
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:17.480]   I think it was 80%, 83% maybe of industry assets, and then we get to the information
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:22.680]   age, the rise and fall of technology funds, catastrophic to investors in them. We had
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:28.200]   done away with ours years before, one of the smarter moves, sometimes doing nothing or
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.680]   reversing a decision is better than making the decision itself.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.600]   Then we get to the age of the traditional index fund, TIF. I'm trying to get that damn
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.200]   thing accepted as a way of art, speaking like we talk about ETFs as if there's nothing else,
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:51.160]   but the TIF is a traditional index fund, and the one that kind of started a broad market,
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:59.520]   S&P 500, for example, low cost, and designed to be held forever. I'll talk a little bit
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.800]   about that in a few minutes.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.320]   Then we come to where we are right now, and it's an interesting thing, which I'll talk
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:12.040]   about in a few minutes, the exchange-traded fund era, which we have today. Now, in the
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:17.880]   next decade, the return to what I will call a new normalcy, which is the triumph of traditional
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:24.240]   index investing, not ETF investing. I was accused in the press, I guess I said this,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.000]   of saying I think BlackRock, which is entirely ETFs, is betting on the wrong horse, and we
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.060]   betting on TIFs are betting on the right horse, but we will see.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:40.320]   But in each era, I tried to deal with it when I ran the company, and even after I ran the
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:46.480]   company, and for each error for that matter, I did my best to build a better industry and
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.080]   preach about my convictions.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:58.520]   So how's it doing? Well, in 2017, Vanguard is shooting the lights out, giving new meaning
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:07.320]   to - I worry about it, and I worry about what is enough for a $4.5 trillion company on its
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:13.120]   way to $5 trillion. Think of that. I mean, I don't even like it. I'm sorry about that,
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.480]   but I'm a small company guy.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:22.840]   So there are the industry cash flows Mike has up there, and you'll see that in the last
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:32.240]   - what is that - five years, roughly, Vanguard has taken in $793 billion of cash - think
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:41.080]   of that - from new investors, and the total industry has taken in $815 billion. That means
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:47.400]   the other firms, compared to one firm, $793 billion of additional capital. Everybody else
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:56.840]   put together has taken in $22 billion. It's 97% of the industry's cash flow for five years.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.560]   And it's good, I guess. It's a tribute to the good idea, but it also somehow leaves
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:09.000]   me wondering what's the end game or something, and I don't have to worry about that now.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.240]   But guess what? I still worry about it. And you'll see the cash flows here, growing and
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:22.960]   growing and growing. Indexing totally driving it. That's the blue line. And so I ask again,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.760]   what is enough? And I don't know the answer to that, but don't think I don't think about
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.040]   it, and don't think about the challenges that indexing faces in the years ahead.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:37.560]   Now how are we doing with the competition? Well, here we are with the large managers,
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.200]   and you can see we're all clustered pretty closely, all except that State Street was
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:50.720]   very small then, from around $300 billion to around $700 billion. And the turning point
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:16:01.400]   came in 2006, when Vanguard's assets topped Fidelity's. Vanguard assets $1.123 billion.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:07.960]   Fidelity's assets $1.111 billion. That was a very close race. But you can see it wasn't
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:15.240]   close. That was in 2006. And look at the lines go from there, just totally separate. And
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:20.160]   I'm not sure very many businesses have ever experienced a period of leadership like that.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:26.000]   And again, I'm not sure what I think about them. I'm glad to have the ideas, my ideas,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.600]   given such acceptance by the public, but I still worry about, I won't say it again, worry
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:38.320]   about size and what it does to a company, and what it does to challenges like regulatory
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.440]   authorities and things of that nature.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:49.720]   So our market share is at a new high again of 24.2, up from a low of 4.1, and we lost,
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:57.480]   was at a third of our market share in our first, that's 1986. In our first 12 years,
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:04.960]   we lost a third of our market share. There's a tribute to a great company. And then I actually,
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.840]   this may not surprise you, I loved those days. I loved the days of struggle. I loved the
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.000]   days where you were the first one in the office every day, and everybody's trying to do their
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.200]   best and trying to find a piece of good news. We had 83 months of net redemptions, and people
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.080]   say, "How'd you deal with that?" To which I would say, "Well, look, we lost $22 million
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.360]   of redemptions last month, but the previous month we lost $24 million. So think of that
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.480]   improvement. Keep a stiff upper lip."
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:43.280]   But when you get big, I gave a speech on this subject, "Uneasy lies the head that wears
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:49.040]   the crown," and this chart just shows the changing leadership in the company. First
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:56.280]   MFS, Mass Investors Trust, is the firm written up in my senior thesis at college, and they
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:01.400]   got to about a 15% market share, the lowest cost provider in the industry at that time.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.680]   And then IDS, which is a big, it's called Columbia I think now or something, but big
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.520]   direct distributor, direct distribution, overwhelmed broker distribution for a short period of
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:19.160]   time, well, for about 20 some years. And they got to about 15% and then fell back.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:25.720]   Then along comes Fidelity with their hot performance, and they got to almost 14% back in 1999, fell
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:32.880]   back. And that putative natural high, which you can see there, it's like 15% is the limit.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.680]   History has established that. And here we are at 24.2, and it's not going to be lower
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.640]   than that next year or the year after that.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.040]   The reason for all that, of course, is the index funds. And you will see right in this
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:53.080]   chart that if you are one of these leaders, Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, really
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:19:00.200]   an oligopoly, which is worrisome in some ways. Nobody wants to compete in that area. And
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:08.840]   so I think we are going to, indexing is going to continue to take over. We are going to
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:15.320]   continue to hold our market share leadership. But if we broaden the term index funds, this
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:22.180]   is an interesting byplay, if we broaden the term index funds to talk about indexed assets,
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:28.740]   we get an even stronger picture for Vanguard's 73% in index funds.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:34.540]   In the very beginning of Vanguard, even before the index fund, they used to talk about relative
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:40.100]   predictability. We wanted relative predictability from our funds, because if you get very good,
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.620]   you know you are going to get bad if you got any brains at all. And then the money comes
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.980]   in when you are good, and the money goes out when you are bad. And the shareholders do
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:52.060]   much worse than the fund. That's a characteristic of this business. It costs investors about
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:59.580]   1.5% in return every year, a huge deficit over time. And so relative predictability
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:06.100]   dominates Vanguard funds. For an astonishing way, if you put virtual index funds that are
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:14.400]   driven by indexes, track indexes, with our index funds, pure index funds, you are talking
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:24.940]   99% of Vanguard's assets. I don't know why that 88 is there. I might strike that.
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:32.220]   So here is how we examine that on the next page, and you will see exactly what I mean.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:45.260]   And that is when you get to relative predictability of 1974, with all the changes in academic
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:55.460]   kind of stuff, it is now high R-squared. And R-squared is the amount of your fund's return
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:04.140]   is determined by the returns of the index or indexes that the fund uses as its objective.
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:15.860]   The best example I have for that is Wellington Fund. Our baseline is 65% S&P 500, 35% long
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:30.140]   term corporate bond index, and if you put those two together, those two indexes explain
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:36.140]   98% of Wellington's performance. So if you want to look at it this way, and maybe people
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:41.500]   do not want to look at it this way, on a $100 billion fund, which Wellington is again after
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:48.540]   all these years, no, its previous high was $2 billion, sorry, you are going to say that
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:57.060]   2% of that is from activity, active management, so that would be $2 billion, and $98 billion
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:03.500]   would be tied to the index. So that is the 98 R-squared, and you look at these others,
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:09.980]   high R-squared business, and you put it all together and just multiply through these R-squares
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:19.020]   on the index to the fund's assets, and that is where the 23% comes from.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:25.420]   So that is just what I want to happen, just the way I designed when I redid Wellington
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:32.940]   Fund in 1980, and it has worked very well. There is a fund that went from $2 billion
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:40.460]   to $450 million, then I tried to fix it, did my best to fix it in 1980, and now it is $102
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:44.740]   billion. It is amazing what you can do if you just put a little thought into something.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:51.980]   So put it all together, Vanguard's dominance is no mystery. Why are we a leader? I will
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:58.500]   tell you why. One is our structure, low cost. Two is our strategy, virtual index funds and
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:05.580]   indexing. They turn out to have consistent, solid returns for the owners, and that turns
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:11.100]   out to be outstanding performance, and it is quite remarkable. I probably showed you
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.420]   this chart. I whittled it down a little bit. I probably should have done it a little bit
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:21.100]   more. Just let me take you through a little bit of it, and that is when you rank on August
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:29.180]   17, rank the various fund leaders by the number of funds they have, how many are 1 and 2 star,
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:34.300]   low rated funds, and how many are 4 or 5 star, high rated funds, and what the net difference
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:40.060]   between the low rated is. Vanguard has, as far as I can remember, been at the top of
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:46.540]   this list forever. For a few years we were tied with T. Rowe Price, but what this says
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:56.340]   is 2% of our funds were low rated, 73% were high rated, and 71% net. One thing that causes
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:01.300]   that, which is why it is right in the next column, is the lowest expense ratio by far
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:08.140]   on that whole page, .17. It is going to go down. It can't go down a lot further, so we
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:15.820]   are still going to be tough. T. Rowe Price is often a very tough competitor. I haven't
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:21.380]   tracked it enough to figure out why they have dropped down on this. They are 10%, 66%, and
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:28.020]   net 56%, so they are 15 points behind us. Look at how those net returns, let's concentrate
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:36.060]   on that column saying net, getting 71.50, and look at how it goes down. You should be,
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:40.180]   the average is probably 28, something like that. I guess it is 19 when you take all of
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:45.100]   the firms. Look at the firms that are even in negative territory when you get down to
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:52.460]   the bottom. Look at Goldman Sachs. The one thing you want to know is that Goldman Sachs
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:25:05.220]   faithfully and eternally puts the client first. That is what they say. They have 36% compared
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:11.820]   to our two low rated funds, even less, 28% in high rated funds for a negative of 7%.
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:18.140]   They are the champion, as it were. They have a very high expense ratio. I will just make
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:21.860]   one more observation. You can look at this when you see the charts if you want to. It
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:26.660]   is amazing. I went back 10 years, we have been doing this for about 10 years, to August
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:34.860]   of 2007, and it is amazing how the top funds with the lowest cost by and large maintain
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:45.420]   their position, Vanguard 1, T. Rowe Price 4, TIAA 6, Dimensional 3, Janus 2, American
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:56.620]   Funds 5, and JP Morgan, I guess it is 7. No, it is American 7. Schwab didn't mention Schwab.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:06.380]   At the bottom, 10 years ago, Legg Mason ranked 40, now they rank 42. Putnam ranked 50, and
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:13.780]   they have leaped up to 45. Goldman Sachs had a really solid improvement there. They went
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:20.140]   up from rank 45, did not have an improvement, but a deterioration. Not easy to get worse
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:26.980]   when you are at 45 out of 50, but they slipped back to 46.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:32.060]   So you can measure what we are doing pretty well.
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:45.340]   Next slide. You win the way we did, and then the question is, how do funds generally do,
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:51.060]   beating the market and beating the competition? I am going to try and wrap this up without
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.140]   being too long.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:27:00.060]   So the first slide is for the first time this spring, SPIVA, Standard & Poor's Investment
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:08.600]   Performance something valuation, for the first time they did 15 years, and here are the results.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:14.380]   In large growth, the index was outperformed by 5%. I will do it the other way around.
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:21.060]   The index outperformed 95% of all large growth funds, the proper growth index.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:30.640]   Large core, the index outperformed, looks like 96%, 7%. In large value, the index only
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.220]   outperformed about 17%.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:46.780]   In mid-cap growth, the index outperformed about 3%. Mid-core the same. Mid-value, 14%.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:51.660]   Only 14% do better, and so on down the line.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:28:00.900]   So the average of all of those is 7.8%. I am sorry, 78%. And so the index outperformed
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:14.540]   7.8%, right. I got you, thank you. 7.8% outperformed the universe.
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:21.740]   So it just isn't a good bet to go with an actively managed fund.
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:27.660]   So what do you do? You pick winning funds, right?
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:33.100]   Let me tell you a little bit about that. Reversion to the mean, you have heard that before.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:38.700]   What happens to the winning funds after you buy them? We did this test, we have done it
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:42.980]   for a lot of different periods, and this is pretty representational of the total, but
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:51.020]   we took the highest returns, the highest quintile of returns in the period 2006-2011, and then
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:29:06.260]   compared that fund's rank in 2011-2016. The highest quintile had 14% in the recurred and
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:12.180]   in the highest return group, highest quintile, and 14% in the high quintile group, and twice
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:18.340]   as many, twice as many funds, more than twice as many actually, no, just about twice as
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:26.780]   many, in the low and lowest categories, 27% in 30 years. So we had 28% in the first two
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:35.580]   categories that repeated, and 57 funds that went to the bottom of the deck.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:41.100]   And it is a strange parallel, if you go down to the bottom, lowest return, you have 49%
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:47.840]   of the winners in the two top quintiles, 24 and 25, and they drop all the way down, rise
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:54.180]   all the way down, I'm sorry, drop down to the 30th percentile as losers. So the winners
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:30:02.060]   don't repeat, they revert to the mean and beyond, and the losers do the same thing,
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:09.020]   they revert to the mean and do better. So they only have 49% in the top quintile, the
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:15.340]   top two quintiles, and 30% in the bottom two. So when you think about the parallelism, for
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:26.900]   the highest returns, 28% good, 57% bad, and lowest quintiles, 49% good and only 30% bad,
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:31.140]   just the reverse. And if you look at the middle ones, they are pretty much concentrated around
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:39.380]   20, you'll see that number appear a lot. So it's just the way it is. And this is a little
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:45.620]   complicated chart, but it bears the same message it's always been. Now, I'm just going to,
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:51.940]   I forgot this, we have to do this. Traditional index funds, TIFs again, and ETFs and their
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:57.300]   intramural competition. The rise of the index fund, particularly in more recent years, last
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:04.940]   20 years, has been driven by the rise in ETFs. You can see that right here. ETFs have grown
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:14.380]   at 35% growth rate, and traditional index funds at only, maybe the right word, a 16%
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:23.020]   growth rate, and active funds at an 8% growth rate. So when you look at TIFs and ETFs together,
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:31.140]   I don't want to take too much time, but here's the difference. First index mutual fund, TIF,
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:35.380]   principles, own the stock market, diversify to the nth degree, minimize transaction costs,
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:40.620]   tiny expense ratio, bought to be held forever. Exchange traded funds, principles, pick your
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:48.140]   own index, there are only 1,900 now available. Diversify in any sector you choose, lower
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:57.420]   your expenses, lower expenses generally, but not very low, like 50 basis points. They operate
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:05.980]   at fringe ETFs, very narrowly determined. I think we will skip this next chart, Mike,
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:12.260]   in the interest of time, and we will just check this next one and get to really what
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:17.660]   I thought was one of the more interesting research events. I was fooling around with
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:31.540]   some numbers one day, and I took the growth of the ETF business, and since 2004 to 2016,
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:38.500]   you can see a very interesting thing goes on. They have both grown very rapidly, the
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:48.780]   TIF and the ETF. But in the ETF, three quarters of it was in cash flow. I'm sorry, I'm going
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:58.380]   to correct myself. $800 billion was about half of the cash flow growth, was half of
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:09.700]   the increase in assets, and $500 billion from market appreciation, that is performance.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:16.540]   While the numbers were very different for traditional index funds, $800 billion compared
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:23.140]   to $500 billion from performance, and $400 billion from net cash flow only half as much.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:28.180]   So what we see there, and we tried this experiment, I will show you a little tiny bit more. What
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:35.680]   we see there is the investor return on TIFs in this period was 7.4% a year, and the investor
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:45.260]   return, this is ex-dividends, the investor return on ETFs was 4.6%, only a little, a
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:50.460]   third less, roughly, and active, it is even better than ETFs. So it all depends on what
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:56.340]   you are comparing it with. So we took this further, and did it for each year in the period,
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:34:02.100]   make sure we were doing okay, and just a kind of a test. There is the 7.4 for TIFs, there
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:08.100]   is the 4.6 for ETFs. And they correlate very, very highly with the returns you get from
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:16.860]   Morningstar, which would be the correlation of 96, the R squared, and 99 is for the TIF.
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:23.740]   In other words, that seems to verify that TIFs are not doing nearly as well for their
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:28.220]   investors, that ETFs are not doing nearly as well for their investors.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:31.500]   I am going to skip the next couple of charts on future returns, I think you know what I
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:38.020]   said about them, they are going to be lower than the past, and so investors are going
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:43.500]   to, I am using 4% for stocks, you will see it all in there, 4% for stocks and 3% for
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:50.820]   bonds, and so it is not going to be what we have had in the past, I don't think, and investors
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:54.420]   will have to save more, you will have to save more to get to your objective, to keep the
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:59.020]   objective the same, or reduce your objective, and find that low costs are more important
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:04.340]   than ever. Now, I am going to close with words to live
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:22.860]   by, Matthew, 21 AD, no man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:27.660]   other, or hold to the one and despise the other. That is the problem that Vanguard tried
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:32.340]   to solve by only having one master, the bond shareholder and not the investment advisor,
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:40.140]   and it has worked out pretty well. Adam Smith, the fundamental principle of economics,
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:44.660]   the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:50.040]   promoting that of the consumer. That maxim is so perfectly self-evident that it would
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:56.540]   be absurd to attempt to prove it, the interest of the consumer must be the ultimate end and
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:03.180]   object of all industry and commerce. Paraphrasing it in my own words, the interest of bond shareholders,
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:09.140]   that is, consumers, must finally triumph over the interest of fund managers, that is to
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:13.940]   say the producers. And then a final quote, which is a little
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:22.700]   philosophical, and before we get to that, I want to say I have gotten a little philosophical
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:31.860]   in my age, and I think a lot about a place in history, which is where we started today,
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:38.300]   and what I really want to accomplish, what all this noise about my accomplishments that
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:42.380]   I have given you this morning means, and it probably doesn't mean very much, to be honest
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:52.620]   with you, and nice but not necessary, but I think, curiously enough, I summed all this
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:37:01.540]   up in 1973 A.D. Notice the similarity in years as we go through these. And this was the dedication
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:05.300]   of what was then the Wellington Management Building in Valley Forge, first move out of
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:11.200]   the city, and I am going to read you this in its entirety.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.940]   Today, America is again being tested, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that every
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:21.580]   institution in our society, from the White House on down the line, is being challenged,
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:28.300]   challenged to reassess its goals, its values, its contributions to our society. The White
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:33.740]   House was an issue even then, and here we are today. All those years later, 45 years
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:40.620]   later, whatever, 40 years later, despite the billions of dollars entrusted to us, our company
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:48.120]   is small and fragile and perhaps even unimportant in the vast context of space and time. Nonetheless,
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:53.380]   by doing our work as best we can, we can be better and stronger as individuals and make
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:57.540]   this ambitious and interesting organization, which was about to get more ambitious and
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:02.460]   more interesting, better and stronger too. Each of us can, in a small way, be a positive
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:09.400]   force in helping, typo, to make this land just a little bit better. In short, I believe
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.700]   even one person can make a difference.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:17.940]   So what caught my mind, this came to my mind when we were talking about, when I was thinking
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:23.620]   about what I want to leave behind, and I looked at, I mean, I certainly profoundly believe
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:28.600]   in the importance of the individual, but I also looked at the fact that we are all important
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:36.860]   in the vast context of space and time. Eve and I were watching 60 Minutes on CBS about
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:48.420]   a month ago, and they had a program part, section, on the universe. Here is our part
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:58.820]   in the universe. One, we are part of the Milky Way galaxy. It is 13.6 billion years old.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:09.260]   Its diameter is 150,000 light years. It has 200 billion stars and 100 billion planets.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:18.380]   How important are we in all that? And then the punchline, our galaxy is but one of two
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:24.780]   trillion galaxies out there. That is how important I feel at this moment. Thank you all very
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:25.780]   much.
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:25.780]   [Applause]
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:49.860]   Thank you, Jack.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.860]   [Applause]
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:50.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.860]   [Applause]
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:52.860]   [Applause]
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:54.860]   [Applause]
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:54.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:55.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:56.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:58.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.860]   Thank you.
