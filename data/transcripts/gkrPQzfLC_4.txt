[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   Our next question comes from JK.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.200]   JK asks, "How do you plan your day or week or time block
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.080]   when you have a job that has reactive parts
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.720]   and parts requiring deep work?"
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.400]   JK elaborates, "I'm a pharmacist manager
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.200]   working in a busy hospital environment
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.160]   managing a team of 15 to 20 people at any one time.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.960]   This means I can be interrupted with questions
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.840]   at any time of the day by my staff
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.520]   as well as by other hospital staff outside of my team.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.400]   These interruptions sometimes can be delayed,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.360]   but mostly they are in the moment questions
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.640]   requiring an answer for them
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.920]   to proceed with their hands-on work.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.480]   At the same time, I have non-reactive
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.320]   and deep-thinking work that needs to get done,
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.000]   but that gets pushed aside due to mental overload
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.400]   or lack of time."
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.920]   She gives examples like doing quality improvement work,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.520]   analyzing data, et cetera.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.960]   Well, JK, this is a problem in general with the medical field
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.640]   and in particular hospital work.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.120]   I have given talks to hospitals in person virtually.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.240]   I have worked with various hospital administrators
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.000]   on this problem. So just to lay out that foundation,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.600]   you are not alone in this issue.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.560]   There is a fundamental reactive nature
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.040]   about the way that hospitals run right now,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.800]   which is quite degrading to the cognitive capacity
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.320]   of the individual practitioners,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.760]   and it is a real problem.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.400]   We do need more structure,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.960]   and a lot of hospitals are thinking about this.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.680]   So let me just lay that out there now.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.880]   It's a big problem that hospitals
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.440]   are starting to think about.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.200]   In terms of what you can do before those solutions
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   actually happen is, number one, I would go easy on yourself.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.040]   You aren't going to be able to do a lot of deep work
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.760]   in this environment.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.640]   The cognitive context switching created
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.760]   by all these interruptions is draining.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.640]   It's going to make it hard, even if later
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.200]   you do have time for you to get things done.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.280]   So you might have to actually lower to some degrees
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.080]   your aspirations about how much deep work
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.040]   you're going to get done.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.440]   Two, put aside that time early in the day,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.400]   first time in the day.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.680]   I've negotiated with whatever, my supervisor,
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.320]   my attending, the fellowship director,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.440]   that I'm working on my data analysis
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.960]   Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.800]   I do it from 8 to 10, and then I'm on call.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.840]   You figure this, you probably are going to have
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.760]   to figure out times that are protected much more officially.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.920]   And there might be less of those times than you would like,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.440]   but at least those times are protected.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   They're first thing if possible,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.640]   so you have all your energy and you try to get
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.480]   as much done as possible in those windows
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.440]   when you get there.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.400]   A surprising amount of deep work can get done
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   if you consistently do that.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.200]   That's probably what you're left at right now,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.680]   because the rest of your day is going to be pretty frenzy.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.800]   As for time blocking, I think it just depends
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.280]   on the nature of your work.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.200]   Some inherently reactive jobs aren't well-suited
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.560]   for detailed time blocking.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.280]   You might time block out the big things
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.520]   that you know have to happen,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.040]   so you can see the character of your day,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.560]   but you will be frustrated if it's impossible to know
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.320]   if you're going to get the next hour free,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.480]   or if the next hour is going to be dealing with something
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.080]   that you had no idea was going to happen.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.680]   And in that case, you might not be doing
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.080]   fine grain time blocking.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.400]   So just to quickly summarize,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.840]   hospitals are terrible for this,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.320]   but they are getting better, hopefully.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.880]   Knock on wood.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.840]   I think we have to start with probably banning
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.720]   the inter-messaging feature that was added
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.160]   to Epic EMR record software.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   I've heard a lot about this,
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.920]   that you can now instant message people in the EMR software,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   but that's a whole nother argument.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.800]   Number two, negotiate for the deep work time
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.320]   so it's protected.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.040]   Use the right vocabulary,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.720]   explain why this is important,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.480]   that you want to fit this in,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.680]   point them towards my work, blame it on me,
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.000]   get that time negotiated.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.180]   It'll be less time than you hope,
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.200]   but you'll get more done in that time than you think.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.280]   All right, that's my advice, JK, so good luck.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.420]   (upbeat music)
