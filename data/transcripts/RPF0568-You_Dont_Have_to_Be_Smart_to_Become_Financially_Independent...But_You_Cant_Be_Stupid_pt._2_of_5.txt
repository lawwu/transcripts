[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.160]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.800]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.800]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.800]   I am your host.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.740]   And today we continue with part two of my series, "You Don't Have to Be Smart to Become
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.400]   Financially Independent, But You Can't Be Stupid."
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.180]   And today we talk about expenses.
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.600]   This series is organized around my framework for wealth.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.500]   Part one was increase income.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.460]   If you can do nothing else with money except increase income, you'll naturally have more
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.820]   money.
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.780]   But step two is decrease expenses.
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.620]   Now I love to think and talk about ways of cutting expenses to the bone.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.900]   I love to think and talk about really radical lifestyle decisions.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.600]   But realistically, not many people will do those things.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.980]   But here's the great news.
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.720]   You don't have to do those radical crazy ideas in order to be financially independent.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.740]   You just can't be stupid with your money.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:11.820]   Now if you look at the way that most people spend their money, there are a few expenses
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.320]   that make up a big portion of the error.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.820]   And since this series is focused on simply avoiding stupidity, not trying to make you
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.640]   do something uber smart, just saying that you can't be stupid, let me talk to you about
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.760]   some big danger zones.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.360]   Number one, the biggest expense that most of us will face in our life is taxes.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.820]   Now taxes for the common man, which is what my approach is in this show, taxes are not
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.720]   particularly complicated.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.440]   I'm going to assume for the purposes of this series that you are just simply working a
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.580]   job.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.080]   As such, you're going to have employment taxes and you're going to have a certain level of
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.800]   income taxes.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.120]   Here's all you need to do to save on your income taxes.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.560]   That's it.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.140]   Because most of the time, people who are earning a common man wage don't actually have that
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.680]   much in income taxes.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   So you can just move right on past that category for right now and focus on something else.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   Now if you are a six figure or multi six figure earner, then yes, you need to pay more attention
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.600]   to tax planning.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.560]   But the average tax liability on somebody earning 50, $80,000 is very reasonable.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.660]   Now if you didn't like my suggestion of, then let's move past it and here's the simple thing.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.960]   Just put money in your 401k.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.120]   If you don't have a 401k, put money in an IRA, fund one for you, fund one for your spouse.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.560]   It's as simple as that.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.120]   If you'll just put money in your 401k, you'll lower your income tax liability by a very
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.560]   reasonable amount and you'll have money down the road.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.440]   It's very simple.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.320]   Most people don't need anything more than that.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.900]   Now what's the next big category?
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.960]   The biggest expense that most people have is housing.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.800]   Here is all you need to know with regard to housing.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:15.760]   Just choose a modest, comfortable house that's well built, buy it, finance it with a long
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.960]   term fixed rate mortgage and live in it for as long as you can possibly make happen.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.040]   If you'll do that, everything will work out.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.520]   The big errors here that most people make, the stupid things that they do, is one, they
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.680]   buy way more house than they can afford.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.480]   And because your house is a driver of many other levels of expenses, they automatically
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.120]   put themselves into stupid camp.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.160]   Here's why.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.280]   Your house will dictate the kind of car that you drive.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.480]   If you live in a modest neighborhood, then a modest car will not seem out of place.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.160]   But if you live in a ritzy, glitzy neighborhood, a modest car will seem out of place.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.400]   You can hide it in the garage, but most people will, in time, wind up putting themselves
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.240]   into a situation where they upgrade their car.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.080]   If you live in a modest neighborhood, in a modest house, chances are that your neighbors
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.960]   will probably be fairly modest in their financial doings, which means you're more likely to
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.760]   be invited to go on a picnic, or to go out in the boat this weekend, or go down to the
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.440]   lake, which are very modest ways of enjoying your entertainment for the weekend.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   If you live in a ritzy, glitzy neighborhood, you're more likely to receive invitations
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.680]   to go snow skiing out in Vail for the week.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.520]   I like snow skiing in Vail, but it's hard to get away from a week of snow skiing for
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.040]   less than $5,000 for a couple.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.000]   So your house drives many of your expenses.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.380]   Your house purchase price also drives many of the internal expenses for your house.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:01.240]   If your house is relatively modest, you can staff it, or fill it, with appropriate, high-quality,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.960]   but modest appliances.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.080]   But if your house is very ritzy, your modest appliances will seem very out of place.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.040]   If your house is modest, then you can treat it with modest landscaping that you can maintain
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.200]   yourself.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.760]   But if your house is ritzy, your modest landscaping starts to look out of place, and now all of
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.600]   a sudden you have to hire a gardener to take care of things.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.720]   The simple decision on your house and your housing will drive almost every other category
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.160]   of your budget.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.320]   So just choose something modest.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.600]   Now you don't have to live down in a van down by the river.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.000]   Just choose a modest neighborhood with modest homes.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.720]   Buy a quality home.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.640]   Finance it with a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage if you don't have the cash to pay for it.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.960]   If you'll just have a mortgage and pay it off, you'll own a house.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.440]   In the United States of America, a huge percentage—I'm grasping for the exact data, look me up, but
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.840]   my gut says it's like 30 to 40 percent—so a huge percentage of houses are owned debt-free.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.400]   Just say a third.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.140]   Most of the time those houses are owned not because somebody did some weird radical strategy
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.680]   of building it themselves or living in an igloo because they could build it cheap.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.440]   Rather, they just bought a house, paid it off, made some extra payments here and there.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.840]   It's not hard on a working man, common man's salary to take out a 30-year mortgage and
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.160]   pay it off in 18.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.200]   Just requires some extra payments here and there.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.480]   Requires some disciplined choices to go ahead and put extra money towards the mortgage instead
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   of spending it.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.400]   So control your house.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.360]   Move as infrequently as possible.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.840]   Moving is expensive.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.040]   It's expensive to sell a house.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.860]   It's expensive to buy a house.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.840]   It's expensive in time and it's expensive in money.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.740]   It's expensive because whenever you buy a house, you're going to have to fix a bunch
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.720]   of stuff that you didn't know about when you did your inspection.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.480]   When you buy the house, you're going to have to decorate it.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.800]   You're going to have to furnish it.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.040]   The actual physical costs of moving are not insubstantial.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.460]   So focus on just moving as little as possible.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.320]   If you'll live a stable lifestyle and buy a home in a modest, comfortable, suburban
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:30.080]   neighborhood and stay there a long time, you will naturally wind up with a paid-for house
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.840]   and relatively low living expenses.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   That's sufficient.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.760]   You don't have to be a genius.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   Now let's move on to vehicles, the number three category that most people spend a lot
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.920]   of money in.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.600]   I think it's wonderful if you would like to get rid of your car and ride a bicycle full
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   time.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.880]   That is awesome and it will save you a ton of money.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.440]   But you know what?
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.120]   You don't have to.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.020]   I think it's super cool.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.080]   If you want to buy a $2,000 car, drive it for five years and sell it for $2,000.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.080]   But you know what?
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.560]   You don't have to.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.760]   You can go and buy a new car.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.320]   You can finance said new car.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.220]   But here's what you can't do if you want to be wealthy.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.920]   You can't buy a new car and finance a new car every three years.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.720]   And you can't buy a new fancy car and finance a new fancy car that goes down in value every
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.400]   three years.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.820]   But you don't have to buy used cars.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.280]   You don't have to ride bicycles or motorcycles or scooters.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.600]   All those things are cool.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.420]   Here's what you need to do at the very least.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.600]   Don't be stupid.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.120]   If you're going to buy a new car, choose a quality car.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   Do your shopping first in the Consumer Reports guides rather than on the local showroom floor
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.880]   and choose quality over flashiness.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.760]   If you'll choose a quality car, even if you buy it new and you finance it, that car should
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.120]   last you for a long time.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.460]   Think carefully about your needs and your future needs so that you don't have to automatically
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.640]   change cars in three years because you were short-sighted or stupid and you bought a two-door
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.480]   car when you were pregnant with a baby.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   That didn't work.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.760]   That wasn't a good plan.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.320]   So go ahead and buy a new car if that's what you need, but buy a carefully chosen, reasonable
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.600]   car, and keep it for a very long time.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.460]   If you buy a new car and keep it for 20 years, there is almost no meaningful difference between
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.860]   the impact of your buying a new car versus the three-year-old car.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.120]   Even if you financed it, it was paid off for 15 years.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:54.760]   Just buy a nice car that's reasonable and keep it for a very long time.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.000]   That's simple.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.800]   That's doable.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.120]   Now what other expenses?
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:05.880]   Well, from here, you need to think carefully about the other big budget items in your life,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.480]   and these budget items will be unique to you.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.080]   For some people, you'll need to consider the cost of private schooling.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.280]   Other people, you'll need to just simply control a little bit of the cost of your vacations
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.400]   or your hobbies.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.960]   But you can still go on vacations.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.520]   You can still have great hobbies and save a lot of money.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.280]   Just think a little bit modestly.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.880]   Don't reach and stretch for the second beach house.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.960]   Just go and stay at a hotel on the beach for a week.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.280]   Don't reach and stretch for the big giant RV.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.000]   Just buy a simple pop-up and use it.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.080]   Don't reach and stretch for the huge boat.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.120]   Just buy the modest boat.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.480]   If you'll do the simple things like that, you can keep your expenses down while also
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.200]   maintaining an entirely comfortable and sufficient lifestyle, and you can become financially
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.320]   independent in a reasonable amount of time.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:13.280]   You don't have to be smart to become financially independent, but you can't be stupid.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.360]   So don't be stupid.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.480]   If you're not into the radical weird stuff, live the normal approach to life.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:28.840]   Just don't be stupid with your expenses.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   Thank you for listening.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.040]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.880]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.600]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.000]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.720]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.760]   action on it.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.160]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.520]   to a life change.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.520]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.160]   So take action.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.840]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.400]   that you care about.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.600]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.080]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.920]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:36.680]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.040]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.760]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.400]   this work voluntarily.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.640]   Come by RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and you can sign up there to support the show
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.880]   at whatever level you feel is right for you.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.640]   This is a voluntary support.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.280]   That's my Patreon page.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.320]   You can support me with a dollar a month, $5 a month, $10 a month, any number that seems
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   right to you.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.200]   But if you're gaining financial benefit from this show, and if it's achieving financial
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.560]   results in your life, I'd be grateful for your financial support at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
