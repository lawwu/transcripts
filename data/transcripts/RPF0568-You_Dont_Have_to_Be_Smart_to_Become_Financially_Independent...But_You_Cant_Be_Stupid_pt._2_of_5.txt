[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:42.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:52.700]   My name is Joshua. I am your host, and today we continue with part two of my series, "You Don't Have to Be Smart to Become Financially Independent, But You Can't Be Stupid."
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.200]   And today we talk about expenses.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.320]   This series is organized around my framework for wealth.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:27.360]  , part one was increase income.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:57.400]  , part two was increase income.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:26.300]   build
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.560]   Most of the time, people who are earning a common man wage don't actually have that much in income taxes.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.120]   So you can just move right on past that category for right now and focus on something else.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.980]   Now, if you are a six-figure or multi-six-figure earner, then yes, you need to pay more attention to tax planning.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.980]   But the average tax liability on somebody earning $50,000, $80,000 is very reasonable.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.120]   Now, if you didn't like my suggestion of,

[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:41.480]   In the United States of America, a huge percentage... I, I, I, I'm grasping for the exact data, look me up, but my gut says it's like 30 to 40%. So a huge percentage of houses are owned debt-free, just say a third. Most of the time, those houses are owned not because somebody did some weird, radical thing, but because they're owned by a group of people.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:07:09.420]  , because they're owned by a group of people.

[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.520]   a little bit modestly. You need to think carefully about the other big budget items in your life and these budget items will be unique to you. For some people, you'll need to consider the cost of private schooling. Other people, you'll need to just simply control a little bit of the cost of your vacations or your hobbies. But you can still go on vacations. You can still have great hobbies and save a lot of money. Just think a little bit modestly.
