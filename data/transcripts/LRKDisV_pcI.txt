[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   Sorry, everybody. I wasn't here last week. So what's your bit Jake? I'll jump into your bit. No, there's no bit. I'm just I'm
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.520]   You know triple vax. I take the packs a little bit and I'm back everybody. I know everybody was very concerned about me
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.740]   Thank you to everybody, but I can take my mask off right free bird. Do I need a mask in 2024? You're good. You're clear
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.360]   Okay, so let me take one of these off
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.120]   Okay, you know what I'll take the third mascot totally free no mask free
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.080]   I hope I don't get you this easy says we can treat kovat like the flu now
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.780]   I mean you see that finally a minute after two years of shutting down schools the economy everything like oh, it's just the flu
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.880]   Well, it's interesting, you know, I got the coded just to explain to everybody I went to Billy Joel's
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.840]   Final concert with my daughter. She we had a great time
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.160]   It was his final MSG Nick time stamp the end of it. So everybody can just skip to the end of the gun
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.800]   Sorry, go ahead Jason. There's no bit here
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.040]   I'm just saying I'm letting people know that I think I got covered at the last Billy Joel shows a great show
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.360]   Shout out Billy Joel
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.680]   But it was 48 hours that were very intense and then I took that pack slow of it and I came right out of it
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.920]   But so apologies to everybody but man, it was no joke
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.680]   Yeah, great story. Great story. Great story
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.720]   Earlier today, did you guys? Oh my god. Yeah, the Olympics happened
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.040]   I know you guys taking the Olympics at all free bird
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.080]   You seem like a guy who would watch obscure Olympic sports. I think there's a lot of sports. That should be regular
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.800]   It's like the pistol shooting guy. Anyway, it's all moot because you know
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.920]   The paparazzi were there and they took poke pictures trim off
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   Do you know this big paparazzi in Paris this year because of all the celebrities there and the pops are all over the place in
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.400]   Europe they're everywhere. They're everywhere. I'm sure you saw them in Italy. It's it's getting crazy. But um
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.160]   They got you when you were getting your gold medal Nick pull it up. This is this was I think in a sweetly here
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.440]   It is here. Here's Chamath getting his gold medal. Okay. Oops
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.920]   Whoa, now this this is in the category of being the biggest prick now just let people know
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.320]   Chamath has
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:17.900]   Other people were there too, by the way, it wasn't it wasn't just Chamath free bird was also there. Here's his free bird
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.040]   Yeah, most likely to fight a girl. Yeah, there it is. He was in the am I the Syrian?
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.680]   I
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.920]   Yes, that's you in the women's category of boxing the women's boxing, right? Thank you. Yeah, he's out June. Thank you
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.900]   Jacob Sachs was there too, though. By the way, here he is. He he won silver for the
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.840]   Very least the ozempic and we'll go but you lost the weight, but you didn't get any muscle definition
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.660]   That's a known that's known right free bird. It's known you lose the muscle, right? That's right. You didn't fat and the muscle
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.160]   I was there too, by the way, and I'm very very proud to say
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.700]   I in a photo finish you can see me there
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.980]   Guys know this one, right? This is the hundred meter virtue signal. So you see there
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.400]   Edge me out and I'm right ahead of Paul Graham. So we
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.800]   signaling
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.440]   100 meter - it was pretty great. It's pretty grand
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.400]   But congrats to read Hoffman also coming on the pod to debate you sex hard to beat them in virtue signaling
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   I know I felt like hard. I felt like sober in this case was a goal, you know
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.480]   Given the competition, right? You just if you meddle in that group of her
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:49.820]   All right, everybody welcome back to the all-in podcast, of course the number one podcast in the world and
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.440]   I'm back. Daddy's home and we've got a very full docket
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.160]   Saks will get his red meat at the end for all the maga lunatics in the comments. Don't worry
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.960]   He's gonna get his red meat, but we got bigger fish to fry in the markets markets
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.140]   We're down big on Monday due to something called the yen carry trade
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.880]   The Dow is down 700 points now. It was down like 6%
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.480]   It was unsettling social media went crazy on Sunday night that it was gonna be the end of the world the beginning of a recession
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.380]   Maybe a depression and this all happened because Japan's Central Bank raised their interest rates by a whopping
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.040]   15 to 25 basis points and we'll explain why that's important in just a moment
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.000]   We'll get you mop to give us a little overview here of the yen carry trade
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.980]   But this is a big deal because Japan has had its interest rates at near zero even negative since 1999
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.360]   so this little blip on the chart is
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.440]   You know the interest rate going up
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.560]   Yeah, they're in Japan. So quick explainer and then Chamath will have you go deeper. The yen carry trade is a pretty
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.000]   Basic concept investors borrow at 0% interest or close to it due to this 0% interest rate
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and then you convert your yen into another currency or perhaps a stock like Nvidia and you take the spread so
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.720]   You know, the goal is obviously to return a higher rate than the cost of borrowing the yen
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.520]   And so here's an example of it. If you just want to look at the flow you borrow some yen at 0% you invest it
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.360]   in stocks, whatever
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.240]   You get some appreciation and then you liquidate the stocks and you pay back your bill. Of course this can all go horribly
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.600]   Yeah, but it's a safer way to do. This is just to invest in a US T bill. That's paying 5%
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.640]   Yeah
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.200]   Yeah, so you have you borrow it you borrow yen at 0% invest in T bills at 5% and you pocket the difference
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.000]   Yeah, you just have to pay back the loan. Of course Chamath this can all go very wrong if a number of things happen
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.400]   So maybe you could give us an overview of this kind of trade. Have you ever done something like this?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.840]   What do you think of these type of trades these?
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.080]   What unquote free money trades, you know picking up free money off the ground
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   trades I
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.760]   mean, I think
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.880]   These kinds of things so I've never done them and part of the reason why is I think these things
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.840]   Look genius and they work until one
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:20.400]   Moment in time where they stop working and it stops working so severely that it becomes almost impossible to unwind yourself
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.760]   And so you plan on hiding. Yeah
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.680]   Yeah, so I think typically in these situations the thing you have to remember is you don't really make a lot of money in
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.840]   This trade the way you make a lot of money is by leveraging this trade up
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.740]   So meaning it's not like borrowing a million
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.480]   Dollars in yen and then swapping it to US dollars and then putting it in t-bills is a real money maker
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.800]   You're talking about 50k. That's not really gonna move the needle
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   So what people try to do in these situations is do it on a billion dollars and then lever it up 5 or 10 X
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.240]   the problem with that is that you're posting all kinds of collateral as
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.480]   Margin to these banks to give you that leverage because then all of a sudden
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.120]   capturing
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.240]   150 basis points on 10 billion or 15 billion now, we're talking about real money and
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.320]   So when these things go wrong and they happen very suddenly
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.920]   what it does is it puts pressure on all other asset classes because people are scrambling to make sure that they don't get margined out and
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:35.280]   What you saw over the weekend was it mostly a lot of that happening, which was a lot of these folks
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:43.520]   Were putting this trade on to the tune of tens or probably even a hundred billion plus dollars Wow
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.120]   of which they had maybe five or ten billion of equity and
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:54.680]   Eighty to ninety billion dollars of just margin and that's what caused this very quick
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.280]   cycle
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.720]   Hmm, then it looked like it unraveled itself. And so people thought oh, we're probably mostly past this
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.760]   I actually think we're not I've said this before
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.680]   I think one of the most interesting things I've learned in the last few years about the stock market is
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.080]   The stock market is owned
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.080]   By and large by these algos right meaning there is these large
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.680]   Kind of murky grayish hedge funds that have these computer trading algorithms
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:31.880]   That are allowed to be levered to the tune of you know, 13 15 20 times
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.400]   About 50 billion dollars. So these folks are swinging around a trillion dollars each
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.960]   okay, and
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.840]   we all just live in their world because when these algorithms make a decision and
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.640]   They react to these kinds of events. That's when the real volatility
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.560]   Starts, so I think the most important thing was summarized by friends of ours
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.200]   From Goldman Sachs. I just want to Nick if you want to just throw up the picture that they sent me
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.640]   so they sent they sent some really good market insights whenever these things kind of happened to a bunch of their clients and
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.040]   One of the interesting things that they observed is a couple of facts
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:19.840]   The first is the algorithms in the middle of all of this chaos sold about 41 billion dollars of global equities
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.280]   Okay, no big deal
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.760]   Except that it actually causes everybody else to have to react and then they sell billions and billions more
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.920]   The other thing that they noticed though, is that there we're in a moment in time
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.640]   Where you can see?
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.880]   how these algorithms will behave over the next month and
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.200]   Right now if there's relatively minimal volatility and not much changes
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.720]   The algorithms will have to sell another hundred and sixty odd billion dollars of equity and
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:59.000]   That'll pull through many hundred billions more from everybody else. So I think we're in a little bit of a delicate moment where
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.120]   the preponderance of the market action will be to continue to sell and
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:10.400]   I think it's just going to be when we look back in hindsight another reason why getting levered on these things is very dangerous
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.240]   There's no free money, basically. Yeah, there is no free money in this free money trade and just to
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.480]   Translate a little bit of this on the margins for the audience who's not familiar with it
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.680]   Margin is a loan fancy way of saying a loan margin call. You have some asset that backs it up
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.120]   You know in your case, it might be, you know, a civilian and it might be your house
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.280]   Whatever your bank account in these cases these big companies and these hedge funds might have cash or equities
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.280]   And if they come down and they have to pay the loan
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.120]   They are forced to liquidate it and in some cases
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.040]   Those assets are controlled by the person giving the loan and they will just starts
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.400]   Programmatically selling your shares and whatever Apple Google whatever you're in video
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.840]   you are you own to pay down that margin and this is called a margin called thus the name of the
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.520]   movie and so it's incredibly dangerous and the leverage is
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   You and I can or like any civilian could borrow, you know
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.520]   $500,000 against their two million dollar house and home equity rich people and these big banks
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.080]   They can borrow 10 or 20 times the value of the assets which then could lead to
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:23.220]   Absolute chaos Friberg. Let's go to you next and just talk a little bit about what's going on in Japan because
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.720]   They have had a rush of people buying their stocks the population declining. It's a very
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.240]   unique
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   Economy, maybe you could talk a little bit about it
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:41.320]   One of the biggest challenges facing Japan is the level of debt that they've accrued their debt to GDP ratio is currently
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.120]   263 percent they have about
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.360]   1.3 quadrillion yen
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   of public debt on
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.160]   an annual GDP of about five hundred ninety one trillion yen
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.880]   They're currently at the federal level
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.120]   Spending about 20% of GDP per year
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:06.880]   five percent of GDP is being spent per year just on servicing the existing debt and
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.720]   That's at interest rates set by the central bank of roughly zero percent
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.860]   So, you know or whatever the market is trading it at so slightly above zero percent
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:22.120]   But if the central bank had to start to raise rates because inflation started to run away because there's so much
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.580]   Yen in circulation. There's so much debt outstanding. The federal government would not be able to actually service this debt
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:35.040]   so as of March of 2024 the Bank of Japan the central bank actually holds fifty three percent of
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.760]   Japan's outstanding government bonds
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.640]   Which is equal to about a hundred percent of Japan's GDP. So their central bank has bought the debt
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.720]   that's being issued by the federal government to fund their budget a
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:55.400]   Large chunk of which right now is being spent just on paying the interest on the debt while interest rates are close to zero percent
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.440]   So imagine if interest rates bumped up to one two, three, four five percent as we're seeing with US Treasuries
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.560]   We were recently at a nearly five percent handle on the on the 10-year Treasury
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:12.240]   It would become an unsustainable debt burden for the Japanese government to be able to handle that and a large part of this is being
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.880]   driven by a number of crises that
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:21.560]   Japan has faced since the early 90s. So there was the financial crisis in a way there was the nuclear
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.240]   Meltdown there was a couple of earthquakes tsunamis and a lot of debt has been taken on to support
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:33.080]   the country after those crises, but really importantly and Nick if you could just pull up this age chart is
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.880]   the aging of the Japanese population
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:42.440]   So this chart shows that and you can kind of see back to 1950 when the average age in Japan was 21 years old
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.480]   And today the average age in Japan is around 48
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   You know in the next decade, it'll be 50 then it'll be 52
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.000]   So that means more and more people are relying on public pension today
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.960]   80% of their government spending goes towards their social security programs in the US for comparison Social Security is about 20% of federal
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.000]   Spending so that number is only getting bigger and bigger as the population ages
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.080]   The Japanese government has to continue to service their older population and they've had to face several crises
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.720]   Their debt has ballooned to a level that is well beyond any other industrialized nation
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:24.200]   And the only way to continue to service that debt economically is to keep interest rates low and the problem with keeping interest rate low
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:32.480]   Inflation and that's the big driver that caused them to say let's uptake the interest by 15 bips or 25 bips is to try and tackle
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.400]   The inflation problem they're facing just like our central bank recently tried to do the same
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.040]   But clearly the market can't have it
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   so Japan isn't a real pickle and
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.160]   I think that it shows how much
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:49.840]   having a large amount of federal debt can impact the ability for a nation to maneuver itself during difficult times and
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   ultimately debt payments come due they come to you either in the form of economic contraction or
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.240]   Massive taxes or inflation and currently Japan is paying for it in terms of inflation
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.560]   Sorry, you're saying Japan has inflation Japan is no inflation the government raised rates to tackle inflation
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:15.840]   I'll pull up the inflation chart. Japan's inflation hit a 40-year high and this just shot up in the last 18 months
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   Inflation is running at close to 4% a year. And so they're setting Friedberg
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:30.120]   The interest rate in the country and they own the debt. So they are basically in control of or
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.840]   They're manipulating the economy and trying to control it, correct Friedberg
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.680]   Well, their central bank has to buy most of the debt and their central bank sets the rates
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.400]   So they have a large amount 50, you know, 53 percent of their federal of their public debt
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.680]   It's held by their central bank
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:50.120]   And if they don't pay a high interest rate, then people don't buy future bonds if they do raise it
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.440]   They have to pay that rate. So this is the conundrum Friedberg if I were to summarize it
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:01.560]   Well, yeah while rates are low you see this, you know, particularly in a market like we're facing today where there's global inflation
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:08.620]   They need to raise rates in order to reduce inflation. The problem with raising rates is this this, you know, this currency problem
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.240]   But also buying the debt Chamath is you know, who's buying debt if you're not getting anything on the coupon, correct?
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.680]   that's another challenge they face in Japan is that
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.080]   There's a famous quote from an economist. I mean Kuznets who said there's four kinds of countries in the world
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.740]   There's developed countries undeveloped countries Japan and Argentina
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:34.560]   And I think the reason he said that is that just Japan has been in this state since the 90s
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.800]   so they had a massive property and equity bubble collapse and
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   They've not had to deal
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:47.800]   With anything that look like typical economic issues since then and part of it is because the government plays a very big hand in
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.240]   The Japanese economy. There's a lot of price controls there. So, I don't know
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.280]   I'm not sure what it is that we can learn there that you can extrapolate to the rest of the world
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.560]   Yeah, it is a very unique sax
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.520]   Geography and economy so sacks your thoughts on this overall and what we can expect
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.120]   Maybe you could take the future looking forward looking and prediction crystal ball
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.480]   Good, so I think free burger is right that the reason why the Japanese Central Bank tried to raise rates
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.040]   I mean just by a tiny amount was because they are dealing with inflation if you look at that inflation chart and you go back
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.880]   To when their inflation was zero roughly in 2020 the exchange
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.960]   Ratio between the US dollar and the yen was about a hundred to one meaning one US dollar could buy a hundred yen now
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:39.040]   It's at roughly 150 yen to the dollar. So their currency has massively depreciated over the last several years
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:47.120]   And a big part of the reason why is because again their central bank is offering roughly zero and you can earn 5% in
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.480]   UST bills so people are basically
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.680]   Moving their money to countries that pay a lot more on their bonds and they're even borrowing yen. Like we talked about
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.040]   Selling the yen to then buy Australian dollars or US dollars to invest money there
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:10.760]   so there's huge downward pressure on the value of the yen and the way this creates inflation is that
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:19.040]   Japan is a is obviously an island that has very few natural resources and it has to import all of its oil
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.080]   so it has an advanced economy, but it needs to import a lot of resources and
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:30.760]   So as its currency depreciates the price of all those commodities goes up and this is why you're seeing inflation in Japan
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:37.240]   Now when the central bank tried to solve this it created huge jitters in the financial market because it was starting to unwind the whole
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.280]   Yen carry trade which is something like 20 trillion dollars
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:48.200]   And so the the Bank of Japan backed off and you heard the the Japanese central banker said we can't raise rates
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.840]   While it would create instability in the global markets
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.200]   We have to wait until it's stable
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.880]   But the problem is that raising the rates and unwinding the yen carry trade creates the instability
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.320]   So what they're saying is we're never gonna be able to raise rates
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.640]   And the result of this is going to be more inflation in Japan
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.040]   Their currency is going to continue to depreciate, you know, they've been unable to defend it
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.840]   And so what I would expect is that US dollars gonna keep buying more yen
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.960]   It's gonna go from I don't know hundred and forty seven hundred fifty. There is one some bigger some bigger number
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.080]   It's one huge upside to the sacks and who's gonna pay the price here is the Japanese consumer?
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.320]   Because everything's gonna cost a lot more
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:36.840]   Yeah, and that was you know, obviously when the when you get a hundred and fifty eight yen to the dollar
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.280]   this is extraordinary I was talking with Tucker and we just took our
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.940]   Niseko ski trip this year from four days to seven because it is just such a great deal
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.320]   It'll be good for tourism because yeah, you'll be able to travel to Japan much more cheaply
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.040]   But if you're if you're actually Japanese and you live in that country, you're gonna see your purchasing power continue to erode
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:03.800]   So I would expect big domestic problems in Japan and eventually they may conclude that this system does not benefit them
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.640]   Now who does it benefit you could argue that it benefits the United States because it has
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.040]   subsidized
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.040]   the purchase of our debt
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.720]   right because again
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:21.440]   So do you have this yen carry trade of 20 trillion and a lot of that has gone into US bonds or US T bills?
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:28.440]   Right, and so it basically is a huge subsidy to the US Treasury's
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   Need to continuously issue more and more debt. We're issuing what a trillion dollars of net new debt every 100 days
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.360]   So having the Japanese consumer subsidize all of this by taking it on the chin
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:48.040]   you know in terms of inflation or to provide this yen carry trade you could argue has been very beneficial to the US Treasury and
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.480]   Chamath at some point the you know, the
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.640]   percentage of
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.960]   Your debt to GDP, you know, we've talked about it so much on this show
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.320]   You've said previously. Hey, you know, we can have a little bit of this because we're a very strong dollar
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:08.040]   So when you look at Japan, is there some lesson here for the US or you know, maybe some
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.320]   Warning here that we we shouldn't necessarily follow them too far down this road
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.520]   Nope
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.600]   Okay, keep printing money got it, okay
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.160]   I don't know
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:24.680]   I mean, I tend to agree with Freeberg here that when you have massive amounts of debt, it definitely limits your flexibility
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:31.600]   It's just arithmetic. You're gonna pay for it with either economic contraction higher taxes or inflation. Those are the three places it goes
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.200]   Yeah, I mean and they did test it. They've stressed it now. Yeah, one of the reasons why
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.880]   Japan can't raise rates is because
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.520]   Their debt will become even more expensive
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.400]   Right. I mean free burgers in that part of the problem
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.480]   Yeah
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.200]   That's exactly right. And then their federal spending gets compressed because now they have to service that debt again
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:00.600]   They're already spending 25% of their federal budget on servicing existing debt with the low interest rates and they've got to support an aging population
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.400]   Okay, so so to analogize this the US what our our debt service costs or what?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.120]   What are they at now like well over a trillion? We're about a trillion a year with a proposed 7.3 trillion budget
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   so we're at 13.6 percent and
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.840]   Japan also
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:23.520]   over the next 10 years isn't our debt service supposed to rise - yeah as all of the as all of the low interest bonds mature
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.920]   And we issue new debt at a higher interest rate. Our debt service cost is going to continue to climb
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.000]   It's already higher than discretionary military spending it over a trillion a year
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.840]   Well just by Bitcoin and when it goes to a million dollars a coin we can just pay it all down
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.720]   So problem solved just one other point is I think it shows
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.360]   the fragility of the global financial system, I mean
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:51.040]   The market snapped back as soon as the the Bank of Japan backed off basically capitulated said, okay fine. We can't
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.000]   We can't defend our currency. We're just gonna let it keep depreciating
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.440]   We're gonna let inflation keep raging as soon as they declared that then the market snapped back
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.600]   But it just showed in that 24 hours putting aside like all the panic porn that was on social media
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.280]   So I think that was overdone
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.880]   It still showed how fragile the global economy is the the yen carry trade
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.520]   Has injected roughly 20 trillion dollars of liquidity into the global economy and that is
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:23.160]   propping up all sorts of things right and that is subsidizing US government debt and you just wonder if
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:31.720]   The yen carry trade were to end because let's say for example that Japanese people don't want to experience hyperinflation
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.320]   Then what would that do to the global economy? It just showed how rickety the whole system is
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.260]   I think it shows how much leverage there isn't this is totally that's what it is. It's all about leverage
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.360]   Okay, let's talk about leverage for a section trim up leverage on leverage on leverage
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.120]   so for example, like if you take something like
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.720]   Citadel runs about 50 billion dollars and they have
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.280]   Extremely precise risk management systems. They're the best in the business
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   but as a result of that they are so systematically important to make the
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:10.000]   Financial machinery run properly that as they're inspected and as they prove that they have very good risk management
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.600]   They're allowed to lever up to incredible levels, you know, 15 16 17 times
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.400]   So I think that Citadel with the 50 billion of capital that it investors have given them
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.840]   It's probably running a trillion dollars on a daily basis in the markets
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.000]   Renaissance technologies same situation
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.520]   Millennium same situation a bunch of these funds that sit inside of the large banks same situation
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.880]   So when you add it all up, you're probably talking about a few hundred billion dollars of notional capital
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.360]   That's enormously levered. That's what causes the
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.760]   That sensation as SAC said that things are rich
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.160]   So should we have more increased regulation or increased scrutiny on this Chamath?
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:58.640]   You've talked about it before when we had some of these hedge funds flip and we talked about maybe some regulation. Yeah
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.280]   We have a lot of regulation on banks
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.620]   Essentially what happened is after all of the chaos of the great financial crisis
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.240]   The thing that we don't talk about is what we really did was keep running the same if not more risk
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   We just took it off balance sheet. So the banks were able to structure business lines
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.320]   to work with these hedge funds and these hedge funds in turn
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:27.840]   Were able to show over time that they're so tightly managed that there are no black swan events that could happen
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   That they can run highly levered. So I think we are in this
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.880]   moment where
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.520]   They'll be these fissures from time to time. So here's this bill Hwang
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:48.800]   That's an example. The carry trade is another example. There have been examples a couple times a year, but at some point
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.280]   these folks will have taken too much risk and
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:59.760]   We'll look back on it and we'll think that hedge funds should probably have been more regulated than they are with respect to their
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.520]   Leverage ratios not with respect to their strategies with this particular trade JP Morgan
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.620]   yesterday or a few hours ago said that they think about
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:15.160]   75% of the yen carry trades have now been unwound and it was at 50% a little over a day ago
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:21.440]   so the market has moved to kind of unwind these trades it seems and we're pretty much at the end of
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.760]   the levered fallout of
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:32.280]   This particular activity. So I put the link and so people at home understand when we move on to the to the next phase
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.480]   Of the financial markets all of those people had to cover those trades
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.840]   Which means they all have to sell assets at the same time as buying in or covering the end and that's what causes this acute
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.240]   Chaos in the markets where you saw the Nasdaq go down six percent or in some cases
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.920]   Maybe people wanted to take some chips off the table since things were
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.720]   That trade back on in fact now
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.320]   I mean better time to put that trade on because the Bank of Japan's basically just capitulated and said
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.080]   That they can't raise interest rates while things are so unstable
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.160]   So we know they're just gonna keep rates where they are. So if I was one of these traders, I'd trade back on now
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.240]   So, let's talk about the landing here in the u.s
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.600]   Let's get you a centric now and it looks like maybe it's gonna be a bumpy landing rather than a soft
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.080]   Landing as one might suspect and as we talked about here that we think this could be bumpy to soft
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.760]   July's job reports was pretty bad, which is good in some ways when you're thinking about inflation
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.400]   so the new jobs added were way down growing 114,000 in July and
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:43.960]   a bunch of these estimates have been reported downward over the past year just so we make a note of that and this was below
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.040]   The Dow Jones estimate of 185,000. There's your chart. It just keeps ticking down
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:56.040]   You know since the Fed started hiking rates and you hear anecdotally about all of your friends
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.920]   88% of Millennials right now are actually preparing to be laid off
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.240]   according to a recent survey unemployment is
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.720]   way up
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:13.080]   In the short term here. We're at 4.3 percent in July. That's the highest since October of 2021 up from 4.1 percent
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:20.000]   Last month and 3.5 percent in July. So you take that July number two now, it's pretty significant. Here's your chart
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.800]   On the jobs, obviously historically it's low, but it's ticking up pretty quickly
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:32.520]   Which is what you would expect with the rate hikes and we had this great moment of hourly earnings growth going up
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.480]   So how much people make on average?
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:41.520]   Per hour was going up and I think that was causing a decent amount of the consumer enthusiasm in the economy here
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.560]   it is it's coming way down from almost six percent down to three and a half and
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.000]   So that means Fed rate cuts are coming
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.840]   Here's your chart from
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:59.480]   prediction market of the chances of how much the Fed cuts rates this year
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:06.860]   Looks like 75 to 100 basis points is the majority about 60% of people believe will be one of those two numbers
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.040]   I'll stop there
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.060]   There's a lot more to talk about here and we'll get into specific companies and the Nasdaq
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.320]   Yeah, let me pull up this last chart before I go to you Chamath
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:21.160]   It's been a strong year for the market S&P and Nasdaq both up 11% year to date as of Thursday morning
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.160]   but obviously a massive I
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.400]   Guess do we call it a correction when it's yeah, 20% is correction territory Chamath. So
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:35.120]   Your thoughts on the wider US market and the sell-off. I think we're in a low-key recession
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.360]   so I think that we're gonna probably go through a couple of very
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:47.720]   Difficult revisions of old data the thing to remember about nonfarm payrolls isn't as much what the number is
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.520]   But if you actually look to the number of times it then gets revised
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:58.920]   The reality is that these things get revised constantly and right now we're in this trend where we are overestimating and revising down
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.780]   Saks mentioned this that that was the same with GDP
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.040]   So we are I think in a tough situation and then what you're seeing is
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.600]   folks that run very cyclical businesses are
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.100]   Telling us in very plain-spoken English that demand isn't there
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.760]   So the one that was interesting this past week Jason you mentioned Millennials
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.140]   But like Airbnb where you think all these young people are running around
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.360]   Yoloing what whatever cash they have
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.840]   Airbnb had a massive warning on demand
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:38.740]   So when I think the excess capital whether it's the steamy check or what-have-you has been exhausted
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.580]   You're now starting to see it bear out in these
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:47.400]   Cyclical businesses. I don't think the demand is there. I think we're in a recession
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.920]   it probably becomes more obvious in q3 and q4 and
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:58.840]   so Powell's going to have to cut the question is will he overreact to the pressure and
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.280]   cut 75 to 100 versus
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.040]   25 and take it slow
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   Okay, Freeberg technical definition of a recession is two quarters in a row of negative GDP
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:15.860]   We haven't had that but we're sort of bouncing along that possibility is the recession
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.840]   baked in or if they cut rates at the extent the
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:25.000]   Prediction markets are predicting and they're signaling. Do you think we have a nice rebound?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.040]   How do you feel about the overall u.s. Economy? Obviously you have to account for
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:36.920]   Inflation and government spending how much of government spending is driving economic growth?
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.160]   Today the u.s. Is proposing to spend
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:46.760]   7.3 trillion dollars next year out of 25 trillion dollar GDP
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.120]   so the u.s. Federal Government is roughly 30 percent of GDP and
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.160]   We obviously still are tackling inflation
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.520]   The real question is how much of the economy is growing?
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.200]   because of productivity gains in the
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.840]   Sector of the economy where people are making things and doing things
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.000]   versus the government using its ability to tax and borrow
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:21.360]   To drive growth in the economy by inflating numbers by pushing revenue onto businesses by pushing capital into the markets by creating
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   levered trades in the markets
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:31.520]   Using their borrowing capacity and their taxing capacity. So that's the thing. I remain concerned about. I I mentioned this last week. I remain highly
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.440]   Concerned about many sectors of the economy that are deeply challenged right now
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.160]   particularly the industrial sectors manufacturing sectors the agricultural sectors
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:46.920]   But services and software sectors where you can raise prices and you have a nice high margin business
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.680]   you can continue to to grow and and look good, but there are many parts of the
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.120]   Global economy and the u.s. Economy that are pretty challenged right now
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.760]   Saks, let's talk about
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   this soft to bumpy landing
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.960]   Consumers are definitely weakening on the low-end
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:09.760]   Airbnb and Amazon are example of bargain hunting people who are looking for discounts who want to save money with those services
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.440]   higher end services that have a bigger price tag like uber and some of the
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:20.800]   High-end retailers are showing actual growth and they're saying that consumer strong. So it was a tale of two cities
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:27.760]   During this earning season with a bunch of the high-end folks saying strong consumers on the high-end weak consumers on the low-end
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.880]   What are the chances we go into a recession and you know a second question for you?
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.240]   Elon was recently on Lex Friedman for I think eight days or something
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.960]   It was like a record podcast of how long he was on but one of the things he talked about was that he had discussed
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.440]   with Trump and
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.080]   Vivek has been very strong about this on our podcast and other places and he was a leading VP candidate of
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.160]   Making the government more efficient and radically cutting the amount of spending but there would be a reaction
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:02.480]   So does the potential GOP administration have a platform to cut costs massively or not?
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.980]   And do you think that you know, that would have been maybe?
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:12.160]   Too unpopular to sort of unveil that plan now as a presidential candidate in either party
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.480]   I don't think they have that plan specifically because I just think that you would need
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.720]   You would need a supermajority in Congress to do something like that
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.020]   And I just think that this elections can be too close regardless of who wins to provide that kind of mandate
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.220]   I mean sadly, I think we do need to get a government spending under control
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.680]   But I think it's a long-term political problem and I just think our political system doesn't have the will to fix it
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.360]   I do believe Republicans would be better than Democrats on that
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.680]   But I think that's the truth of it to go back to your first question on the state of the economy
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:48.280]   I had lunch with a very prominent investor yesterday who's very plugged in with the hedge fund community and
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.820]   He said that the sentiment shift
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:56.180]   You know, I'd say again within hedge funds professional investors public market investors
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:02.720]   had been very sudden that people were now very worried about the risk of a recession and
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.340]   And I do think that the Airbnb revenue that Chema cited is a big factor
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:16.800]   Airbnb stock went down 15% in in one day on soft demand and what's driving all this is is consumer weakness or at
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   least fear of consumer weakness
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.760]   You mentioned the rise in unemployment. It went from four point one to four point three percent
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.060]   Month over month, so four point three is still a pretty low number by historical terms
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:36.000]   But to jump so much in one month, that's a pretty big increase and then of course, it's up from three point five percent
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.680]   A year ago, so we're seeing pretty big increases in
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:46.040]   Every year five percent month over month is very significant. Yeah. Yeah, so these are big changes
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   There's real evidence of consumer weakness and I think professional investors are getting quite worried about
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:59.280]   the risk of a recession and I guess this one last point on this is that if you were to
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.480]   Remove the impact of government spending. It's pretty clear. The private sector is in a recession
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   I mean like we've been talking about government's been going hog-wild with spending we have the government is running 6% of GDP
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.440]   deficits
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:19.520]   the the latest q2 growth number was something like 2% so if you force government to live within its means and
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.820]   To cut its way back to balance. We would definitely be in a recession. We'd have a negative growth rate
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.800]   So I do think that the economy is looking pretty shaky all of a sudden
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.320]   Whether we actually tip over into recession in the next few months. I'm not sure. All right
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.600]   Well, listen, I want to corner everybody here with a question. You got to answer the question
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:43.040]   You you can't avoid the hard questions here on the all-in podcast Chamath sitting here a year from now
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:49.480]   Market up or we experience a recession defined as two quarters of negative GDP
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.680]   Which one is the more likely scenario market up or a recession?
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.400]   Give it a percentage or just which is more likely
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:03.440]   Free burger next those are not those are those are not opposing things. So you're saying a year from now
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.440]   I don't I don't honestly know
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:13.000]   Okay, but I do think that we'll probably be in a technical recession. Okay, so you lean towards logical recession
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.760]   No recession in the next year. Um, but I also think that there's a pretty decent chance. The market will be up. Ah
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:24.600]   Got it. Okay, so we could have a recession but the market goes up so to unpack that I am with you on that same
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.080]   Prediction because I do think people are addicted to efficiency
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.620]   They're gonna lay people off and earnings are gonna keep ripping as these companies become managed
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.800]   So well, that's a small percentage of the economy Jake how that's a few tech companies
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.880]   But much of the manufacturing sector the industrial sector the AG markets
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:46.040]   Like there's a lot of markets where you don't have this option to just cut knowledge workers the knowledge worker economy
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.880]   The software economy has the ability to do that the tech economy can do that
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:55.760]   But much of the rest of the economy doesn't have a lot of maneuverability like we do in this in this fast. Well
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.200]   High margin kind of industry we work in I think it's a good point
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.600]   But I do see McDonald's Starbucks and some of those consumer retailers are
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:10.680]   Taking steps right now to right-size their businesses and offer $5 meals or $3 coffee. So I do think there's a
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   Chipped in management and how they run these companies. That's about reduced forecast, right?
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.040]   So when their revenue decline when their revenue forecasts have to be cut they have to cut headcount
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.440]   That's different than creating more efficiency. Well, but they're also cutting stores and they're
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.960]   Projects that are inefficient. So I just think there's gonna be massive efficiency in all sectors
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.160]   That's gonna be the theme for the next year
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.720]   But I mean, it's obviously that's that's a lot of jobs and a loss of growth, right?
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.960]   So just to be clear when you cut stores you have less growth when you cut jobs
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   That's because you don't have as much revenue growth. So those are about but earnings can go up, right?
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.980]   They can be supported but you're still facing contraction and you know
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.460]   one of the challenges right now a lot of food companies a lot of
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:53.200]   Retail companies have been raising prices to try and keep earnings going up
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.660]   But there's hitting this natural inflection point where consumers no longer buy where you find this tipping point
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.520]   I don't know if you guys have been to the supermarket lately, but man, it is crazy
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:09.040]   expensive how like prices have gone up like 50 100 percent on like everything at the supermarket and
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:15.720]   This is like it's basically impossible. We could deal with it. But like a large percentage of people
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.240]   this is a big deal in terms of like now you have to budget your life and you spend less that and I
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:27.780]   When we're here in Portofino, we go in the morning to the fishmonger and we'll buy, you know fish for the family
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:32.400]   It is unbelievably expensive and you know, we always think to ourselves
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:38.720]   How is it possible that folks can actually choose to eat healthy and local if they want to it's not was a brand
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.720]   You know, what was the whole fish tell us?
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:48.680]   You know like if you want to have like locally caught soul it's like 48 euros a kilogram
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.280]   and like it's expensive and
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.240]   It's expensive for a restaurant
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.040]   So to feed a family of seven, which is what we are
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.760]   You'll have to spend you know, 150 200 dollars. It's not sustainable. It's not
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:12.880]   Something that can that make sense for enough people anymore because that probably used to be 40 bucks or 30 bucks
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.800]   But freeberg is right like we're in a real serious problem because it's it's like these systems have remained
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.000]   the way that they had been for a very long time and
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.480]   While other industries like the tech industry have captured all these incredible efficiencies
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.160]   but the problem is that then these other industries are what supports everyday people's everyday lives and
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.760]   In the absence of a way to actually reduce cost and improve quality
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.960]   You end up where we are today, and I don't think that that's sustainable
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.400]   Freeberg greater chance of a recession in the next year or not a recession. You have to give an answer
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.480]   Yeah, I think there's a great chance of a recession a majority chance of recession gun
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.920]   But I do think that there's gonna be
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.560]   Government programs to mitigate the effects meaning you could see the markets the equity markets continue to rally
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:09.160]   Okay on some of the government programs and government activity, which has become kind of like the learned behavior
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.400]   It's like Pavlovian
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.720]   It's like we have a we have an economic problem the government step the government steps in and spends money
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.960]   Let me get an answer from Sachs
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:21.360]   The reason why the markets could rally in the midst of a recession is because interest rates get cut
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:27.960]   We've already seen that the expectations of rate cuts have now grown substantially. The markets are starting to price in a
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:35.560]   Hundred two hundred fifty basis points of rate cuts this year where before it was more like 25 to 50 basis points
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:42.160]   So obviously lower interest rates make stocks go up. So I think that's the the main driver of the rally
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:48.080]   You're seeing right now J Cal not the prospects for increased efficiency because I think you know, those prospects were already there
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.880]   So why are you majority case recession or majority case not recession in the next year?
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.760]   I've been predicting recession for like three years now because I just think when you jack up interest rates
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:02.520]   so suddenly so violently you get recession, so I guess I if I if you put me down I'd say I
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:09.200]   Recession and I'll tell you one of the reasons one of the reasons why interestingly, I've just checked the notes sacks
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   you predicted five of the
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.000]   Nine of the last five recessions. I know I know it look it's the same recession that I've been predicting
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.720]   It's very simple when you jack up interest rates from near zero to five and a half percent
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.880]   That makes everything much more expensive
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.360]   Unless the government spends money, which is in the counterbalance, right?
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.800]   And that's a lot of why governments day and and by the way, I have a theory on this
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:37.600]   I think this is also why we have an open border policy or why the current administration has pushed an open border policy
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.920]   because that can also be deflationary to counteract the effects of
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:48.000]   The interest rate accrual because it lowers wages overall and fills wages. It increases the workforce, etc
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.560]   Creates more competitive workforce, but no one's allowed to publicly say that and I do think that that's one of the primary motivating factors
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.880]   Of having an open border policy. Well people have been saying it. I think you just did
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.840]   It's well set if you look at job creation over the last four years
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:07.800]   There's been no net new job creation for native-born Americans. All the job creation has been
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.600]   Foreign-born or native-born Americans have to have a wage expectation. That's the fundamental problem, right?
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.920]   Affluent I agree. I don't think it's too high right and I'm not making an argument one way or the other
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.080]   I'm just highlighting. I think that this is one of the motivators for the policy
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   I think it'd be a lot better to let their wages rise
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.400]   But in any event, let's not get political on it just to the point about
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.440]   Recession Jason. Oh, yeah. Look I've been predicting the same recession
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.920]   But I think one of the reasons why it might finally come now
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.960]   If first of all, you've got a lot of investors are suddenly worried about it. There's been a big sentiment shift
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.440]   I think the other thing is I don't think we know all the bad news yet. Hmm. I'm known as yeah
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:50.320]   Well, none of us were tracking the end carry trade like very I mean it was something we may have heard of but it's not
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:55.760]   Like we were actively thinking about it until this past week and the question is how many more things are out there like that?
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:01.680]   And I also think that the pattern with this administration has been to hide the ball. They hid
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.200]   by insanity for years
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   Yeah, not to get political
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:25.520]   And you guys can decide if I'm just being partisan or whether I have a good point here
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:32.440]   Which is look, I think the mo of this administration has been to hide the ball and any good news
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:37.320]   They would have reported. Do you think that they're reporting all the bad news? I don't I think there's more bad news
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:42.720]   It's gonna come out after the election because there's too many incentives for people to hide it and for people who don't know we're talking
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.760]   About the concept of black swans in order to have a black swan
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.000]   it has to be
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.880]   Something you're not aware of and it has to be have a dramatic impact the yen trade would not fall into this because people were well
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.240]   Aware of it, even if it wasn't front-page news and it didn't have a dramatic impact
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.500]   But there could be black swan sitting there. Obviously the back swan that you can think of
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.800]   Recently would be in the great financial crisis the subprime mortgage
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:12.520]   that truly was massively impactful and it was not known dot-com was known and
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:18.240]   Was massively impacted you need both of those categories to define a black swan and there could be black swans, right?
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.280]   Saks is what you're saying when you said that the yen carry trade didn't have a big impact
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   That's because the Bank of Japan backed off
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.000]   So if they kept going with it, we don't know what the impact would have been
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.340]   Correct, but it didn't so just some people who are tracking the black swan tracker just the more, you know, let's talk about Apple
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:41.400]   Chamath I'll give you your flowers right now. They're coming to you. Just look to your left. Here comes a huge bouquet because
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:49.720]   You predicted I didn't actually send you flowers. He looked to his left. But here's your virtual flowers you predicted I think absolutely
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.640]   Correctly that the less
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.660]   Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett talk in their
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:06.340]   documents and their letters and at their events about a trade the more they're falling out of love with it and I
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:10.680]   Understand Berkshire Hathaway has sold half of their largest position
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.280]   Which is Apple some people are saying because they don't have faith in the company
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.560]   Some people are saying because they're over
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.680]   Weighted other people saying because they Freeberg want to get more cash on the books to make other acquisitions
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:29.440]   So Chamath you're maybe just take your victory lap and then we'll I think Freeberg double-clicked on this and did a deep dive
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.340]   I don't have much to say
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:38.440]   I mean, I think it's been a trend in their letters when he stops mentioning a company in his letter
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:44.260]   It's because he's selling it's a great great read. There it is. Yeah, and that's what happened here
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:49.200]   Okay, so Freeberg take us through this. Well, so it looks like since the start of the year
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   They've sold 55% of their holdings in Apple
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.740]   And if you look at the end of the year Nick if you could pull up this image with the pie chart
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.520]   this is what Berkshire's stock holdings were in
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:06.020]   their non majority owned businesses so businesses that they don't own the business outright and
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:10.700]   50% of their portfolio was in Apple at a hundred and seventy four billion dollars
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.120]   We obviously saw Apple's stock price peak
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.940]   Highest level ever just a few days ago
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:22.660]   But it has since come down as it was reported that since the start of the year now
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.380]   Berkshire's sold 55% of this position
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:33.260]   So some people are arguing that they've got a point of view on the company strategy and competent competitive kind of landscape
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.980]   Some folks have argued that the valuation multiple has gotten too high trading at nearly 30 times earnings
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:44.700]   The stock has risen nine hundred percent since Berkshire bought the stock in 2016 nine bagger
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:51.380]   Nicely done. Yeah, and some people would argue that the percent of the portfolio is too high at over 50% as you can see here
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.380]   at the start of the year
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.740]   But you know, I'll kind of provide some of the counter arguments, you know
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:02.420]   Warren Buffett does not do much analysis on corporate strategy when he provides reviews of the stocks that he's picked
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:07.500]   he often finds and talks a lot about great managers that generate great returns and
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.580]   He sticks with them and he sticks with them sometimes for many many decades
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:18.660]   The management in this company has not changed the return profile on cash invested in cash returned has only improved since he put money in
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.540]   They're generating more cash flow. They're offering more dividends
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:25.180]   They're doing more stock buybacks and he's happy to be concentrated over the years
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:31.540]   He's made large bets on single companies to the point that sometimes he just outright buys the entire company like he did with Geico in
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:36.740]   1996 he always talks a lot about finding a company that is run by great managers
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.940]   It has a premium product with a nice high margin and a durable moat
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:45.140]   Strong brand value as I look at kind of what's really gone on here
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:50.060]   It feels to me like the difference between Apple and some of the other big holdings in his portfolio
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.840]   Is that many of those other businesses are regulated monopolies?
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.580]   So BNSF railway is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration Berkshire energy
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:04.340]   Which owns mid American is a regulated utility the prices that they charge consumers are set by the government
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:09.340]   So they have a market that's locked in the prices are set. They have locked in distribution
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.500]   They have locked in utility value and the same is true in the insurance business
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.880]   Geico's rates are approved and set effectively by state regulators
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:23.060]   Berkshire has a moat because they've got the largest capital base and they've got this machine that just keeps generating cash and the rates are
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.180]   publicly set by government
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:31.660]   Apple however is not regulated and it is very clear that Apple is facing very deep and severe financial
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:37.020]   Impact from the regulatory authorities that are overseeing the business. So if you look at the Google antitrust, right?
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.060]   We're gonna get into the Google deal in a second
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:45.220]   Yeah, there's a real regulatory risk there because Google's paying Apple 20 billion dollars a year to be the default search engine
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.180]   Apple also has a very deep relationship with China
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.820]   They have a lot of manufacturing being done in China and they sell a lot of product into China
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:50:00.020]   So as regulators start to take a harder look as they've said they're going to at companies relationships with China. That's a real risk to Apple
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:05.020]   Advertising tracking users and then the subscription fees that are charged to consumers and most importantly
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:11.700]   We've talked a lot about the 30% vig that Apple takes on their app store and how regulators are now stepping in and take a look
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:17.740]   At this so because this business is not yet a regulated monopoly. It may be a monopoly in many senses of the word
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.260]   It's not regulated yet
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:23.500]   And that transition could be financially painful for Apple once they get to the other side
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.980]   It starts to look a lot more like a large-scale Berkshire type business
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:31.780]   So that that's my kind of summary take on what's going on with Apple. Awesome. Yeah, I don't know
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:37.780]   I think it's pretty deft sacks your thoughts on this massive increase in cash and what Berkshire Hathaway
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.460]   Is thinking what is Warren Buffett thinking here?
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:46.340]   Is it this became he became overweight Apple or that he's building up cash because the recession is coming in wants to buy things on
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.300]   the cheap
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.240]   Well or regulation to free Berks point when we had this global sell-off on
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.220]   Sunday Monday a lot of people were sharing this chart online and pointing out that
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:02.420]   Buffett was sitting on this gigantic cash pile by far the biggest cash pile that he's ever sat on we then had a market recovery
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:06.620]   so people aren't really talking about this, but it does stand to reason that
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:13.700]   Buffett is building up a war chest here and he's somewhat defensively positioned you can see that
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:20.220]   You know, it wasn't like 20 21 22 the cash pile went down because he started making a bunch of investments
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.340]   Now the cash pile is really high. So
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.980]   It seems logical to infer
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:32.920]   That he thinks that the risk reward right now is it's not great on public equities and he is
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:40.180]   Again, he's just a little bit more risk off. What do you think of the regulatory risk argument? Freeberg is floating here, Chema
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.220]   I think that David is right that freeberg is right that
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.860]   to China thing could have impacted it but
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.240]   Because he also sold a lot of BYD
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.460]   which
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:57.260]   They've owned since 2008. I think so. No, that's a Chinese EV company
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.980]   And so it could be just that that could have played a part
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:06.740]   To be honest, I don't know. So what you're saying China dependency both of those have a China dependency
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:13.500]   So he maybe felt the overall portfolio. I had too much China dependency. Maybe yeah, I could buy that that seems like reasonably logical
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.280]   I think the thing to remember though is that these decisions I
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.980]   Think have been stewing
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.500]   for at least a couple quarters
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:28.420]   Remember like, you know that letter that he writes was not written yesterday, right? That was being drafted
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:33.500]   Months and months ago. So these decisions were made or even longer
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:37.480]   So I think these decisions were made a while back
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.060]   another reason if we're gonna play kind of
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:45.240]   Conspiracy theorists is like, you know after the death of Charlie Munger
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.180]   Maybe what he's starting to do is
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:56.380]   Consolidate the book so that it can transition elegantly to Greg Abel when Buffett passes away
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:59.860]   And so that could be another
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:04.680]   When you say that you're saying he wants to hand it off with less risk in it
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.420]   So a dependency on one stock would be risk a dependency on China would be risk
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:13.380]   He wants to make it really clean. So the handoff is smoother. He wants to hand off a very organized
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:20.060]   Book or maybe he and Abel in Greg Abel have already talked about the kind of risk book that they want
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:26.940]   Over these next five to ten years and it reflects it a discussion about what the incoming CEO wants
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:34.580]   It could so there could be all kinds of reasons why I don't I don't really know I just think that
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:41.220]   Apple just back to free Berks core thesis. I agree with many of his general points
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:47.060]   I'm not sure that they affected the Berkshire strategy, but Apple is sort of a little bit wayward. It is a
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:55.300]   Company with an effective and unregulated monopoly or duopoly. That doesn't really know what to do
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:54:00.260]   And I think that that's the biggest problem with that company and that's
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:05.660]   Independent of Buffett selling now or selling a year from now or having not sold a year before
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:10.940]   Once you're regulated, you know what the prices are, you know what you can do, you know where you can go
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.460]   And all that risk is off the table
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.540]   That's what is a feature of all of those other monopolies
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:21.180]   He owns is that the government has a role in it by the way highly predictable business
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.260]   by the way, and you mentioned the Google thing, but
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:29.820]   This clearly was not part of his calculus. I think he just got very lucky
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:37.180]   But if you're holding Apple today, I think you have to take the 20 billion dollars that Google
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:45.060]   Paves you every year which comes in at 99% margin and you should probably sensitize the value of Apple
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:50.860]   We're not having that 20 billion if this antitrust ruling against Google stands
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:58.340]   Yeah, that alone could be worth upwards of half a trillion to a trillion dollars depending on what multiple you want to put on that
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:03.860]   20 well, I mean what's crazy is the Apple Apple still up to 214
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:09.020]   which is 11 12 percent higher than it was at the start of this year at
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:16.140]   185 the stock is just coming off of its all-time highs at 230 a share. So it's just barely off the all-time highs
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:21.220]   I mean, this is just an extraordinary amount of cash to be held by both Apple apples
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:26.900]   You know also has over a hundred billion in cash now Warren Buffett has close to three hundred billion
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:32.060]   Allocators want to make trades and they got a better obviously he's got a better trade
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:37.280]   I think he can make on this whether that's the 5% he's gonna get on the 300 billion or maybe there's something he wants
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:41.260]   To buy that's another possibility. So a great job wrapping this all up and
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:45.620]   let's pivot to the federal judge that ruled that Google has a
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.500]   legal monopoly in search and
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.780]   Advertising this is huge news. Perhaps
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:57.100]   This is the biggest news in the tech industry for a couple years on Monday a judge ruled that Google had acted
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:04.620]   Illegally to maintain its monopoly in online search if you remember this was filed under the Trump administration in
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:09.540]   2020 by the DOG the 277 page ruling agrees
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:15.660]   That Google abused its search business monopoly by paying billions of dollars to third-party platforms like Apple and Samsung
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:23.780]   In order to be their default search engine, so it's not just that you have the monopoly. It's how you maintain the monopoly
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.720]   This is called tack traffic acquisition cost. We've talked about it here many times according to the suit
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:35.420]   Google conducts around 90% of web searches. I think we all know that companies disputing that claim
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:40.560]   The ruling doesn't contain remedies yet for Google's behavior
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:46.300]   They're going to decide that in a subsequent ruling. Obviously Google is going to fight this it could
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.580]   Result in a change in business practices i.e. They cannot pay Firefox
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:57.500]   Samsung Apple to be the default search engine anymore that will lead to many interesting possibilities
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.340]   Chamath and I were
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.260]   discussing them on X and
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.260]   so
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:07.200]   This is huge news. This is going to be great. I think for the search engine market. I know
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:15.380]   Apple from my time doing Mahalo a human powered search engine over ten years ago when I sent it to Steve Jobs
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.860]   He opened it up in the middle of the night and started playing with it and there were many
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.980]   reviews of
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:26.580]   Or many rumors of Apple wanting to be in the search business because they had a contentious relationship with Google obviously
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:31.300]   when Google competed with Android that upset Steve Jobs greatly and
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.660]   Also
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.660]   Google created Chrome which also
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:41.660]   Safari and Chrome competing with each other. It's not out of the question. I think Chamath that
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.500]   You could see Apple
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:51.780]   When they lose this twenty thirty billion dollar deal for tack to start their own search engine by DuckDuckGo brave has an amazing search engine
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.780]   and a search API
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:58.980]   And they've obviously they've got a crawler. So people don't know this but Apple has a crawler
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.460]   my prediction is
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:07.340]   Apple buys a search engine and they go it alone and expand their advertising network like Amazon uber and other companies have what's your take on this?
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:12.580]   And what we're gonna see in the future. Will this ruling stand up and then what are the downtree market impacts? I
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.500]   think that this
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.620]   Google thing is
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:20.900]   The most important thing that's happened in tech
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.300]   since the
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.180]   Microsoft DOJ
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:31.580]   Decision in 2000 Internet Explorer. Yeah. Yeah, because if you if you go back to that consent decree in 2000
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.760]   It essentially handcuffed this incredibly
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.500]   foreboding company
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.060]   For more than a decade while all kinds of innovations happen
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:46.220]   So they missed out on two huge waves right Microsoft essentially missed out on
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.900]   Social and then they missed out on mobile
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:55.180]   Largely as a result of that consent decree and then they were able to catch up and embrace SAS and the cloud is
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:58.580]   amazing, but there is this small Oh
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.220]   Outcome here
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:08.340]   which is essentially a consent decree where Google gets handcuffed for some number of years and
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.780]   it creates a
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:19.340]   couple of big waves of innovation of new companies that can succeed that may not have otherwise been able to succeed in
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.500]   the absence of such a consent decree and
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:29.100]   a good example of this would be the AI powered search experiences that you're starting to see whether it's from
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.280]   Open AI or perplexity or a few of these other folks
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.700]   the big Oh
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:42.640]   Outcome though is more if you go back to the Ma Bell kind of thing where the company gets broken up
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.620]   Hmm, I think that the odds of that are extremely unlikely
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.580]   So I think the big Oh outcome
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:55.060]   Is probably something that you can pretty safely take off the table. I think it's going to be a little low outcome
[00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:02.660]   but the point is that there's a distribution here between these two things that this judge will be in control of and
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.140]   I think that
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:12.680]   Again, again, I'm just guessing. I think both the Democrats and the Republicans will really support whatever happens here
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:20.100]   And that's not necessarily because I don't think that's necessarily because they have a bone to pick with Google
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.540]   I think that you know, they have bones to pick with other companies more than Google
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.380]   But I think that it it starts to set the tone for
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:35.320]   Being able to check big tech in a very meaningful and productive way and I think that that has
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.020]   important ramifications for Washington
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:45.260]   Okay, sax not to make it political, but this is the government stopping corporate America
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.340]   So it can't not be political what's your take here?
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:52.540]   And what will we see in the future more regulation more rulings like this slap on the wrist breakup?
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:57.680]   Is this more to come or this is peak regulation in your mind of big tech?
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.740]   Well, I think this is a good decision. I mean Google clearly is a monopoly
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.020]   In fact, it's at least two or three monopolies
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:10.540]   They have monopoly in search their monopoly in advertising and they at least have a dominant position in video with YouTube
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:15.780]   And I think that it would be great if the government broke up this company
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.700]   I mean, it should be it should be at least three or four companies
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.940]   I mean there should be search should be its own company advertising should be its own company YouTube should be spun out
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.140]   And then I don't know if g-suite should be a separate company or should get lumped in with search
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.180]   I I don't know
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.820]   but I think this should be at least three or four companies and
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:37.760]   I think Republicans will be on board with that because frankly Google's a threat to democracy
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:44.340]   If you go to Google and search for search results of anything related to the election, it is clearly so biased
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:50.380]   Explain that. Yeah, give an example. You want to get the latest info on Kamala Harris just search for Donald Trump
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.140]   I mean compare the search results and I've done this and I post the results online
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:02:00.340]   If you search for Trump, you'll get a bunch of negative articles on Trump and you'll get positive articles about Harris
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:07.700]   And then conversely if you search for Kamala Harris, you'll get positive articles about her and it's like Trump doesn't exist. It's clearly
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.620]   They have put their thumb on the scale here in favor of the candidate
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:15.860]   They prefer as 90 something percent of their donations indicate. Here's a real-time search
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.900]   I just did Donald Trump as you can see the first one that came up was a Harris story about Trump and Harris
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.740]   Google has actually addressed this issue
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:27.780]   The issue is actually I think I'll take a little bit the other side of it not bias in the algorithm
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.420]   but bias in media the over majority of media is left-leaning and
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.580]   there's a very small amount of
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.940]   Republican right-leaning media when compared to the left
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.940]   Obviously, and so when you do a search for Donald Trump, you know
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:48.980]   You've got the first three choices New York Times left-leaning Washington Post left-leaning Newsweek left-leaning CNN left-leaning
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:54.500]   Daily Beast super left-leaning five of five are left-leaning. That really is. The issue is that there isn't enough
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.340]   GOP or right-leaning media to actually make this work. That's at least my
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.620]   Take well
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:07.720]   That's their explanation. Yeah, okay fine, but the problem isn't yeah. Yeah, they're waiting the publications. They want to wait
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.220]   Why is Daily Beast like some authority on the election? They're the most partisan
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:18.380]   Ridiculous untrustworthy publication when it comes to the election. So why should they be top four? I mean, why isn't Fox News in there?
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:22.180]   Why isn't New York Post in there? Why isn't substack in there? There's a lot of great
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:30.100]   Publications on substack. So they are very selectively choosing the publications who you're right are in the tank for the Democrats
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.740]   so that they are reflecting the bias of the mainstream media, but they are
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:38.180]   Being very selective about what media they show
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:41.060]   and even so Kamala Harris and
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:44.800]   Let me just give some statistics here here. Hold on Kamala Harris
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:51.300]   I just did a search first five New York Times NBC the Hill CNN is the hill right or left. I
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:55.480]   Don't know left. Would you say sex? It's left. Yeah left and then Forbes
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.980]   Which I think would be considered right and then Fox obviously, right?
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:05.180]   So, I mean, it's just the percentage of new sources here often. Yeah, the Guardians often rank, right?
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.980]   So there's another two
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   Yeah
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:14.340]   I want you to put on the screen this yeah, glad you can do it. I tweeted some receipts
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:20.540]   Please click on the screenshot so I can show you the side-by-side and you'll see what I'm talking about. Okay, I search for Donald Trump
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:24.220]   What do I get news about Harris the first this on my phone?
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.340]   So this is mobile the articles are all basically about Harris criticizing Trump
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:37.220]   Okay, then the second carousel is about the project 2025 director stepping down which is pretty tangential
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:41.100]   Of Trump but is a major democratic line of attack on Trump
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:46.460]   So this whole thing seems rigged to support the DNC point of view on Trump
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.660]   Same thing you search Donald Trump latest news same thing. There's some weird story about Donald Trump's nephew
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.580]   I didn't even know he about this person
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:59.320]   But somehow they're elevating it to be a major story. And again, the first carousel is all about Harris now
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.320]   Keep going, please
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:08.560]   Yes, ma'am. Okay. Now we look at Kamala Harris top stories. Just Harris no news about Trump. Got it. Next one
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.440]   Same thing. Okay
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:18.440]   So the point is that when you search for Trump you get news about Harris and criticism of Trump when you search for
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.580]   Harris you get positive news about Harris
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:27.640]   There's no way you can tell me that this is fair or this is the result of an algorithm that hasn't been tampered with
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:33.640]   This is very clearly programmed. I mean you okay, I'm gonna take these cells depending on which candidate you search for
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.880]   I'm gonna take the complete or the side of this but Freeberg
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.880]   I want to give you a chance because you worked at Google. I think you know a lot about the algorithm
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.840]   What is there an explanation for this that makes?
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:49.200]   Technical logical sense given what you know about the algorithm and then I'll give my position then sure Matthew
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:49.680]   Yeah
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.340]   There's very little kind of editorialization going on with respect to showing the rankings of the new sources
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:03.180]   The ranking of the new sources is typically set by some ranking algorithm. The algorithm is usually around click throughs
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:10.040]   Views popularity of the sites how many visitors there are so there are other metrics that drive the order
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.440]   so for example if NBC CNN
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:17.800]   Fox News all have kind of higher rankings than some smaller publication
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.640]   They're gonna end up higher in the the ranking algorithm because they have a higher call it quality score
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.880]   There's also measures on how often people click through and come back the bounce back rate
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.140]   so if they click through an article and then come back that can actually
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:34.340]   Reduce the ranking versus if they click through and stay on the site
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.080]   So there's a lot of factors that go into the ranking algorithm
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.400]   The thing that probably upsets people is that there isn't any transparency into this
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.600]   So there's no understanding on how these things are ranked how they're set and it's probably very good guidance and feedback that there should be
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.280]   More transparency and openness and I'm not necessarily trying to defend anyone's product or behavior
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.680]   I'm just saying that there's a certainly a lack of understanding on why one thing is being shown versus another
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:02.100]   I'll also say sacks. It is probably the case or there might be the case that there's many more sites potentially putting out
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.880]   pro-harris
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.800]   Articles and there are putting out pro-trump articles which can start to overweight the algorithm as you know
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:14.480]   Or overweight the rankings that are showing up. So that might also be feeding into this that the general
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.800]   News media bias is what you're actually seeing versus a Google bias, correct?
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.420]   I I don't okay. Let me get you my hold on. Let me get you moth involved
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.300]   Here on this issue and then I'll give my
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:31.460]   Generally speaking, I do want to come back to the antitrust ruling in a minute
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:38.320]   okay, absolutely sacks thinks the the fixes in free bird thinks this is explained algorithmic me, but
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:44.560]   That Google could do a better job explaining and being more transparent and about the algorithm. I agree with that
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.900]   I look at the media companies don't always consider it a black box. Go look and I agree
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:57.340]   Yeah, the number of independent journalists why left-leaning publications is like 30 to 1 and
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.900]   Places like Fox News, which is largely we talked about this
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:06.240]   So many there needs to be more investment in journalists by Republicans
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.120]   There are so many more liberal journalists and there's so many more liberal media outlets out there
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.560]   When it was a big at least it's probably 20 to 1. Yeah. Yeah, of course
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.260]   I understand the mainstream media is hopelessly biased. Please remember you said that when we discuss it. No, no
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:28.280]   Sacks I got to stop you there. He didn't say biased what we said was it's 20 or 30 to 1 it's
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.780]   Outnumbering. So if the pool of things the search and come up with is 30 to 1
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.660]   It's of course going to appear bias
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.980]   Which is what they need to do is they need to show who's in the ranking?
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:43.400]   What percentage are left what percentage are right? What percentage are committed middle of the road show that at the top?
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:48.540]   The mainstream media is biased. We all know that you can defend it. However, you want to defend it. You can nobody's appointed
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:54.220]   Okay, fine. So we agree on that. I don't know why you're making agree with you five times making you know points
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:54.620]   Okay
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:58.820]   My point about Google is they're reinforcing the bias because they up rank
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:05.420]   The mainstream media sources and they down rank the sources that provided just an opinion or an alternative opinion again
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.020]   Why is Vanity Fair up ranked above the New York Post?
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:12.000]   Is that because of their journalistic quality? I don't think so
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.560]   Why is it that that Kamala Harris search result?
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:24.700]   Does not say anything about Trump, but the Trump search result has a carousel on Kamala Harris that look like to me
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.500]   Yeah, that looks broken. I'll tell you they also answer
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:34.580]   This was the week Kamala or this the last 10 days or so of Kamala taking the position
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.860]   raising tons of money hiring her VP and
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:44.580]   Trump disappearing from public life for 10 days. So there's also a on top of the 30 to 1 ratio
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:51.700]   Let's say left-leaning journalist to right you also have this was Kamala's coronation week. So therefore it's going to be I don't think
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:57.820]   Google is in the bag with our algorithm. Anyway, I think it's the source material. They're indexing trim off. What are your thoughts?
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:02.020]   one of the things that I like to do when I'm in Portofino is
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:08.020]   When you see these huge yachts in the bay, I like to figure out what they are
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:11.060]   Okay, and so I use Google
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.020]   for like a vessel finder and
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:18.180]   Two of the top three links
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.540]   Send me to spyware
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:29.420]   And I think to myself every time if every year this happens, how is it that in 2024?
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.620]   Google hasn't figured out how to click these links
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.460]   in a sandbox
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.060]   Isolate the ones that send you to spyware and just take them out of the index
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:47.460]   And of course they can do it. They have you know, a hundred thousand people and two trillion a market cap
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:52.500]   So, I think that there's like just the level of
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:59.900]   Technical navel gazing at some level that I think besets every big company and so there are other
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:05.220]   Examples here that you can look at that are a lot less charged than politics
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:11.820]   I think Freeberg is right that it's largely algorithmic, but I think David is right in that there is a quality problem. I
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:17.660]   Think the solution here is that for certain extremely important moments?
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:23.580]   There needs to be a little bit more intervention and there needs to be a little bit more curation
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.660]   So that it passes the smell test
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:32.760]   I mean the the version of this that I that I also experimented with and Nick you can find the tweet that I had
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.180]   Was when I was searching for the assassination of Donald Trump on Google
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:43.420]   It just that it didn't show up. It does show up now. So I think they got the message and they fixed it
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.140]   so clearly somebody's listening and
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.140]   I think clearly then the index
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:51.820]   changes
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:57.180]   so I think that both things are possible, which is the algorithm can improve and
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:02.420]   also that certain things before people start to
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:07.020]   Complain loudly about this perceived bias
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:14.340]   there should be enough intervention to make sure that the algorithmic results pass a smell test and if they're not
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.980]   to add some amount of
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.820]   Reinforcement learning or something else some human correction allows
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:27.860]   That that allows you to get to a good answer. That's unbiased before we leave this topic. Can I show this chart?
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.140]   Okay. Look, this is a
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:39.140]   All of tech is deeply biased towards the audience may not know okay. Okay employee donations take to party are
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:43.220]   Again, it's well over 90% of Democrats. This basically represents the
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.660]   constituency of Silicon Valley
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:53.500]   Okay inside these companies. We also know that Google search results use more and more manual interventions Freeburg you agree with that, right?
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:13:00.460]   There's definitely again, there's there's meant to not be an editorial process, but there certainly is tweaking of rankings
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.860]   Okay, so all the people doing this stuff are
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:08.740]   Democrats they're liberal and you're telling me that this does not have an influence does not create bias
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:14.020]   Come on, you can see the bias in a common-sense search for Trump versus Harris
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.020]   I'm just saying like you've you've we've all made a huge leap in this
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:24.220]   Conversation from talking about an antitrust ruling which I will speak to very specifically in a minute - oh my god tech is biased
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.380]   That's what's driving the you know, the the sense of the nation
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.980]   I don't know if you've noticed sex but more than half the nation is gonna vote for Donald Trump
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:33.460]   More than half like nearly 60%
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.700]   I think it would be like I think it would be like 70 or 80 percent if it weren't for the bias of the mainstream
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:42.100]   Media being boosted by big tech. Well call it balance in the force then I guess but like
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:48.540]   Maybe maybe not maybe not quite that percentage. But if you look if you look at if you look at issues polling on issues
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:56.220]   the Republican position on most issues is like a 60 to 70 percent winner and yet the elections are a nail-biter and
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.540]   I think a lot of it has to do with the influence the mainstream media and big tech. Okay. Well, let's come back
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:06.940]   So I think that everyone has what sacks is speaking to is a deeply rooted feeling held by politicians
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:11.560]   Held by regulators on one side of the aisle or the other
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:17.140]   When Democrats feel shunned by the search engine or by Twitter or by Facebook
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.900]   They raise their hand and they say let's regulate these guys
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:24.300]   When Republicans feel shunned because they're not showing up in the news rankings or the algorithms
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.940]   They feel let's regulate these guys when it actually comes down to the court case
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:35.520]   Here is what is being described when you go to Apple and you type in a couple of words in the URL bar
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.200]   That you want to search for because we've all gotten used to this. You guys may not remember this
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.980]   But nearly 20 years ago when browsers first came out on
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.740]   desktops and on mobile phones
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.700]   You would not be able to just search by typing into the URL bar
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:56.660]   You would have to type in a web search engine in the URL bar hit go and then you go to their search box and
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.220]   You type in your result what happened around the mid
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:06.920]   2000s 2004 2005 is you suddenly were able to type in a couple of words into the URL bar of a browser and
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.900]   Hit go and it would give you search results
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:15.680]   The question is what search engine did it give you those results from and that's what this lawsuit is about
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.140]   Google started to pay companies like Apple
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:26.300]   To make Google the default search engine when you would type in a couple of words and hit go into the URL bar
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:31.260]   Because search became the primary way of surfing the internet not typing in a URL and going to it
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:38.320]   And then when they started doing that they started to see more search traffic. Now the real question from an antitrust perspective is did Google
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.060]   leverage its monopoly
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:45.260]   to pay to continue to be the default search engine to lock in the search market and
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:51.380]   Prevent competition by doing this. Well, the judge the judge already said yes, the judge said yes Google is monopolizing
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.940]   Search because they're paying to lock in the ability to type in to get the default on the search bar
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.300]   By the way, you can go into the settings and change it
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.820]   But what would the other default be?
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:06.900]   So now if Apple David, I think you're being you're being too narrow
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:07.780]   Hold on one second
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:14.140]   You're being too narrow the initial complaint in the Microsoft Internet Explorer thing that kicked off the whole DOJ thing
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:19.420]   Versus the consent decree were two totally different things. I think that you're
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.820]   Estimating the scope of the remedy. I get it. Let me finish
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:28.380]   So like if they were to then say like let's get let's make sure Google can't do that again
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.900]   What's the search engine? Is it Bing?
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.180]   Is it Apple's search engine?
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:38.700]   Because then there would be an antitrust claim to say that if there is a default search engine without the consumer having to actively choose
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.180]   What their search engine is?
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.340]   someone is
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:48.260]   Monopolizing the the install base that Apple has or the install base that whomever has where they are becoming the default search engine
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.860]   Now to your point like the ability for the judge to then say you know what?
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:55.820]   This is one action of many that you are taking to monopolize search
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:01.420]   Let's go ahead and figure out how we can prevent you from monopolizing search and this is really focused on search
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.980]   It becomes a very hard leap to say let's break up the company
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.820]   There's bias in the news feed that you guys are ranking. This has nothing to do with search engine rankings
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:14.220]   It has nothing to do with owning YouTube. It has nothing to do with like owning cloud
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   It has everything to do with Google monopolizing the search business, which is the biggest business on the Internet. I
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:25.420]   Do think they go that's where that consent. I agree. It's narrowed to month and where there's a lot of paths, but I questioned
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:34.140]   I don't think that's a narrowing again the big Oh outcome of breaking up the company like what happened in my bell
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.140]   I don't think that's gonna happen you a
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:42.340]   Little Oh outcome that is a consent decree similar to the one that Microsoft had to sign is very likely
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:48.900]   But what I want you to understand is the way that that started which was literally around Internet Explorer and bundling
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.420]   versus the consent decree
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.500]   was
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.500]   meaningful orders of magnitude broader
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:18:00.820]   so what I'm saying is this little Oh outcome is going to be much bigger than the scope of this lawsuit and
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:05.380]   if they don't man, they have dodged an enormous bullet and
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.580]   all I'm saying is the I think
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:15.660]   If you had to be a betting person they settled on that right like with with Microsoft if I remember right?
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.540]   It was an agreed settlement. Like ultimately they signed a bit. There was it was a consent decree
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:27.220]   Basically, what happened is for 10 years the DOJ became the became the product managers of all critical projects inside of Microsoft, right?
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:30.860]   The point is this which is that when Microsoft went through this
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:34.420]   The government and they had broad support
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:42.900]   Use that consent decree as a way to essentially hobble this company so that other competition could come I don't that competition was
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:49.580]   It wasn't just it wasn't just in the narrow scope of where that initial focus started
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:56.900]   I hear what I'm saying is this judge will read that for sure and I would and if and if Google gets away
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:01.380]   With just having to do something around tack and search
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:05.020]   Yeah, it they have dodged an enormous bullet
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:05.940]   No, I think you're look
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:10.140]   I think you're right and I think the reason you're right is because of how inflamed sacks is
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:15.340]   Because the way that sacks feels I think is the way that every no, I think I think no
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:20.060]   I think if I think if sacks gets its way, it'll be a big Oh outcome and they're gonna know I know I know
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.900]   I think that's where everyone wants it. This actually wants actually one
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:27.980]   I don't know what I'm what I'm saying is the little Oh outcome is meaningfully worse than where this lawsuit is
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.980]   I'm gonna make my final statement. There's a strong
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:34.300]   I agree with you and I'm not trying to defend Google and I'm not trying to defend some outcome here
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:35.820]   I think you guys are correct
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:43.220]   I think that because of how inflamed people are at the influence that these companies have meta and Twitter and
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.660]   Google there is going to be a strong push to do a lot more
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:54.820]   than what the narrow focus of the ruling in this particular case to do something much more significant to hurt these companies and make
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.340]   them less influential and less powerful facts
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.580]   Anything to add I'm not
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:04.980]   Inflamed I have a point of view that I think is informed by facts and evidence
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:10.860]   the fact the matter is the vast vast majority well over 90% of the employees at Google are
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.580]   liberal Democrats and
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:18.940]   The Google search does rely on manual actions and the people performing those actions are
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:20.860]   again
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.860]   Overwhelmingly from one side of the political aisle
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:29.700]   Furthermore we can see in the search results that they do appear to be hopelessly biased in favor of one candidate at the expense of
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:35.740]   Another I mean you're asking me to deny the evidence my own eyes and ears. I can see what's happening
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.260]   I think most people can see what's happening
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:43.940]   I do not think that Google should be putting its thumb on the scale on one side of the election here and
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:49.500]   Jason you may have a point that it's reflecting the bias of the mainstream media. I don't think that makes it
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.140]   Okay, I think that Google should have to work a little harder to be neutral
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.860]   And they could do that use they could do that easily by balancing their new sources
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:04.660]   Okay, I feel like sax and I got to the perfect place. I agree. Google's filled with obviously left-leaning. Don't deny that
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:08.740]   I agree that the left the my the media is biased
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:13.200]   They all picked a side and then I just want to show you one chart because it's super important for you to understand
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.420]   the number of people in
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:20.540]   Journalism this is from 1971 to 2022 who say they are
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:26.420]   Republican has just absolutely plummeted. I know this and this is what I'm trying to explain to you
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.060]   sax is a
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.860]   Incredible opportunity for your party since you know
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:36.840]   You're passionate about this is to invest in more journalism invest in more journalists because I don't buy this
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:43.340]   Independence the fact that they're claiming they're independent in journalism. I believe that's cap. I believe they say that but the gap is
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:49.060]   33% now between people who say they're Democrats and people who say they're Republican in journalism
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:52.220]   That is a key piece to this problem and layered on top of it
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.820]   I agree with you that Google is filled with liberal people and I agree with you Chamath
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.860]   That they need to intervene and put at the top of the search results in news
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:04.380]   These are the you know, this is what we're indexing. This is the percentage that's left-leaning
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.220]   This is the percentage that's right-leaning and there are a lot of organizations that
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:09.580]   examine and rate
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:16.180]   Publications on their bias left and right and that's something that Google could do that's very unique and that could move the show
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.900]   Okay, you're sick, which is they could showcase that up top
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:23.500]   So to my friends at Google who are listening do a better job of just being more transparent
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:29.220]   So we don't have this tension in society. Okay, it's time for saxes red meat sacks
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.200]   We have a VP candidate. You have been
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:38.980]   Absolutely waiting for this moment. The race is a dead heat. Here's your second course of red meat
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.260]   I brought you that giant this you know what this is. This is
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:49.980]   No, this is the state for two for one you ordered the state for two for one sacks
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:55.100]   Get in there medium-rare. You got your cowboy cut. What did you think when you saw?
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:58.780]   Kamala Harris and her VP pick
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:01.620]   move ahead in
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.860]   almost universally all
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:07.740]   polls and prediction markets to the lead over your boys
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:13.820]   Trump and Vance. What did you think of the pick? Go ahead. Enjoy your seat. Well, I was very nice
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.980]   I was very happy with the pick
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:20.780]   I mean, so first of all, I think I said last week or two weeks ago that I thought the pick was would be Shapiro
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.340]   Josh Shapiro the governor of Pennsylvania
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:28.660]   it was such an obvious choice for Harris because this whole election could easily come down to
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.580]   10,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It is the tipping point state and
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.820]   Harris probably has to win that state in order to win the election and
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:41.860]   You have a very popular governor of that state. He's got something like 63%
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:46.060]   Popularity in that state. He's also perceived as a moderate
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:51.100]   So he would have helped Harris position the ticket more towards the center
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:55.740]   Which apparently is her goal since she's repudiated all of her far-left positions
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:01.340]   so it just seemed teed up to be so perfect and then what happened is there was a smear campaign by the
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:08.740]   Progressive left against Shapiro. He was the only one of the VP shortlist candidates that seemed to get all this oppo dumped on him
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:16.260]   before the pick and that campaign against Shapiro seems to have spooked Harris who seems to be fairly risk averse and
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:23.340]   she went with this guy Tim Walz from Minnesota who is a darling of the
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:29.380]   Radical left and I think that he's already presented many opportunities for attack by the right
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:36.500]   There's three big issues that I think waltz is gonna have to address because Republicans are already landing blows on him number one
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:40.940]   Stolen valor. He has clearly and on several occasions
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:44.220]   overstated the extent of his military record
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:50.420]   Look, obviously, I've never served but I know that among people who have this is a very big deal
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:58.020]   Have big issue campaigns have imploded over this. So that's number one. He's got the stolen valid problem number two on trans
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:02.660]   he seems to have bought into every aspect of the trans agenda and
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:11.660]   He's made Minnesota a sanctuary state for minors who want to come there for puberty blockers and sex reassignment surgeries
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:18.780]   Even without parental consent the law that Gavin Newsom just passed or signed that drove Elon out of the state
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:25.220]   Tim Walz got there first in Minnesota. So he is he is not a centrist
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:31.060]   He is very far on the cultural left and then I'd say like a third issue that I don't even know if people have really
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:35.540]   Gotten to yet, but I think it will eventually come up is that
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:39.820]   Waltz was was insanely authoritarian on kovat
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:45.620]   I mean, this is a guy who told us that Minnesotans live by a motto of mind your own damn business
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.900]   But he set up a kovat stitch hotline
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:54.260]   so people could rat out their neighbors for leaving the house or having dinner parties or walking their dog without a mask and
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:58.340]   It was it was real. I mean violators could be punished by 90 days in jail
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:02.180]   So again, this guy has been to the left of Gavin Newsom on
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:07.420]   Cultural issues and I think that's gonna be a big problem for the Harris campaign
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:11.700]   And I don't really understand why she went with him when there was such an obvious
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:16.900]   Alternative who was available who could have given her a swing state who could have positioned
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.860]   You want to speculate
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:29.660]   Your chance to bash the Democrats and speculate coachman. No, I have no bashing to do I will say
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.300]   two things
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.300]   One is that I think his
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.180]   Stance on
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:42.580]   This trans stuff is a little problematic in these swing states
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:48.660]   I say a little only because I think it matters more what Kamala stance on all these topics are
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.500]   but I do think that where
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:57.540]   there's going to be a big judgment issue around her selecting him is
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:03.540]   if there is veracity to the stolen valor claims and so
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:10.340]   When Sean Ryan has an example incredible podcast if you guys don't listen to it, it's great
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:13.900]   But like, you know when he gets to the bottom of this and he will
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.260]   Tim waltz better hope that he told the entire truth
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.020]   Okay free berg your thoughts
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.700]   We're dancing on the issue here. You had talked a couple of weeks ago about an organization
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:30.940]   That didn't want to put a Jewish person in the top position or in a top position
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:35.620]   Do you think that this is or there are any?
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.180]   concerns of Shapiro being Jewish that caused him not to be
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:46.100]   Selected or do you think maybe he bowed out because he wants to run for president as some people are saying and maybe he his
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:52.900]   Star shines a little too bright for the second position. What are your thoughts? Let's go right to the anti-semitism claims
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:56.220]   I'm not gonna make that proclamation. I don't know what
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:59.100]   vice president Harris's
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:04.620]   Decision-making process was I don't know who should talk to what she cared about if she cared if she was even in charge
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:06.380]   I have no idea
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:10.780]   All I know is that there have been other conversations. I've been privy to behind closed doors
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:16.220]   Where senior people have been passed over because they are Jewish and because of the concerns of someone Jewish
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:22.540]   Being viewed to be in a leadership position in an organization and the impact that that might have that there is a brewing
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:29.500]   Distrust as a result of the conflict in Gaza. Let me say something about this issue, but frankly in defense of Kamala Harris
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:35.720]   I don't think she's anti-semitic and I don't think that accusation should ever be made without real evidence
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:43.680]   Okay, that being said Van Jones who is in a position to know because he's an important political pundit in the Democrat Party
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:50.940]   said that one of the reasons why Shapiro was passed over is because of this issue and he said that
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.100]   Anti-semitism had become
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:58.460]   Marbled into the Democrat Party. I don't know exactly what he meant by that. I saw I saw that quote
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.460]   That was really jarring actually
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:06.380]   So marble is an interesting term. Yeah means it's like absolutely in the fabric of the yeah
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:12.940]   Yeah, so I don't know. I I don't think Harris is I think she's just risk averse and didn't want to alienate certain
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:16.280]   Factions within the Democrat Party agree with that statement, right?
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.820]   But me too in the process of being risk averse
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:24.100]   She chose this guy Waltz who I think has got much bigger vulnerabilities
[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:29.940]   Than Shapiro does and I think the question now is whether Waltz is even gonna make it to the convention
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:31.740]   I think he might have to drop out
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:37.020]   I don't understand by the way, I saw the dating process that Donald Trump had with his
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:43.100]   VP candidates right Saxon. I saw some of it really close. Yeah, explain it
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:49.520]   Well, well, I can only speak to what I saw but it just seemed to me that there was this month-long
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:56.280]   Audition where I think they were just trying to figure out I'm guessing you completely guessing
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:00.520]   where these folks stood on things, but also he was trying to get a sense of
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:07.200]   The person and whether they got along and whatnot, but what I also suspected is that this person was being
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:13.220]   Highly highly scrutinized behind the scenes on everything that they've said or done
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:20.260]   Where the person who's going to make the pick in that case Donald Trump was deciding can I live with these issues or not?
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:25.820]   what the articles about the VP process on the
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:31.660]   Democrat side was more painted along the lines of there was a meeting and
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.340]   she kind of liked him and
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.740]   so she went with him and
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.580]   I agree. I don't think there's a
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:44.140]   Antisemitic bone in her body to be totally honest with you. I don't get that sense at all. No, no
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:50.220]   I yeah, that's not the issue but the calculus right but what I would say is this is the number two person
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:56.080]   I mean, maybe you should spend more than a day and then maybe people should be really vetting this person
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.460]   Behind
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:06.020]   Closed doors on all of the things that could go wrong. And I mean you have to assume that that happened
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.300]   Yeah, let me make a couple of points there
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:13.980]   So it's number one is Trump had a lot more time to vet and get comfortable with his VP candidate
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:18.140]   Because he's been the presumptive nominee for many months whereas Harris
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:25.140]   Inherited the the nominee ship without a primary battle right Biden just abdicated less than three weeks ago
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:30.400]   So that's the reason why she didn't really have time to go through a courtship process for her VP
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.180]   Now as to the vetting process, I agree with you
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:40.240]   I think it's somewhat inexplicable because these stolen valor claims have been out there for a long time when waltz ran for governor
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:47.980]   There were former soldiers who came forward and said yeah, he was supposed to be the commander of our National Guard unit
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:51.780]   he was supposed to go with us and he quit right before we got deployed to
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:54.100]   Iraq and
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:32:00.620]   So these complaints have been out there for a while moreover. He has many public statements saying that he was
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:09.140]   Deployed to Operation Enduring Freedom, which I think was Afghanistan and he simply wasn't I mean at least that's what I understand to be the case
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:13.220]   So or he was deployed during that time. I think this sounds like a lot of cat
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.060]   He was deployed during that time, but he wasn't in combat, right?
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:23.100]   Is that he never saw combat and he said that he carried a weapon in combat in war
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:27.220]   So this isn't like a use of sloppy language once or twice
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:33.420]   This has been around circling him for many years now and there's been many examples of him saying these let me ask you a question
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:37.220]   On video. So my point can I just say one thing the vetting was very poor
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:41.460]   I think the vetting was this is what I was gonna say. So there's there was a there was a great quote and
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:46.100]   I don't know if this ever made the light of day, but there was a moment where
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:55.980]   Was thought of as a potential VP nomination, he was like a real big Democrat stalwart and I
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:58.920]   don't exactly know the claims so and
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:04.140]   but I'm not gonna go there, but the phrase that I was told is
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:07.860]   Doesn't vet and
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:10.540]   What it was was a way of saying
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:17.620]   Look, we take our time. We understand everybody's background. We know what skeletons are in folks's closets and
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.860]   in that example
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.860]   Whatever was going on
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:27.220]   was sufficient enough where he would never really get nominated for something very very big and
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:31.940]   I think that's sort of what comes up here, which is that
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:34.540]   in this
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:40.980]   Impassioned desire to make a decision quickly. I still think the Democratic Party had an extra two or three weeks
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:43.860]   to make sure
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:51.060]   Tim waltz really vets now. I don't know if whether these claims are true or not again. Somebody will get to the bottom of it
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:56.260]   but it creates a pile over this campaign too early and
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:34:02.500]   Where I think Kamala probably wants all of that noise away so that she can define what she stands for
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.140]   It's sort of what we said last time
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:10.500]   Go after these five big issues that people care about go into the five states on these five issues and try to win this election
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:14.140]   She can't do that. If this is like, oh
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:18.880]   What is your decision-making like? Why did you pick this person? Why did this person lie?
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.220]   So they have to nip this in the bud very quickly look in my view
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:24.420]   This was an easy choice
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.980]   Even if she didn't like Shapiro
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:31.980]   She could have gone with Bashir or she could have gone with Markelli remember the astronaut Markelli was one of the top two contenders
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:36.300]   You know, at least that was what was reported. In other words, she could have gone with a moderate
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:43.140]   CNN CNN reported that Kamala thought that Shapiro was too ambitious. So okay. So why not Markelli?
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:50.300]   He would have outshined her for sure. Shapiro is really good at speaking and she's not Shapiro Shapiro is really sharp
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.300]   I mean that guy is unbelievable
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:53.580]   Okay
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.420]   I'm not saying it has to be Shapiro
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:35:01.060]   But the the remit here was really clear just strategically you want to choose a moderate from a swing state
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:06.500]   That's it because this whole election come down to one state and you want to basically portray yourself as a moderate
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:11.300]   So this is a very easy assignment find me a moderate from a swing state
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:17.760]   And what do they do? They choose a radical from a safe state safe for Democrats. They got Minnesota locked up
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.020]   Why do they need to take on this baggage? There was no reason for it and
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:26.640]   Chamath I do think they rushed the vetting but I think it wasn't because of passion or something like that
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.780]   I think they're running out of time because remember Biden was supposed to be the nominee
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:33.220]   Harris was supposed to be on the ticket as VP
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:39.020]   They weren't supposed to do this process and then all of a sudden it happened three weeks ago because Biden abdicated
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:42.180]   Look, I think I think that a vice presidential pick
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.660]   matters
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:49.000]   but only so much and I think more than helping I
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:56.060]   Think what VPs do on balance is if you pick the wrong person, it can meaningfully hurt a campaign. I
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:36:00.280]   Think the you know, Dan quail potato thing comes to mind
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:06.300]   you can become a little bit of a laughingstock which just becomes baggage that you have to overcome and
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:10.900]   So this is again where it's a little bit of a head-scratcher
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:14.740]   I would just that thought that this would have been a little bit more buttoned up
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:19.500]   Totally and let me tell you if if if Waltz doesn't drop that from the ticket
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:26.380]   I predict there'll be gold star families protesting all of their events and that's gonna be a real headache from now till the election
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:31.180]   Here is the quote in question Harris campaign and this is from The New York Times
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:36.540]   Had promoted this on social media just so we're clear when we're making all these claims that he did
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:41.220]   Steal valor that he has not been convicted of stealing valor, which is a natural crime
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:44.620]   Just so we get things right here on the pod. Here's the quote
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:52.860]   That he said we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.100]   at and
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:59.140]   So mr. Walsh never served in combat and that quote that he made I
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:04.080]   Guess people are now weaponizing to say that he's saying
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.660]   Those here's a quote those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.660]   So he was not in war
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.740]   Technically he was a reserve
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.820]   And he is battalion was going to be
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:21.780]   Called he claims so that's a guess what we are
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.700]   questioning and Vance said
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:29.780]   I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did this I could see where people might
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:34.220]   Be a little bit I guess he both sides of this issue. It's actually want to dunk on him
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:34.500]   Yeah
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:40.100]   I'm not gonna dunk because this is still an unfolding story and it's gonna play out over the next couple weeks and we'll see where
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:44.020]   It lands but it's pretty clear that he well at a minimum
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:52.160]   Exaggerated his service and he exaggerated his rank. I would like to thank both JD Vance and waltz for their service
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.140]   I appreciate both of their service. I'll leave it at that from my perspective. Listen, whatever I meet a vet
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:02.260]   I always thank them for their service, but those vets will tell you you can never exaggerate what you of course not
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:07.860]   You can't say you were in war when you were not in war. Of course. Yeah, so I guess we'll see how this plays out
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:15.300]   All right, everybody. This has been another amazing episode of the all-in podcast to recap
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:19.900]   Google's big news. The markets are in flux. The end trade is off and
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:25.800]   Kamala Harris leads the race. We've got eight weeks left
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:32.060]   We'll be here for you every single week and we will be seeing some of you at the I believe sold out all in summit
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.060]   Are we sold out right now in Friedberg?
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:39.260]   Master of ceremonies Friedberg executive producer. We are sold out. We might do a little overflow
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:44.100]   Just because we know people don't show up. So we might do a little bit of a last-minute
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.660]   kind of overflow ticket sale, but
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:53.540]   We are sold out. People need to know about their party. Everybody is asking me what party outfits do I need the first night's party?
