[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900]   >> Well, thank you very much, Tai-Danae.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.360]   It's a real pleasure to be here.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.840]   I was so honored to receive the invitation to speak to this group.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.160]   And I will say I appreciate all of the effort that she went to.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.320]   I've never had as many helpful emails in preparation for this as I had from her.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.120]   So I appreciate that very much.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.000]   I don't normally, when I give a talk, like to talk about my personal background, but
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.520]   I don't know most of you here, and most importantly, Tai-Danae instructed me to do this.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.360]   So I will go over this very briefly, just by way of introduction.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.360]   I had the pleasure of being raised in a Christian home.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.880]   Both of my parents were believers at the time of my birth, and so I had that huge advantage.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.580]   But I was also, as a youngster, fascinated by the natural world.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.480]   And every summer, you could find me out in the yard with a butterfly net, capturing every
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.940]   conceivable insect I could find and studying those.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.120]   Eventually, I grew up, went to college at Duke University with a degree in biology.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.160]   Most significant thing that happened to me during that time was I met my future wife.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.800]   And then I went to medical school, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.240]   I was actually born in Houston, so I was back home for that phase of my life.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.720]   And I actually got married to Debbie during my final year of training in medical school
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.920]   there in Houston.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.600]   And if you've ever spent any time in Texas, you'll know, unlike Southern California, it
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.120]   gets very hot there.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.480]   In fact, it's one of the hottest places in the country during the summer.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.760]   And so what I decided to do was move to the coldest place in the country.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.300]   And I did my neurology training and ultimately a fellowship in movement disorders at Mayo
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.320]   Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.840]   My final year there was a combined fellowship in movement disorders where I did about three-fourths
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.760]   of it there in Rochester, but during the winter, I was able to rotate to their Scottsdale,
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.840]   Arizona operation.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.600]   And that was fulfilling a promise I made to Debbie that I would only make her spend three
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.760]   winters in the frozen north.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.240]   Following that, my first job was actually my faculty position at University of Texas
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.160]   Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   I joined that as a brand new assistant professor and stayed there for almost 30 years, gradually
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.440]   progressing up the ranks.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.480]   And I'll tell you a little bit more in just a minute about my research interest there.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.440]   And then very recently, just in January of '23, so just a year and a half ago, I retired
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.960]   from that position and moved to a small boutique practice on the beach in Florida.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.440]   There are a number of reasons why I decided to do that.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.640]   The most important was my eldest son, who is also a physician, and although I told him,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.160]   "Hey, we need a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist," something like that in the family, instead
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.780]   he went into neurology and movement disorders.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.780]   So he does exactly what I do, and he took this job in Florida with a longstanding friend
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.880]   of mine, and when he got there, he started calling me up and saying, "Dad, why are you
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   still practicing in Dallas when you could join us here in Florida?"
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.240]   And eventually they twisted my arm and we decided to do that.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   Also I had always harbored a lifelong dream of retiring in Florida, which is kind of a
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.480]   funny story there because when I mentioned this to my wife, she said, "Well, you've never
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.360]   mentioned that to me."
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.240]   So that was something we learned about each other late in the course of our relationship.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.320]   Most importantly, though, I do want to share with you a little bit about my spiritual development.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.340]   I already told you I was born into a Christian family.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.840]   My parents nurtured me and the Lord from the earliest age.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   Some of my earliest memories are sitting on the side of my bed before sleep and being
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.240]   read to by my mom and dad from the Bible in pictures in little eyes.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.680]   And very early on, I understood the gospel as a child would understand it and received
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.640]   salvation from the Lord at that time.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   I also had the privilege of being raised in a number of different Bible-believing churches
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.680]   as I grew up.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.240]   My dad was very interested in small group fellowship type of activities, and he really
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.880]   mentored me in how to do that.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.860]   And so starting probably even in junior high, I began to look for opportunities to be involved
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.280]   in home fellowship groups and was given some leadership roles in that, and really that
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.560]   became one of my passions individually.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.840]   In college, I discovered the tape ministry of John MacArthur.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.680]   And back in those days, there were no MP3s, nothing you could download, so I had a huge
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.280]   drawer full of those tapes that I was listening through.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.920]   And that was a huge element in my spiritual development.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.200]   Ultimately, as I grew older, with the church that I was involved with, I had the opportunity
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.000]   to kind of head up a home fellowship ministry there at the church and was tasked with writing
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.920]   kind of an advanced Bible study series on 14 books of the Bible.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.880]   And that just consisted of questions that kind of elucidated what the text was talking
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.440]   about and led to discussion and sharing about how the Lord was working our lives.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.240]   Ultimately, I was asked to serve as an elder, where I did, at Countryside Bible Church,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   again in Texas.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.960]   That's where we lived for almost those 30 years when I was in Dallas.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.160]   And then I had the additional privilege of being asked to serve as a member of the board
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.600]   of directors of Master's Seminary and University from 2016 to 2021.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.640]   As you can tell from those dates, towards the latter part there, we had some real difficult
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.800]   times trying to figure out how do you navigate a worldwide pandemic in a state that really
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.080]   wants to shut you down if you're a Christian.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.920]   And so the Lord worked really amazingly in my life and I think in the lives of all of
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.280]   us as we learned how to do that.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.600]   Little bit about my professional career.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.560]   My primary passion from the very beginning has been the field of Parkinson's disease.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.360]   Someone asked me earlier, "Why did you go into Parkinson's?
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360]   What was the deal with that?"
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.080]   Interestingly, I had no one in the family, so it wasn't a personal thing.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.200]   But as I was going through my neurology training, I was particularly drawn to this disease.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.400]   I think mainly because of its therapeutic emphasis.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.800]   Neurology sometimes carries kind of a bad rap that we make a lot of diagnoses, but we
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   can't really help many people.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.520]   That is becoming less and less true, but at the time I was going through it, we looked
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.880]   at Parkinson's as one of the most therapeutic of the different diseases that we saw.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.600]   And so that drew me, I think, into the field.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.440]   A little bit about Parkinson's, for those of you that aren't familiar with it, this
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.840]   is a degenerative disease of the brain.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.080]   It's still of unknown cause.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.120]   We've known about it ever since 1817, which was the first original description of the
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   disease.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:20.160]   But it's fascinating, if you travel to India and examine some of the cave drawings that
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.920]   date back to 5,000 years BC, you can find etchings in caves that look all the world
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.800]   like they're depicting patients with Parkinson's disease.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.680]   So we think this has been a problem with humans since the beginning, although we've known
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.680]   very little about it until the last 200 years.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.920]   The biggest problem with Parkinson's is that it is an inexorable brain disease.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.560]   Once the problem begins, it progresses inexorably.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.480]   And we now know that the primary problem is the deposition of an otherwise normal brain
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.240]   protein that begins to undergo a conformational change.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:08.080]   And in oligomers, which are small clumps of that protein, they're toxic to the brain cells.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   And what they essentially do, as best we can tell, is these oligomers of alpha-synuclein
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.320]   start to punch holes in mitochondria.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.360]   And mitochondria, as you know, are the energy pumps of every living cell.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.240]   And if you damage those mitochondria, eventually the cell begins to die, and ultimately energy
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.960]   failure kills them.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.160]   And so I developed very early on in my academic career an interest in figuring out a way to
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.520]   slow or stop the progression of Parkinson's disease.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:48.000]   And that was really the primary effort that I employed while I was there for those 30
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   years.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.760]   And I just want to show you an example of this, just for those of you that aren't familiar
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.440]   with it.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:00.280]   What this represents is a cut section of the human midbrain, which is the part of the brain
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.720]   way in the back of the head, just above the spinal cord.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.120]   And what you can see in a normal person, and this incidentally does not involve any stains,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:16.640]   this is visible to the naked eye, you see these very dark bands that are present in
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.160]   the human midbrain.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.560]   If you look at your Parkinson's disease brain, what you can see from the back of the room
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.940]   is those black lines have disappeared.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.480]   And the reason they've disappeared is shown here.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.180]   This is the normal cut section through one of those black lines.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.940]   You see all those large cell bodies of neurons.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.020]   And in the Parkinson's disease brain, those neurons have disappeared.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:47.840]   So this is disease in which the neurons that live in this area begin to degenerate.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   And this little animation here at the bottom, what I'm just showing you is that this is
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.440]   now recognized as what we call a dying back axonopathy.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.760]   And so what happens is the distal terminals of the neurons, illustrated here, begin to
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.300]   die back from their synaptic connections in the center of the brain.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:17.300]   And as a result, you have less and less dopaminergic transmission, and eventually the brain levels
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.080]   of dopamine fall to a critical level.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.160]   And when that happens, the classic symptoms of Parkinson's begin.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   And for those of you that aren't familiar with it, the basic symptoms of Parkinson's
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.960]   are resting tremor, rigidity of your arms and legs, and then the third one is slowing
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.160]   down of movement.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.400]   And so Parkinson's patients begin to get slow and stiff.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.480]   And then ultimately, as the disease evolves, they also develop a balance impairment that
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.000]   can be very serious.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.820]   Now there have been a number of drugs that we have evaluated with the goal being to slow
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.040]   down the progression of this inexorable disease.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.700]   And many of these I was personally involved with testing.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.540]   The first class I'll tell you about just very briefly are called the MAO-B inhibitors.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.420]   That stands for monoamine oxidase.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:22.380]   And basically, this is a normal enzyme that every brain has that breaks down dopamine
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.140]   into its constituent products.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:31.300]   The problem with that breakdown is one of those end products is potentially toxic to
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.300]   the brain.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:37.460]   And so we thought, well, if we give a drug that inhibits that, we'll decrease the risk
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.040]   of damaging the brain.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.760]   So several drugs were tested that did that.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.380]   Dopamine agonists is another example of drugs that stimulate the dopamine system.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.600]   In animal models, they showed that they could slow the disease progression.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.720]   Bioenergetics, I'm sure you've heard of coenzyme Q10, creatine.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.600]   There was a lot of interest early on that if we give these drugs, they'll help support
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.480]   the brain and decrease the rate of cell loss.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.040]   Anti-excitotoxicity drugs.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.120]   We know that when the brain works, it releases neurochemicals, that if they overdo that,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.760]   it can actually damage the cell.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:25.640]   So he said if we give something that antagonizes that, maybe that'll help slow the progression.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   Anti-apoptotic drugs.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:35.440]   Apoptosis is a process where the cells, in effect, commit suicide when their energy levels
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.720]   begin to fall.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.880]   And we know that energy loss is a key component of Parkinson's.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:48.080]   So we figured if we can inhibit that apoptotic process, that'll help and slow down the progression.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.440]   We also know that inflammation is a huge problem in the brains of Parkinson's patients.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.020]   They develop an increase in the microglia, which are inflammatory cells that cause damage
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.800]   to neurons.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.280]   Antioxidants, vitamin E, a drug called Inazine.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.920]   We thought that if we could antagonize oxidation in the brain, that surely would slow down
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.520]   the progression.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.200]   We also explored trophic factors.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:25.400]   These are drugs that mimic naturally occurring proteins in the brain that enhance and nurture
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.440]   brain cells.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.320]   And so we said surely that would slow it down.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:35.360]   And we even found from a very interesting epidemiologic study that patients who are
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:42.040]   taking a particular drug for blood pressure control had a much lower risk of later developing
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   Parkinson's.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.560]   So we said, well, maybe that drug would help to slow down the rate of progression.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:55.660]   And the results of this were that everything we tried failed, without exception.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:02.100]   And I can tell you that even as I stand before you today, over 200 years after our formal
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:08.080]   recognition of Parkinson's, we have nothing that slows down the progression of Parkinson's.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.840]   I want to hasten to add, we've got excellent treatments for the symptoms.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.140]   So this remains a highly therapeutic field for us, but we can't do anything about the
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.320]   progression of the disease, at least as we stand today.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:33.520]   So how does this discovery, if you will, of my abject failure of 30 years of research
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.000]   interact with my faith?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.040]   And here's the answer to that.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:47.800]   First of all, these failures show us the sheer complexity of these neurologic diseases.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.120]   We do not understand the brain.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:58.080]   And anybody who tells you we've got the brain figured out is either misguided or lying.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:05.360]   It also highlights for me the difference in intelligence between the creator and the creature.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:11.080]   The God that we worship is so much greater than we are, that he has created things that
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.960]   we can't understand and that we can't fix.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.520]   So it really is a testimony to the greatness of our creator.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.120]   And therefore, the failure to solve human disease, ironically, strengthens my faith
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.040]   in Christ.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:32.560]   This is why we need our faith, because it's real, because there really is a creator.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.600]   And he is so magnificent that he can do these things that we can't even fathom and can't
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.480]   even appreciate.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.520]   And unlike us, Christ is a true healer of disease.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.640]   We doctors do the best we can to palliate suffering, to help people feel better, to
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.480]   do whatever is possible to alleviate their suffering.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.040]   But at the end of the day, only our Lord is a healer.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.800]   And I love this verse in Matthew 8.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   I just want to read it to you.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.280]   "Now when evening came, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.800]   And he cast out the spirits with a word, and he healed all who were ill in order to fulfill
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.760]   what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'He himself took our infirmities and
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.240]   carried away our diseases.'"
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.880]   You know, there's a lot in that verse that we can unpack.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:34.600]   But what I want to point you to today is one little word after the word healed.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.920]   He healed all who were ill.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.880]   I don't know if you've ever thought about that.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:48.340]   When our Lord went from town to town in Israel, He was eradicating disease.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:53.800]   Everybody who was brought to Him was being healed, not just those who had faith in Him.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:00.240]   In fact, it is infrequent that Christ healed people on the basis of faith.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.160]   Most of the time, He simply eradicated disease wherever He went.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.640]   Absolutely amazing.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.640]   So what is my goal then in the talk this morning?
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:19.320]   First of all, from neurology, I hope to impress you with just how great a creator God is.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:27.840]   Secondly, from selected miracles of Christ, I want to show you how powerful our Lord is.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:35.200]   I want to demonstrate the impossibility that Christ's miracles have a natural explanation.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:42.440]   And I want to finally prove the point that His healings were actually acts of creation.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.720]   That's what our Lord was doing when He healed disease, is He was recreating whatever was
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.320]   wrong in that person.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:19:01.760]   So the big idea then for the talk this morning is that Christ's healings were acts of creation.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:09.880]   And we know this from Colossians 1 verse 16, "For in Him all things were created, both
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:16.840]   in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:23.120]   authorities, all things have been created through Him and for Him."
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:30.920]   So our Lord is the creator and His acts of healing on this planet during His first coming
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.600]   are acts of creation.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.840]   So the miracles I want to review with you this morning in the few moments we have are
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.880]   number one, I want to talk to you about the man blind from birth, this famous account
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.520]   found in John chapter 9.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.720]   I want to tell you about the man with the withered hand whom our Lord healed as described
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.280]   in Matthew 12 verse 9 and following.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.780]   And I want to tell you briefly about the woman who was crippled for 18 years described in
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.280]   Luke 13.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.200]   So let's begin with the account of blindness from birth.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.880]   I hope you have your Bibles with you today because I want to read this text for you.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.600]   It's absolutely incredible.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:21.200]   This is John 9 verses 1 through 11.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.560]   As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth and His disciples asked Him saying, "Rabbi,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.760]   who sinned, this man or his parents that he would be born blind?"
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.900]   Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this was so that the works
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.820]   of God might be manifested in him.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:48.900]   We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.140]   Night is coming when no one can work.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:57.460]   While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.820]   Now when He had said this, He spat on the ground, made clay of the saliva and rubbed
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:07.340]   the clay on His eyes and said to him, "Go wash in the pool of Siloam," which is translated
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.340]   sin.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.380]   So He went away and washed and came back seeing.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.100]   Therefore the neighbors and those who previously saw Him as a beggar were saying, "Is not this
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.760]   the one who used to sit and beg?"
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.860]   Others were saying, "This is He."
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.500]   Still others were saying, "No, but He is like Him."
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.980]   He kept saying, "I am the one."
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.380]   So they were saying to them, "How then were your eyes opened?"
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:37.500]   He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made clay and rubbed my eyes and said to me,
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.220]   'Go to Siloam and wash.'
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:46.860]   So when I went away and washed, I received sight."
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.180]   Now let's talk for a minute about congenital blindness.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:56.220]   I think you need to understand the significance of this problem.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:03.240]   Here on the right-hand side you see an illustration of the design of the human visual pathways.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.140]   And it's really brilliant the way this was designed.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:14.820]   You have here obviously the eyes and light comes in at this angle and hits what you see
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.220]   is the blue area.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:22.500]   Light coming in from the right-hand side hits the red part of the retina.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:30.020]   And fascinatingly, these pathways have both an ipsilateral projection and a contralateral
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.140]   projection.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:37.980]   So you see both eyes that are perceiving the right hand of the world wind up on the right
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:44.060]   side of the brain and the portion of the eyes that sees the left side of the world winds
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.900]   up on the left side of the brain.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.660]   So this is the way the human visual system is designed by Christ.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:56.220]   This little area here is called the lateral geniculate nucleus where the primary first
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:03.380]   order neurons that exist in the retina synapse with the second order neuron that projects
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.640]   into the occipital lobe of the brain.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:12.060]   And it's the brain's occipital lobe that actually perceives what you're seeing.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.180]   Now here's the kicker.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:25.900]   You have at birth all of these neurons preformed during the process of genesis in the womb
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.580]   of your mother.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:36.360]   But the problem is that if this retina does not see light in the first few days, weeks
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:45.020]   and months of life and not only not seeing light, it has to see formed images.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:51.460]   What happens is the synapses that occur in the lateral geniculate nucleus don't see the
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.340]   release of neurotransmitter because you're not perceiving anything.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.300]   And the result of that is these pathways disintegrate.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.180]   So they never develop.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:11.580]   Vision in the first year of life is critical to the actual development of the visual system.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:17.380]   And so if you are blind from birth, all of these cells that normally go to the brain
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.320]   and enable you to perceive light, they die out.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.900]   They don't persist.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.780]   And this part of the brain literally shrinks.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:31.700]   A good example of this is congenital cataracts, not a terribly uncommon condition.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:37.780]   This has to be detected immediately after birth so those cataracts can be removed to
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.820]   enable the infant to see so this visual system will develop.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:50.700]   So in our example here from John, the patient never developed any of these networks.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:57.020]   And therefore, nothing you do to fix the eye or even the retina will solve the problem
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:02.780]   because the neural pathway that perceives vision has failed to develop.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.180]   And so it can't be corrected by any means that's available to us.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:14.460]   The only fix for congenital blindness is a complete recreation of the entire network
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.020]   of the visual system.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:24.620]   And as we saw in our text, Christ did this effortlessly because he is the creator.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.660]   Now in our text, we read John 9, 2 to 5.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:34.140]   I just want to remind you of what this says.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.660]   And his disciples asked him, saying, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.660]   he would be born blind?"
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.840]   Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this was so that the works
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.340]   of God might be manifested in him.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.380]   We must work the works of him who sent me as long as it is day.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.820]   Night is coming when no one can work.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.780]   While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:06.060]   Now this verse is fascinating to me because you notice what the disciples' initial reaction
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   was.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.140]   Well, somebody must have sinned here.
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.660]   We call this the divine retribution principle.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.760]   This is very similar to what we see taught in the book of Job.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.900]   And I had the privilege of teaching through the book of Job in our Sunday school class
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:29.400]   at Countryside for several years and was just amazed at how pervasive this view was.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.560]   And as you can see, the disciples had it.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.120]   But you'll note that Christ repudiated this.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.060]   He said, "No, that's not this.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.240]   This is not the divine retribution principle.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.300]   This was allowed to happen just so I could do this miracle."
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:52.820]   Think about the sovereignty of Christ in making this situation occur so that he could demonstrate
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.740]   his creative power.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:01.640]   And of course, the act of creating sight where once there was only darkness serves to picture
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:09.280]   in the physical world the truth that Jesus is the light of the world spiritually.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   What is common?
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.120]   This is a test question I'm going to ask you here since we're in a university.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.000]   What is common to these two verses?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.780]   John 8, John 9, 8-9, "Therefore the neighbors and those who previously saw him as a beggar
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.920]   were saying, 'Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?'
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.280]   Others were saying, 'This is he.'
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.180]   Still others were saying, 'No, but he is like him.'
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.280]   And he kept saying, 'I am the one.'"
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.600]   That's verse 1.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   How about this one?
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   "Then the Jews did not believe it of him that he was blind and had received sight until
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.320]   they called the parents of the very one who had received sight and questioned them, saying,
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.240]   'Is this your son who you say was born blind?'
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.240]   Then how does he now see?"
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.080]   So who can tell me the answer?
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:58.480]   What's similar about those two verses?
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.720]   Little louder.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   And why were they skeptical?
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:11.680]   Because no one has ever heard of anyone receiving sight when they were born blind.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.020]   And why did they think that was impossible?
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.920]   Because it was impossible, exactly.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.880]   These people were not doctors.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.160]   This is a long time ago.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:31.220]   But even they knew that if you were born blind, it was impossible to receive sight.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.760]   It was an incurable malady.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:42.360]   Well, then we come to John 9, 24 to 34.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.960]   "Therefore, a second time they called the man who had been born blind and said to him,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.160]   'Give glory to God.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.880]   We know that this man is a sinner.'
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.200]   Then he answered, 'Whether he is a sinner I do not know.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.120]   One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.'
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.560]   So they said to him, 'What did he do to you?
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.360]   How did he open your eyes?'
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.400]   He answered them, 'I told you already, and you did not listen.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.640]   Why do you want to listen again?
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.800]   Do you want to become his disciples too?'"
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.440]   I love this guy.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:21.680]   "And they reviled him and said, 'You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.560]   We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.920]   from.'
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.320]   The man answered and said to them, 'Well, here is a marvelous thing, that you do not
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.800]   know where he is from, and he opened my eyes.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.960]   We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.520]   will, he listens to him.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.760]   Since the beginning of time, it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.120]   a person born blind.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.800]   If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.'"
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.520]   What a testimony of his experience and his faith.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:06.200]   "They answered and said to him, 'You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.480]   us?'
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.640]   So they put him out."
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.560]   I want you to get this.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.200]   What infuriated the Jewish leaders even more than healing on the Sabbath, which was a major
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:27.120]   bone of contention they had with our Lord, was the incontributable proof in what happened
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.200]   to this man that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:39.440]   He recreated this man's entire visual system, and no one can do that but God alone.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.520]   This is what infuriated them so much.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.080]   They wanted a way to dismiss Christ.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:51.600]   They did not want to receive him, and so a miracle like this put them in a huge bind
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:58.440]   because no one could dispute that a supernatural act had occurred.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:08.680]   Let me move on to our next one, the miracle of the withered hand.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:19.280]   Let's read Matthew 12, 9-14, "And departing from there, he went into their synagogue.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.080]   And behold, a man was there whose hand was withered.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.040]   And they questioned Jesus, saying, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, so that they
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.920]   might accuse him?'
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.480]   And he said to them, 'What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.520]   a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.480]   How much more valuable, then, is a man than a sheep?
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.160]   So then it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.'"
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.480]   Verse 13, "Then he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.'
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.440]   He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal like the other."
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:06.760]   Again, it appears almost effortless what Christ is doing and how He is executing these healings.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:12.320]   Now from a medical perspective, we can't know for certain what disease this man had.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.200]   As I've thought about it, I think there are three major possibilities.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.400]   The first one would be a traumatic fracture with poor healing.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.440]   We know that if you fracture the hand badly enough and it doesn't heal correctly, it can
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.560]   be withered in a sense.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.520]   It could also represent severe arthritis with joint deformity.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.220]   We've all seen people who have that.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:41.160]   But the third possibility, and the one I am choosing to impose on the text, is that this
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.360]   is hand dystonia.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:50.160]   Hand dystonia, a very interesting problem that fell within the realm of my treatment.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   I'm going to show you a videotape of a patient I had who had this disease, just to illustrate
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.300]   what dystonia looks like in the hand.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.400]   So you can clearly see that, in her case, it's bilateral.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.560]   But notice that her hand is clearly withered.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.920]   She can't manipulate her fingers properly.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:17.980]   And because the dystonia has been long-lasting, it's produced permanent deformity in the position
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.540]   of her hands.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:31.640]   So her hands are essentially non-usable because of the persistence of this dystonia.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.180]   Now what is dystonia?
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:39.280]   This is a fascinating neurologic disease, which, to be honest with you, we don't understand
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   very well.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.080]   It is poorly understood to this day.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.040]   Unlike Parkinson's disease, where I can show you where in the brain the problem is, I can't
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.920]   even do that with dystonia.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:56.740]   We know it is something to do with brain neural networks.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.080]   And neural networks are just what they sound like.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.840]   They're similar to an electrical network that you would have for the electrical grid.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.140]   But it's a much, much more complex network.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:13.720]   It's a situation where neurons are synapsing with other neurons in a very complex pattern
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.520]   that results in the ability to execute a movement.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   Now in the case of dystonia, there is no known cure for this.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.240]   So in that respect, it's similar to Parkinson's disease.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:31.400]   And unfortunately, unlike Parkinson's disease, we don't have good drugs for dystonia.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   What I would typically tell my patients who came to me with dystonia when we're talking
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:43.900]   about oral drugs is that I've got about a 50% chance of giving you a 20% improvement.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.240]   So it's not great.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   And we did try.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.800]   There were a handful of drugs that we would employ.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.300]   Every now and then we saw a patient who did well, but basically it was difficult to treat.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.080]   Now there is a newer treatment called botulinum toxin.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.520]   You may have heard of Botox that has revolutionized our treatment for dystonia.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:12.000]   The way it works is you inject this directly into whatever muscle is contracting abnormally.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.920]   And because botulinum toxin is a paralytic agent, it weakens that muscle.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   And so you can have less of whatever the abnormal pulling is.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.740]   But there are two major problems with this treatment.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.600]   The first one is there's a limit to how much of it I can give you.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.360]   You've all heard of botulism, which is a fatal disease if you get too much toxin in your
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   body.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:40.060]   So we're limited to how big the muscle is that we can inject this with to achieve benefit.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:47.680]   And the second problem is the muscular activity that produces dystonia is so complex that
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:54.080]   we really can't figure out exactly how to balance this out to achieve perfect results.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.080]   And that's why I say it works for a short time, but it never produces normalization
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.160]   of function.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.980]   It makes them better, but by no means perfect.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.800]   And of course you have to repeat it.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.460]   Every three to four months you have to repeat that injection ad infinitum as long as the
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.720]   patient lives.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:17.560]   What can I tell you about this human neural network that's involved in dystonia?
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:24.760]   The human brain has 86 billion neurons, just for you to contemplate that.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:30.520]   That correlates to 100 trillion connections among neurons.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.800]   I hope you're beginning to sense the complexity of this system.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.400]   It is staggering how complex the human neural network is.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:46.920]   And the best science of man has no real idea how the brain works, much less how to fix
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.440]   neural network problems.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:55.720]   We know it's there, we dabble in drugs, but at the end of the day, if the network is bad,
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.240]   we can't fix it.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.400]   Well, what was Christ's solution to the withered hand?
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.600]   I love this, very brief, very to the point.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.520]   He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:11.720]   He stretched it out and it was restored to normal like the other.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:19.680]   I have never had a patient with dystonia that I made normal, not one in 30 years.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.320]   Christ did it effortlessly in a moment in time.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.760]   How do you get a malfunctioning neural network normal?
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.780]   Only one way I know of, you recreate it ex nihilo.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.560]   And that's what our Lord did.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.080]   Everyone witnessing this knew immediately that this was a miracle.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.560]   In this simple command, our Lord is recreating his neural network.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:53.640]   And keep in mind that what he corrected was of a staggering level of complexity, a hundred
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.600]   trillion synapses, and he fixed them all.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:05.440]   Now in seeing this act of creation, our observers had only one of two options.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.440]   They could either bow the knee to the King of Kings, they could recognize that this was
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:17.480]   the Messiah who had been prophesied and who they were all waiting for, or they had to
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:22.320]   attribute the power demonstrated to Satan and purpose to kill him.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.160]   Those are really the only two options.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.680]   So what was the reaction then of the Pharisees?
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.140]   Well we see that clearly in verse 14, "But going out, the Pharisees took counsel together
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:40.520]   against him as to how they might destroy him."
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:46.320]   Now I've thought a lot about this over the years as I've studied the Scripture and learned
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:55.220]   about our Lord and the events, and it's very difficult to understand why they did this.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.680]   Think about this.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.400]   Here is a religion, Judaism.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:07.960]   We have the predictions all throughout the Scripture, including in Moses, that a future
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:14.400]   Messiah is coming who's gonna right all the wrongs and redeem the nation.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.480]   Everybody is looking forward to this Messiah, and all of a sudden, in a point of time, he
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.800]   shows up.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.140]   He proves himself to be the very Messiah.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.480]   How does he do that?
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.200]   He fulfills every Scripture that was prophesied about him, and he demonstrates the power that
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.600]   only God controls.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:40.680]   And yet, the people that he came to rejected him, and the Pharisees led that.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.280]   They were the ones that were determined from the beginning to kill him.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.600]   Why did they do that?
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.760]   I think there are two Scriptures that help us to answer that.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:57.800]   The first was a parable that our Lord told in Luke 19, where he's describing the situation
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.280]   of the Jews.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.520]   So he said, "A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself and
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   then return.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.600]   And he called ten of his slaves, gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Engage in business
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.840]   until I come back.'
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:19.680]   But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.640]   to reign over us.'"
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.360]   What our Lord is doing there is he's telling a parable that is describing the condition
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.020]   of the Jewish heart.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:34.180]   They simply did not want a ruler.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.200]   And why did they not want a ruler?
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.660]   It's because they no longer were true Israelites.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.080]   They had now a false religion, not a true religion.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:50.600]   Their false religion was one based on self-righteousness, based on works.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.840]   And so when their true Messiah came, they rejected him because they did not want to
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.960]   submit themselves to his leadership.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.640]   Now that's a parable, and you might say, "Well, how do I know that's really what happened?"
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:10.360]   Well, here's the definitive answer in John 11, verse 47 and following, "Therefore the
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.040]   chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together and were saying, 'What
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.540]   are we doing?
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.320]   For this man is doing many signs.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.760]   If we let him go on like this, all will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.400]   away both our place and our nation.'"
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.600]   So here we now understand it fully.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.900]   They wanted their place.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.000]   And so what was their fundamental sin?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.520]   It was the same sin that Lucifer committed.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.340]   It was the sin of pride.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.980]   They wanted their place.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.660]   They wanted their nation.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.440]   They were in charge of everything.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.720]   They would not bow the knee to their Messiah.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:42:02.140]   Well, let's move to our third illustration, "The Woman Crippled for Eighteen Years."
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:11.560]   Let's turn to Luke 13, chapter 10, verse 10 and following, "And he was teaching in one
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.700]   of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:20.400]   And behold, there was a woman who for eighteen years had a sickness caused by a spirit, and
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.800]   she was bent double and could not straighten up at all.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:32.840]   But when Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, 'Woman, you are freed from
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.780]   your sickness.'
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:40.960]   And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.760]   God."
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.480]   So she was bent double for eighteen years.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   Now does that sound like a transient passing illness that one can recover from readily?
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.280]   I don't think so.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:04.000]   Now I find it interesting, the text indicates that her malady was due to an evil spirit,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   which is fascinating.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.080]   But in my view, it is more likely that a demon had caused her physical affliction rather
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.080]   than that this was a case of demon possession.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.360]   And why is that?
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.480]   It's because normally when Christ confronted a demon-possessed person, his action was to
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.240]   cast out the demon.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.280]   Here we have a sickness that was demonically induced, but it's a physical malady.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:35.320]   This person has an actual physical disease.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:41.840]   And of course in this text, he simply heals her by laying his hands upon her.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.440]   The power of Christ once again demonstrated.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.200]   So the question is, what disease is this?
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.000]   So I guess I could call this my second test question.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.960]   Anybody know what disease causes you to be bent over double for eighteen years?
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.340]   Well first of all, I've got to show you what it looks like.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.920]   Being bent over double means this.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.280]   So that's the position she's in for eighteen years.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:14.560]   Anybody in the audience ever heard of a disease that causes that?
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   Well believe it or not, there actually is one.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:24.680]   Only a neurologist would know about this, and particularly a movement disorders neurologist.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:34.520]   This is a disease called Camptichormia, also known as bent spine syndrome.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.940]   So this is a real disease.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:46.220]   And because I want you to see this, we'll give you a videotape illustration of it.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.440]   But what are the causes of Camptichormia?
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.280]   What can cause bent spine syndrome?
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:58.200]   Well first of all, if you look at the literature, there is a report of a very interesting scenario
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.940]   that happened in World War I soldiers.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.520]   And in effect, what they did is they developed that bent spine posture.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:11.280]   Now as you may recall, in World War I, there was a lot of trench warfare.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.800]   And so the way that you didn't get your head blown off is when you're in the trenches,
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.960]   you would go down like that.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:22.960]   Well what was weird is these people continued to do that even when they were not in the
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   trench.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:29.080]   So looking back on that historically, this is most likely a case of malingering, where
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:34.480]   basically they figured out that if I couldn't straighten my spine, I would get sent back
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.840]   to the hospital away from the front lines and get out of it.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.880]   So that's where we first see in the literature descriptions of Camptichormia.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:50.440]   However, there are some organic, bona fide neurological diseases that cause this.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.800]   One of them is called primary axial myopathy.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.640]   So if you think about it, the only way you can remain erect is because you have this
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   band of muscles that runs along your spine.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.720]   They're called the erector speedi muscles, and they're the ones that enable you to arch
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.040]   your spine.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.080]   And when you're standing up straight, they hold your spine up.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.040]   If those muscles go away, you're going to crumple forward with the action of gravity
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.880]   on your spine.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.660]   And you can develop an atrophy of those muscles.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:32.280]   Those neurons or those muscles that control the spine's erection can disappear, an atrophy.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:37.140]   Totally unknown why this occurs, but it's a bona fide condition.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:44.180]   And then the third one, of course, the case where I come in, is with axial dystonia.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.820]   So this is similar to the patient I showed you with the hand dystonia, but believe it
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.340]   or not, you can also get this affecting the spine.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:58.780]   And in this particular illustration, what we think happens is there are muscles on the
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.700]   front side of your body, in the abdomen, that are deep.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.860]   They're not the superficial muscle that you can palpate.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:13.860]   They're deep muscles that run along the surface of the spine anteriorly that begin to contract
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.280]   abnormally.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.580]   And just as the lady I showed you affects her fingers due to abnormal muscle contraction,
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.980]   here we have abnormal muscle contraction of the anterior muscles of the spine that is
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.260]   causing that forward flexion.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.380]   And again, dystonia is a neural network problem.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.220]   Let me show you an example of this.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:41.860]   This is a man, obviously, but this is the patient that our Lord healed.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.860]   He has bent spine syndrome, camptochormia.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:51.340]   He is unable to erect his spine any higher than this when walking.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:56.020]   And this is one of the clues that we have that this is dystonia, is because when sitting
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.060]   still, he looks perfectly normal.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.780]   You don't see anything wrong with his spine.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.420]   In fact, he can even arch his spine when sitting down.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:09.880]   But when he stands up and begins to walk immediately and progressively, he begins to flex more and
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.300]   more downward.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:17.280]   So what's happening basically is due to an abnormality in the brain's neural network
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:26.780]   that controls gait, when he starts to pull up that motor program of walking, it progressively
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:32.780]   causes the aberrant contraction of those muscles that we don't want to contract when we're
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:39.140]   walking, ultimately causing him to flex forward like that.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.420]   So that's camptochormia.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.220]   So how do you treat camptochormia?
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:51.180]   Well, if it's a psychological problem, again, there are reports that this could be treated,
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.180]   managed by psychotherapy.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:58.540]   Again, the main problem with those World War I soldiers is they were getting out of a dangerous
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.020]   situation.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.740]   So that's not applicable to most people today.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.300]   There are no treatments for axial myopathy.
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:12.780]   Once those muscles begin to degenerate in the spine, there's really nothing you can
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.340]   do about it.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.380]   No one knows how to fix axial myopathy.
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:24.160]   Now axial dystonia in Parkinson's disease, which is my patient, there have been individual
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:30.360]   case reports of the drug for Parkinson's called levodopa helping.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.540]   There have also been reports of deep brain stimulation.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:38.480]   So it's a new technology now for treatment of Parkinson's where you implant wire electrodes
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:45.020]   into the center of the brain and basically hook them up to a spinal stimulator that stimulates
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.060]   the brain in particular areas.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:51.460]   There have been isolated reports of patients improving with that.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.720]   But none of those are longstanding permanent cures.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.660]   They may produce temporary improvement in the bent spine, but they don't solve it.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.320]   I also tried in a couple of my patients with this botulinum toxin thinking, "Well, maybe
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:10.560]   if I can find the muscle that's pulling the patient down, we can weaken that muscle and
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.920]   he'll be able to stand up straight."
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.800]   Again, the problem is the muscles were too deep.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   I couldn't get to them through the exterior and sufficiently weaken the muscles that were
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.600]   causing the problem.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.840]   And that's the fundamental problem we have with campnicormia.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:34.280]   We cannot regenerate atrophic muscle cells, nor can we correct the complex neural network
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.560]   problem underpinning dystonia.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:43.780]   In spite of the advanced state of medical knowledge in the 21st century, we're helpless
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.040]   to correct this problem.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.620]   So what was Jesus' solution?
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.520]   Well, when Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.000]   your sickness."
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.680]   And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.240]   God.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:08.640]   Notice that Christ spoke to and touched this woman, and immediately she was healed.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.320]   We know from other miracles of Christ that he didn't need to do either of those two things.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:19.440]   He had the power to recreate her neural network without uttering a word or a touch.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   What does this show us?
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.180]   It shows us the compassion that Christ had.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:29.780]   He wanted the physical touch of her to reemphasize his love for her.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:36.420]   Instantly her thoracic muscles were restored, her neural network was recreated, and our
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:43.100]   Lord healed this woman because he is compassionate and merciful.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:49.940]   His act of recreation shown here was effortless and once again proving that he was God the
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:55.660]   creator and proving that there could not be a natural explanation for this because you
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:00.040]   can't fix these neural network problems.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.860]   Now I would leave you with this query.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.220]   What do these miracles have in common?
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:10.060]   Why did I pick these three particular miracles to show you today?
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:17.000]   Well first of all, all three addressed unsolvable neurologic problems that have no possibility
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.860]   of a human cure.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.660]   We can't fix this.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:24.300]   These miracles show that our Lord did.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:32.100]   And in all three cases we see an act of creation, a brand new restoration of normal function
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.560]   in a setting of damaged neurons.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:41.880]   So taken together, these miracles establish beyond any doubt that Jesus had divine supernatural
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:46.200]   power.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:52.000]   That God, not Satan, was the source of the power is proven by the beneficial result of
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.800]   his miracles.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:53:01.600]   He restored to health whereas demonic action always degrades the person and causes illness.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:06.840]   And this is why the Pharisees claim that, "Oh well, Christ is doing this by the power
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.840]   of Satan."
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.080]   It was terribly disingenuous.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.360]   Nobody bought that because demonic forces don't heal people.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.060]   Demonic forces degrade people.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:23.280]   But that was the only thing they could think of to try to explain away the miraculous work
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.800]   of our Lord.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   I think it's also noteworthy that all three miracles took place on the Sabbath, thus
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:38.760]   serving to condemn the Pharisees' hypocritical approach to a day God intended to be beneficial
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.320]   to His people.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.880]   So what can we learn from these miracles?
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.520]   What's the take-home message that I think each of us can take from this?
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.160]   Well first, I think consideration of these miracles should humble us.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:54:01.120]   You've probably heard that there are some doctors somewhere who develop a God complex.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   Why does this happen?
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.960]   Well, it happens because patients trust us.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:11.360]   It's really amazing to be in a position where a patient will come to you suffering with
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.080]   sickness and say, "Doctor, whatever you tell me to do, I'll do it because I want to get
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.080]   better."
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.000]   That is an immense trust that they're placing in us.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.500]   And more often than not, they adhere to what we recommend.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:32.500]   And if you're an unbeliever and you're prone to pride, which all of us are, that can very
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:38.720]   rapidly lead to pride and escalation of your own view of yourself.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:45.040]   But when we think about Christ's miracles and how much more powerful He is, that once
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:50.040]   again humbles us and shows us that no, we really can't do anything.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:57.560]   Our efforts are pathetic and ineffectual compared to how our Lord dealt with this.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.680]   Second, I think these miracles should strengthen our faith in Christ.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.360]   This one's obvious.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:12.280]   If Jesus could recreate neural networks effortlessly in His first coming, He can also forgive sins,
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:16.320]   which God alone can do, and that's our real problem, isn't it?
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.880]   Sin is our real problem.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.940]   Our separation from Him spiritually is our real problem.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:29.280]   And if He can do this, He has proven that He is God and God can forgive sins.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.720]   And then, of course, His healing of physical dysfunction by His divine power at His first
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:41.920]   coming is illustrative of His power to overcome spiritual death now and to raise us physically
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.580]   from the dead at His second coming.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:53.240]   We worship a God who is truly powerful, and therefore, we can trust Him that He will rescue
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:58.400]   us and He will raise us with Him on the last day.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:04.060]   And then finally, these miracles should embolden us to share the gospel with others.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:08.240]   As believers, we need to be growing in compassion toward the lost.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:16.740]   This is what Christ's example to us was of a compassionate, loving Savior.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.460]   All of His healings were motivated by compassion for suffering people, and as I said earlier,
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.880]   most of them were totally disconnected from any faith that person had.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.820]   He simply was merciful.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:34.180]   He wanted to do this because it was a reflection of Himself, His character.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:40.580]   And we need to do that ourselves, and we need to have a compassion for the lost, and therefore,
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:47.020]   if we care about the lost, we'll share the gospel whenever we can.
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:57.340]   Thank you so much for your attention.
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.340]   >> Thank you.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:02.220]   Thank you so much, Dr. Dewey, that was phenomenal.
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.220]   We have a few minutes.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.500]   I know you just sat down, but does anyone have any questions?
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.120]   We have some folks joining by live stream, so if you have a question, just raise your
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:17.100]   hand and we'll pass a microphone around.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.100]   We're just stunned.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.820]   We're just trying to absorb everything.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.100]   Okay, so we have a microphone coming up front.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:30.820]   One second, it's on the way.
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:31.820]   >> Thank you.
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:37.180]   My question is with regard to the second example that you gave, the man with the withered hand,
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.500]   how it specifically talks about it being only one hand that was affected.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.820]   Is that possible with the hand dystonia?
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.120]   >> Yes, absolutely.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.540]   So it can be unilateral.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:50.460]   The example I showed, obviously, was bilateral.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.860]   In fact, that patient had generalized dystonia.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:59.500]   So her whole body was affected, but she was the best video I had showing the hand involvement.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:06.440]   But actually, more often than not, when we see focal dystonia, it affects one hand or
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:07.440]   one foot.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.440]   >> Thank you.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.440]   >> Hi, Doc.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:22.940]   I was just wondering, or actually noticing that not only was the full recreation of the
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:29.380]   brain and all the neurons connected, but the training and understanding of how to use them
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:34.780]   -- we just can't take a paralytic who's never walked and make them have perfect balance
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:35.780]   and walk again.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.980]   It takes years of rehab, even if everything was working.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.940]   So it's not just -- it's the knowledge.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:49.020]   You put knowledge into these people's brain, muscle memory into these people.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.020]   >> Thank you for adding that.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:59:00.420]   That's an excellent point.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.100]   >> Thank you.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:09.780]   My father was a neurologist, by the way, so I have a little bit of knowledge, small amount.
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:16.740]   Other diseases that are motor-related, like ALS, things like that, maybe just a few words
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:20.980]   on how those are related as well.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.980]   >> Sure.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:27.700]   Well, most of the diseases that you think of in neurology that are bad, like ALS, they're
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.500]   degenerative diseases.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:35.540]   So what's happening is there is something that's going wrong in the metabolism of the
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.780]   nervous system that results in degeneration.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.420]   There are fortunately a few neurologic diseases that aren't that way.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:46.020]   Migraine would be one example, very common.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:52.020]   And there are a few others that I would consider to be not as serious that don't involve degeneration.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:57.020]   What's fascinating is that the two most common in the elderly population are Parkinson's
[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.620]   and Alzheimer's.
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:05.260]   And we now know, interestingly, that both of them are due to these depositions of small
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.320]   clumps of protein that don't belong there.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:14.780]   And what's fascinating is the proteins that clump are normal brain proteins.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.460]   All of our brains are chock full of those proteins.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.460]   We need them.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:23.540]   They have specific functions that carry out things that we need to be able to do.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:29.580]   But it's when they start to behave in an abnormal way and they start to precipitate into small
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:35.340]   clumps that they cause the pathology and ultimately cause cell death.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:42.300]   And unfortunately, we don't have any treatments that stop the degenerative diseases of the
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.300]   brain.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.300]   Hi.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.300]   I got three.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:51.180]   I'm not going to be greedy, just pick one of them.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:56.620]   First in John 9, my favorite, it's like the sweetest man on earth.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:02.660]   I believe he heard the disciples and Jesus talking and he realized at some point, yes,
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.580]   I was born blind for this purpose, which is just stunning.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:11.300]   But the second one is a lady doctor from Argentina who, of course, can't practice here, but she
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:17.140]   told me her patients, she knew they had spiritual problems and she couldn't help with that.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.540]   All she could do was tend to their body, which was disturbing if you want to talk about that.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:27.980]   The third is what the chemo gave me induced Parkinson's like shakes, which is that a route
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:33.940]   to demystify those kinds of things and it'd be horrible to do to somebody, but we had
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.980]   to stop the chemo.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.980]   It was also dexamethasone.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.980]   So any of those three.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   Thank you.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:43.780]   So I'll take the last one first.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.140]   Chemo is a fascinating treatment for cancer.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:52.100]   We don't understand it very well, but the one thing we do know is that all chemotherapeutic
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:56.000]   agents work by destroying cells in your body.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:05.660]   So it is not beyond speculation that in particular individuals, the chemotherapy may be mis-targeting
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:11.340]   the cells that are involved in the Parkinson pathway, producing that side effect.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:16.640]   But I would have to say that's considered exceptionally unfrequent.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.100]   So we don't normally see patients with Parkinsonism who have chemotherapy-induced disease.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:27.300]   I wouldn't rule it out as it being a possible on an individual basis, but it's not the rule
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.740]   of thumb.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:32.820]   And I think your other question about how do you deal with the spiritual problems of
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.900]   your patients if you're a doctor, that's a big one.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.940]   I'm going to defer that to the discussion tomorrow.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   Thank you.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   Thank you.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940]   Thank you.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:40.940]   Thank you.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:45.940]   Thank you.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:55.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
