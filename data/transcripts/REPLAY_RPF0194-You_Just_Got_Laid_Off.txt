And the overall way to do that is to focus on keeping your confidence, whatever it happens to be right now, and/or building your confidence up from wherever it is right now. Being laid off or being

[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.020]   It's not just about getting fired. It's about getting fired, and it's a huge impact on your personal confidence. The first thing that we all do certainly that I did is to go and say what's wrong with me. And the problem is, the longer that you go without work, the worse it gets. Some of the saddest meetings I've ever had are with people who are among the long-term unemployed because what happens is their confidence in themselves and the ability and the values that they bring to the marketplace is shot. I remember a client of mine specifically and this is
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:31.040]   in the middle class job and then they got laid off. So back in 08-09, they got laid off. So they thought it would be nice to go ahead and enjoy the time off and enjoy the unemployment. So they didn't look seriously for work. They focused on just enjoying the severance pay that came in for a period of time and just kind of enjoying life. They didn't have a massive amount of reserves built up so that they could really
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:08:00.580]   but they had some savings enough that made them feel like they were well cared for. So they didn't get after it. And they continued to be unemployed. Well, the time went on. Six months turned into a year. A year turned into a year and a half. And I first came into the situation about a year, year and a half after the layoff. And at that point in time, the unemployment was still flowing. At this point in time, Congress had extended the unemployment compensation to 99 weeks.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.060]   and they continued to be unemployed.

[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   And they finally started to get serious with their job hunt. But the problem is by that time, their skills had atrophied. Their personal network had grown stale. And most importantly, their confidence was completely destroyed. They were going and applying for jobs and doing interviews. And the problem was they weren't getting a lot of traction. And because all they had done was play and play without purpose.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   And because all they had done was play and play without purpose.

[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:17.340]   If you study some of the research on the topic of what happens to people when they're unemployed and especially when they become unemployed for longer, you will see a clear pattern that the longer you're out of work, the harder it is to get a job.

[00:25:45.520 --> 00:26:15.520]   I'm going to cover that in just a moment with a couple of citations.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:15.520]   Before we get to how to approach a company and make a targeted approach to a specific company, I would just mention briefly that I would start not with that, but actually by activating your personal network.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:15.520]   Put the people that you know to work for you, because most of them are probably going to like you. And even if they don't like you, they may at least, if they're neutral toward you, may still be willing to do that.

If you're desperate for work, draw a ring around your house and start going door to door. Walk in and talk to the receptionist, talk to the business owners, leave your card, tell them your story. Nobody does that, but I guarantee you'll get hired.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:55.520]   I can't imagine you're not getting hired just because you're out there actually showing initiative and doing things. And many times people need workers and they're just too busy to go and find them.

Now you have a 10-month window. You've doubled the time. But what most people do is they continue spending $6,000 a month for three months. That burns up $18,000. You're left with $12,000. Now, even if after only three months you cut your expenses, you're left with $12,000.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:20.560]   The faster you can cut the more time you have and the more time you have the pickier and the more selective and choosy you're able to be and the more options you'll be able to collect gather and the better this experience will be.
