[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:45.920]   And then deleting them or canceling them prior to the renewal date, who knows, maybe it would make it go up. If however, these three are old cards that you've had for a long time, and then the rest of your portfolio is fairly new cards that you've only had for a year or two, then these three cards could make a dramatic impact in the average age of your credit.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   If that were the case, I would not cancel them, or I'd be very slow to cancel them, or I'd be very careful about it.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.320]   If that were the case, I would not cancel them, or I'd be very slow to cancel them, or I'd be very careful about it.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:11:20.860]  ,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.260]   So the only other impact that you would have, that's the most important impact to your situation, and that would have to do again with your average age of credit.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:51.200]  , So the only other impact that you would have, that's the most important impact to your situation, and that would have to do again with your average age of credit.

[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   So the only other impact that you would have, that would have to do again with your average age of credit.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:12:10.740]   The most important thing here is to always, whenever possible, have way, way, way, way more available credits to you, versus what you would ever, any balance you would ever possibly carry, because that will keep your credit score extremely high, and keep financing options available to you, even if you had a small balance.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:19.140]   So let's say that you said, "I think in the future I might need to have $10,000 of debt while I rehab this property," or whatever your purposes are for this debt.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.140]   So let's say that you said, "I think in the future I might need to have $10,000 of debt while I rehab this property," or whatever your purposes are for this debt.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.140]   If you have a total of $10,000 of debt, you're going to have to cancel the loan.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.140]   If you have a total of $10,000 of debt, you're going to have to cancel the loan.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:51.080]  , and you owe $10,000 across all of your five cards, and you owe $10,000 across your five cards, your credit score will plummet because your utilization ratio will be extremely high, and that utilization ratio accounts for 30% of your credit score.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   If, on the other hand, you have a total of $100,000 available to you in available credit across your credit portfolio, and you have the same $10,000 amount that you have in your credit portfolio,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   and you have the same $10,000 amount that you have in your credit portfolio, and you have the same $10,000 amount that you have in your credit portfolio,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   and you have the same $10,000 amount that you have in your credit portfolio, and you have the same $10,000 amount that you have in your credit.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   And you have the same $10,000,000 amount that you have in your credit.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:13:21.020]   You will have a very high, you will continue to maintain your very high credit score,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   because your utilization ratio, in that case, would only be about 10%. And from memory here, I think the best tier is under 14% of your total available credit available to you.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   So in general, that's why it's a bad plan to lower credit that's available to you,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   because if you ever did carry a balance, if you ever did use it for financing in the future,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   then you want to have the maximum possible, not only the maximum possible,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   but the maximum possible amount of credit that's available to you.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   So if you ever did carry a balance, if you ever did use it for financing in the future,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   then you want to have the maximum possible, not only the maximum possible amount of credit that's available to you.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   So if you ever did carry a balance, if you ever did use it for financing in the future,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:50.960]  , then you want to have the maximum possible amount of credit that's available to you.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   So if you ever did carry a balance, if you ever did carry a balance, if you ever did carry a balance,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   then you want to have the maximum possible amount of credit that's available to you.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:14:20.900]   I would investigate the available age of the debts.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   I would investigate the total amount that this would impact my total credit available.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   I would investigate the total amount that this would impact my total credit available.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   And then I would, what I would do if I were in your shoes,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   And then I would, what I would do if I were in your shoes,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   is I would make an application with all of the credit cards that you don't want to cancel,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   is I would make an application with all of the credit cards that you don't want to cancel,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   to see if they will raise your available balance, excuse me, your available credit.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   Because sometimes what you can do is apply for an increase in your available credit,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   Because sometimes what you can do is apply for an increase in your available credit,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   and then the credit card issuer will come back and say,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   and then the credit card issuer will come back and say,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:43.040]  , and then the credit card issuer will come back and say, "Well, what if I cancel this other card?"
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   "Well, what if I cancel this other card?"
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.140]   And they'll say, "Sure, go ahead."
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.140]   And they'll say, "Sure, go ahead."
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.140]   Or the same thing can happen sometimes when you go to apply for mortgage financing.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.240]   Or the same thing can happen sometimes when you go to apply for mortgage financing.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.340]   They say you have too much available credit,
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:43.340]   They say you have too much available credit,
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:43.340]   You say, well, what if I lower my available credit,
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:43.340]   You say, well, what if I lower my available credit,
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:43.340]   which in which case, that satisfies the model for the lender, and they can go ahead and approve it.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:43.840]   If you can apply and get additional available credit,
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   If you can apply and get additional available credit,
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:56.080]   It does. It does make a lot of sense.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.280]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   Yeah, I would not risk financing on three or four properties over a mere $200.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.880]   But my guess would be, so if you actually have property in mind, etc.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.780]   But if you have no reason to keep these cards with the annual fees around, as long as they're fairly new and not

[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:18.400]   So if you could pay for if you could move this debt from a $21,000 debt that
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.900]   you're paying 17% interest on to a $21,000 debt that you're paying 6% or 0%
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.300]   interest on that would be a good move.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.300]   Agreed?
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:33.000]   Yeah, because I'm like three or four hundred of that every month is my
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.500]   interest.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:33.900]   Right.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.300]   Right.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.600]   It's significant.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.400]   So in the way that and this would also help you.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   even to lower your.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:19:09.340]   Payments.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:39.280]  , $297.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   $297.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   Now, what you could do so if you could refinance this debt and you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   So you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   So you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   So you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   So you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   So you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   So you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   So you could move it from a 17% interest payment to a 0% interest payment.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.620]   Then that right there would save you $297 per month.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:44.720]   Then that right there would save you $297 per month.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.320]   Then that right there would save you $297 per month. It would save you the monthly interest cost agreed.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:48.320]   It would save you the monthly interest cost agreed.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.620]   It would save you the monthly interest cost agreed.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:20:02.020]   So now if you could continue paying the $500 per month it would substantially improve that you would be paying double at least double what you're actually paying right now if you're just making the minimum payment.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:09.220]   So lowering the interest rate is always a good idea and it's especially a good idea while you are in the middle of the year.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:09.220]   The interest rate is always a good idea and it's especially a good idea while you are in the middle of the year.

[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   no matter what decision you make even if your wife saves every dollar that she earns and even if you put every dollar that you earn towards the credit card debt there is still going to be a joint bearing of responsibility when you're out driving lift at night and on the weekends that means that you're not home cuddling on the couch with her thus she's bearing a part of the cost when you're out working you're not doing other things that could be doing when you're spending money from your income

So if you have some kind of physical ailment, she doesn't get to look at your physical ailment and say well my husband is handicapped so that's his problem I'm not going to take responsibility for it or let's say that your wife has some kind of psychological problem you don't get to look at her and say well that's your psychological problem I don't have to deal with it and so why is it any different when it comes down to your financial history she can't look at you and say well you've got $31,000 of credit card debt and I'm not going to take responsibility for it.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:02:15.920]  , that's your problem you've got to deal with it that is a recipe for disaster that's a recipe for divorce when you marry you you unequivocally unreservedly commit yourself to another person and that means all of the good things and all of the bad things and unfortunately I think it's very unhealthy that we even indulge for a moment this idea that well you have your debt in my debt well whose money is it if you inherit a million dollars is it your money or is it her money now there is a level at which legally there are some distinct differences and there are some differences and there are some differences that are both in the other things that are not necessarily the same.

[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:12.320]   But in working through things together, you will be far stronger, and you'll be far stronger if you and she tackle it and say, we're in this together.
