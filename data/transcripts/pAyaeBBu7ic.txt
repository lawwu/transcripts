[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.480]   Praise Him in the heights.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.080]   Praise Him all His angels.

[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.500]   Praise Him heavens of heavens and the waters that are above the heavens.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.640]   Let them praise the name of YHWH, for He commanded and they were created.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.860]   He caused them to stand forever and ever.

[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.980]   Praise YHWH from the earth, sea monsters in all deeps, fire and hail, snow and clouds,
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.920]   stormy wind, doing His word, mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, beast
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.480]   and all cattle, creeping things and winged bird, kings of the earth and all peoples,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.240]   princes and all judges of the earth, both choice men as well as virgins, the old with
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.000]   the young.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.380]   Let them praise the name of YHWH, for His name alone is set on high.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.800]   His splendor is above earth and heaven, and He has raised up a horn for His people.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.060]   Praise for all His holy ones, for the sons of Israel, a people near to Him.
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.500]   Praise YAH.
