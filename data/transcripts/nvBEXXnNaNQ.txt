[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   "I get so passionate about it, I get so angry."
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.120]   You know?
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.080]   Because there's this saying like,
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.480]   "Oh, can you beat him at a hook?
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.320]   "Can you beat him?"
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.920]   Man, win, win.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.760]   That's it.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.460]   Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.540]   - You believe the match is finished.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.600]   And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.440]   - You see this?
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.260]   - Yeah.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.020]   Quit.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.360]   The following is a conversation with Devon Larratt.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.240]   Considered by many to be one of the greatest
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.800]   arm wrestlers in history.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.400]   in the description.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.460]   And now, dear friends, here's Devon Larratt.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.080]   You are considered to be one of the greatest
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.960]   arm wrestlers in history.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.480]   Plus, are one of the most charismatic
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.880]   and fun people to watch in arm wrestling.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.320]   But let me first start with the ridiculous,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.100]   the controversial opinion.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.840]   I actually really enjoy "Over the Top,"
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.440]   the movie with Sylvester Stallone,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.040]   where he's a trucker.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.480]   It's like a father-son movie.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.560]   It's, you know, like a bunch of sports
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.280]   have the definitive movie.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.920]   Boxing has Rocky, maybe folk style.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.680]   Collegiate wrestling has Vision Quest.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.800]   What else is there?
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.520]   Billiards has "Color of Money."
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.620]   This is the sort of movie for arm wrestling.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.760]   So what did "Over the Top" get right?
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   What did it get wrong about arm wrestling?
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.200]   - That was actually based off of a real story.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.600]   A lot of people don't know that.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.920]   Yeah, the "Over the Top" movie,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.640]   I mean, to a certain degree,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.880]   that's actually real life.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.240]   Like that tournament, "Over the Top," was real.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.880]   - It was literally named "Over the Top."
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.720]   - Yes, yes.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.480]   There was a trucker division,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.120]   and the guy actually won a truck for real.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.000]   His name's John Brzenk.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.440]   You know who that is, right?
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.080]   So the actual "Over the Top" tournament,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.720]   the trucker division was won by John.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.480]   - Who is John Brzenk?
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.160]   He is, a lot of people talk about him
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.080]   as like a legend and one of, if not the greatest,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.680]   arm wrestlers of all time.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   - John Brzenk is every arm wrestler's father
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.600]   to a certain degree, all of us.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.380]   The entire sport looks up to him.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.620]   It's incredible what he's done.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.840]   I mean, at 18, he won "Over the Top."
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.480]   At 57, he just competed with me a couple months ago.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.720]   Still at the world level, 18, that's 40 years
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720]   of being at the top of the sport.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.080]   It's incredible.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.120]   He's hailed as the greatest of all time
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.480]   in the sport of arm wrestling, yeah.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.080]   - And he doesn't, he's beaten some monsters.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.280]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.680]   - And he doesn't.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680]   - I mean, when you talk about like the evolution
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.600]   of the sport, he's responsible for so much of it.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.000]   Like when you talk about, like a lot of times
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   when you go back like 20 years, 30 years,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.280]   a lot of us looked at arm wrestling, I think,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.400]   I mean, as something you could kind of do.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.040]   And he's the first guy who's like,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.080]   if you want to get better at arm wrestling,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.400]   you got to arm wrestle.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   And it seems so simple, but he answered so many questions
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.360]   that all of us had about techniques in the sport,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.660]   back pre-video internet.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.480]   Yeah, he's been everybody's target for like 40 years.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.120]   - So in terms of strength, in terms of power,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.960]   in terms of skill, what did he teach
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.920]   the sport of arm wrestling?
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.040]   So if you look, how did the sport change
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.280]   from 80s, 90s to the aughts?
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   You were at the top of the world for many years.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.000]   Many argue you're still at the very top of the world,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.120]   but like you were very dominant, both left and right hand
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   in, I don't know, 2008 to 2013, something like that.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.000]   So how did that sport evolve to today?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   - So it's hard for me to comment prior to,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.800]   when I came to the sport was kind of mid 90s.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.440]   Like I've been arm wrestling my whole life,
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.640]   but I wasn't really involved in the sport
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.520]   to a major degree until probably mid 90s.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   But I'll say that before the mid 90s,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.520]   it was really hard to get good at arm wrestling,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.700]   very difficult.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.360]   Everybody was doing it wrong, really.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.960]   Like it was really rare to find people
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   who were technically good arm wrestlers.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.920]   It was very underground.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.880]   When I got into sport, it was a flyer that came in the mail.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.720]   You had to know somebody who knew somebody
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   who knew somebody, and then you go to a club
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.000]   and you can't do anything with these people.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   And they knew how to arm wrestle, they did,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.040]   but real masters were rare.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.880]   And then internet, internet helped everybody.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.460]   Communication, the transfer of knowledge
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.700]   became so much faster.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.960]   People became technically invested.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.760]   People started train, sharing ideas.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   By I'd say 2000,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.080]   well, probably around the turn of the millennia,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.160]   I'd say that professional leagues started to slowly pick up
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.240]   more organized, bigger productions
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.720]   started to attract more athletes.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.520]   More people took it seriously.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.300]   By 2010, I'd say there was another jump,
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.800]   more serious leagues, a little bit more money.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.360]   By 2015, more major media,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.520]   like people were investing a lot of money,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.240]   like millionaires, billionaires type of people
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.580]   were organizing events, setting up leagues.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.360]   And yeah, I mean, the past five years,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.040]   it's just blown up.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.000]   The techniques, I mean, if I was to go back
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   to when I started, what took me 10 or 15 years to learn,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.760]   I mean, new guys are showing up
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.600]   and they've got it down in like a year.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.340]   - Well, the thing about it, the development of the sport
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.460]   is it's, like I was telling you off mic,
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.460]   it's a battle of one versus one.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.360]   And then that can turn into battle of nations,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.840]   which there is, there's Canada, there's the United States,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   there's all the Eastern Europe, Russia, Georgia,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.700]   all of that.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.760]   That's what makes some of the greatest sports
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.120]   in Olympics great, like weightlifting.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.440]   It's a battle of nations,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.920]   not just the battle of individuals.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.800]   And it's almost like these two humans
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.600]   represent the two nations.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.960]   And I see that very much,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.460]   we'll talk about your matches coming up,
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.740]   but there is that battle between North America
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.480]   and that other part of the world.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.520]   - Yeah, yeah, North America is very prized.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.160]   The North American champion is always highly sought after
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.400]   because they're typically the most famous.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.000]   Even still when, quite arguably,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.560]   there's always somebody in Eastern Europe
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.880]   who's just monstrous.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.180]   It's typically the North American athlete
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.780]   who's more recognized.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.200]   - By the way. - Oh yeah.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.400]   - We'll have a cup here with some maple syrup.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.600]   - Cheers, Lex. - Cheers.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.460]   Which should probably show,
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.560]   you just downed that whole thing.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.760]   - No, no, no, I'm gonna sip it, I'm gonna sip it.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.400]   But by all means.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   - It's really good, right? - That is delicious.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.720]   - Yeah, that is-- - Canadian maple syrup.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.920]   - Yeah, that's a perfect July day
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.240]   from Canada in a bottle, yeah.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.640]   - So you're on a total tangent,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.960]   you are known for appreciating food in all kinds of ways,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.920]   but one of the things you're known for is pancakes.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   - That is, yeah, that's gone to a crazy place in the sport,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.640]   but yeah. - Where did that originate?
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.760]   - So where that originated--
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.360]   - When it went from your actual love for pancakes
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.520]   to the meme. - Yeah.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.960]   Yeah, so I think what happened was,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.520]   so I had a match with Michael Todd, big match.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.220]   Michael, great champion.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.720]   He's another guy who's,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.480]   he's never gonna get off the horse.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.800]   His elbow is a complete disaster.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.920]   Probably one of the most loved and hated guys
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.240]   in the sport right now.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.680]   - Is it because of the King's move?
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.880]   - Yeah. - One of the--
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.560]   - Yeah, the King's move brings him a lot of hate.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.800]   Not from me, not from a lot of people,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.200]   but a lot of observers have a big problem
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.560]   with the King's move.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.000]   - What's wrong with being a little bit controversial?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   That's fun.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.360]   - I get so passionate about it.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.600]   I get so angry, you know?
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.640]   'Cause there's this saying like,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.000]   "Oh, can you beat him at a hook?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.840]   "Can you beat him?"
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.920]   Man, win.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.880]   - Yeah. - Win.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.160]   - That's all that matters. - That's it.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.400]   Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   If you can win with style, win with style.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.960]   But don't talk to me about anything but winning.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.200]   That's the priority.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.800]   - So you had this match with Michael Todd.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.400]   - Yeah, so I was in a terrible place.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.480]   I guess it was, I get so screwed up with the years.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.340]   It's 2022 now, right?
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.400]   - No, it's 2030.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.680]   What are you talking about?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.520]   - That's right.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.280]   I think it is actually 2030.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.360]   We're way ahead of schedule.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.200]   Oh, man.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.020]   - That's right.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.860]   So when was this?
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.680]   This was like a decade ago or no?
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.120]   - No, this is like a year and a bit ago.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.200]   - Oh, this is very recent.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.600]   - Very recent, yeah.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.120]   So I got really sick.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.960]   - Is that the match?
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.760]   - Yeah, this is the match, right?
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   Awesome match.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.600]   So this match is for the Legacy Hammer.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.160]   So we invented this thing called the Legacy Hammer
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.720]   and Michael took it from me in, I think, 2018.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.360]   And then COVID shut everything down
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.600]   and Michael went overseas to try and set up,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.100]   'cause at that time, Michael was a North American champion.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.640]   He beat me and he went to Dubai
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.560]   and he organized this great big match with Levan.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.040]   And the whole thing fell apart.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.800]   Organizers, leagues, wouldn't let it happen,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.940]   but there was still an ability to have a match
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.500]   of significance happen.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.800]   So Michael's like, "Who do you want?"
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.640]   And I'm like, "Let's give Devin a rematch."
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.360]   And I'm like, "Yeah, yes!"
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.880]   And I was really sick at the time.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.960]   I had DVT, I had pulmonary embolism,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.280]   I was mentally in a terrible place
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.000]   and I got offered the match
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.300]   and I just totally turned my life around.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:55.300]   And I committed really hard.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.400]   - Yeah.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.880]   What happened in this match, by the way?
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.800]   - Oh, I just totally destroyed him.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.640]   (laughing)
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.800]   Yeah, I just beat the piss out of him.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.040]   Michael's a good friend of mine, but--
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.600]   - Yeah, there's a lot of camaraderie
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.480]   you guys talked afterwards, it's great.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.240]   - But we fight like brothers, you know?
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.400]   So we let each other really fight hard against each other.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.240]   But so I was, I knew, I mean,
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.360]   strength and mass, they go hand in hand.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.800]   And I committed to just getting as big
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   and as strong as I could.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.000]   And literally I was eating pancakes every day.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.120]   Bacon, pancakes, every sloppy bit of garbage food
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.960]   I could eat.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.440]   I was trying to eat healthy also,
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   but if there was garbage food, I'd eat it.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.340]   - What do you mean bacon and pancakes isn't healthy?
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.180]   What are you talking about?
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.020]   - Exactly.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.680]   - People should go watch, there's a video
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.680]   where you make the Canadian meal of bacon
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.400]   with some bacon cooking tips, water,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.240]   that was interesting.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.080]   - Yeah.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.360]   - And then obviously pancakes and maple syrup
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.200]   all over the whole thing.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.480]   - Yeah.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.080]   You're making me very hungry, Lex.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.360]   I've caused more diabetes than, you know,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.600]   probably gonna get in trouble karmically
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.680]   for making the world obese.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   - You should probably write like a book,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.640]   "The Pancake Diet" with Devin Laird.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.760]   - Yeah, I think I will do that one day.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.680]   - So you said mass and strength go hand in hand,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.240]   just at a big level about arm wrestling.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.120]   What's more important, strength, power, endurance,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.760]   skill, strategy, or mental toughness?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.520]   Like how do these components all come into play
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.680]   in arm wrestling?
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.280]   - They're all important.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.920]   You can use everything and you can adjust your strategy
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.840]   based off of the tools that you have.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.280]   I would say if I could pick ever just one thing
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   to have more of, I would say that it would be strength
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.240]   gained while fighting.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.080]   - While actually arm wrestling, so not off the top.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   - No, no, no.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.120]   So you get stronger from arm wrestling.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.640]   - How do you get stronger from arm wrestling?
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.080]   Like in jiu-jitsu and grappling, you can get good
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.000]   by training with people much technically worse than you.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.640]   So with white belts and blue belts.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.480]   - Yeah.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.320]   - It's actually beneficial.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.160]   - Agree.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.000]   - 'Cause you get to work stuff out.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.840]   - Right.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.840]   - But I wouldn't say it develops like that intensity
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.960]   and power required to go against people at your level.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.080]   So how do you balance that?
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.160]   Is it okay to go against people that are much weaker
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.440]   than you or do you really have to go against people
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.040]   at the same level?
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   - I think that a blended strategy is probably the best.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.520]   I'd say kind of a rule is whatever you do,
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.880]   you get better at, right?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.200]   So you wanna be kind of as precise as possible.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.520]   You don't wanna get hurt.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.680]   And it's just about investment.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.240]   And the answer is not always the same.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.280]   Things are gonna change.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.280]   I am currently a big believer in what I call tower building.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.240]   Right, so you have to do a lot of volume
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.720]   to build a great tower.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.760]   You need to have a ton, a ton of volume.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.200]   So when you look at how to best build volume,
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.480]   you want to do workouts that aren't particularly challenging
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.720]   that make you feel good and do them so that
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.160]   when you add them all together, you get the biggest number.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   So many easy workouts a day that are as specific as possible
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.480]   in my opinion is the best way to lay the foundation
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.040]   for an extreme peak.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.920]   And precision, right?
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.680]   Like there's no more precise way to get strong
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.440]   at arm wrestling than arm wrestle.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.600]   - So how often can you arm wrestle?
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.160]   What's your training regimen?
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.800]   You've talked about this as the climb.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   What is the training process to get great at arm wrestling?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.320]   - Well, again, it's gonna depend on what level you're at.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.600]   The answer at the beginning might not be the same.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.120]   For me, a guy who's been doing it almost 30 years,
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.520]   I have to harvest.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.380]   I have to harvest energy from clubs.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.400]   I call it cosmic punch.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.360]   - Sorry to interrupt, you were here in Austin, Texas.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.440]   You are in Austin, Texas, but you were at the,
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.280]   what was it called?
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.960]   The water tank. - The water tank, yeah.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.280]   - And you had an awesome crowd.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.200]   - It was great.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   - I get to watch, I got to interact with a lot of those guys.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.160]   Just amazing community, amazing human beings.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.960]   I got to talk to Dmitry in Russian and in English.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.080]   He's an engineer, his wife is an engineer,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.820]   so he's a brilliant dude, but also one of the toughest,
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.560]   I guess, guys you faced there.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.800]   But you faced, I don't know how many people.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.640]   It must have been hundreds of matches.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.360]   - So the bar was full.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.880]   Yeah, and that for me is a perfect training scenario.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.680]   So if I go in and just kind of be,
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.320]   I'm like a lightning rod, and I just absorb
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.600]   everything that I can get from people, all their effort,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.040]   that's perfect, that's perfect.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.680]   But I'm lucky because I'm in a place that I can handle it.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.720]   If I was losing or failing, this would not be optimal.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.840]   But because I'm strong enough, I've been doing it long
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.400]   enough that I can kind of absorb it without damaging me,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.840]   this is perfect, this is perfect.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.920]   I typically, when I'm training up for a very serious match,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.880]   I'll try and do that three or four times a week.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.720]   And then the days in between, I will just do
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.560]   blood flow rehab, blood flow rehab.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.040]   I will never hit a PR, a record, I'll never do it anymore.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.320]   I don't do it.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.880]   I used to, a lot of things change, and that's why I say
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.760]   there's a lot of ways to do it.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.520]   This is currently a system that's working very well for me.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.960]   - So when you say PR, you're not aggressively chasing a peak,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.000]   you're just building and building and building.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   - Yeah, my only peak that I care about is for this cycle,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.960]   the 25th of June, that's my only PR.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.600]   - Let's talk about the 25th of June.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.780]   - Oh yeah.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   - Let's talk about Levon Siganishvili, the Georgian Hulk.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:42.500]   Question number one, is it possible to beat him?
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.500]   He is widely acknowledged as the most powerful person
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.640]   in arm wrestling today.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.880]   Is he beatable?
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.940]   And if so, how?
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.280]   - Everybody's beatable, everybody's beatable.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.800]   Levon is incredible.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   He is what this modern peak of arm wrestling represents.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.760]   - So for people who are just listening,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.800]   we also have an overlay of a video of Levon going
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.160]   against Vitaly Leletin, another top three person
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.400]   in the world, perhaps, in arm wrestling.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.560]   And Levon is the guy on the right, just big.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.560]   - I love it.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.760]   - And the aggression, I mean, actually,
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.300]   sort of underneath it all, he seems to be a teddy bear,
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:36.300]   but when he turns it on, it's raw power.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.000]   - He's the full package.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.980]   Levon is, he represents the pinnacle.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.000]   There's Dennis in the background.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.080]   He's like, I wanna be back in there.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.120]   Levon has a lot of bases covered.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.160]   I mean, he's curling 300 pounds with one arm.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.040]   I mean, the strength that he shows for arm wrestling
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:04.820]   is so far ahead of the field, is very, very strong.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:11.520]   But it's absolutely possible, it's absolutely possible.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.120]   The one thing that I'm confident about,
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.080]   well, I'd say there's two things.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.800]   The two things I'm confident about is that I have
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.240]   more experience than he does.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   And experience counts for a lot.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.280]   The other thing is my ability to breathe and recover.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.840]   So if ever there's an opportunity for the tide to turn,
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.120]   that's, I think, where he'll never get it back.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   So I think if I can somehow find a hole in his game,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.880]   then yeah.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.360]   - So you want to hold off the initial assault of power
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.360]   and then wear him out to find the hole and then,
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.280]   how much of that is mental, how much of it is just
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.360]   the physical ability to do, for your muscles
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.260]   to have the endurance to hold off?
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.360]   - I like to make the sport bigger.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.160]   And a lot of things that most arm wrestlers
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.120]   believe the sport is, I always try and push
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.060]   those boundaries.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.440]   So there is definitely a mental aspect to it
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.160]   when you're faced with something that you've never
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   seen before, that's when things like experience comes in.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.800]   He can become surprised, where what's a surprise for him
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.520]   is routine for me.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.980]   So my adjustments will be more precise, more accurate.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.920]   Yeah, that's how I get in, that's how I get in.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.740]   Yeah, I play a dirty game.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.240]   - So some of it, how important is confidence
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.400]   in the progression of the match?
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.200]   Is there ups and downs of confidence?
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.360]   Like, holy shit, I actually have a chance to win this.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.360]   Holy shit, I'm winning this, you're done.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.280]   There's some of my favorite moments,
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.960]   I don't know if those are fake or not
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.240]   in terms of your expressions, if it's fake
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.160]   until you make it, but whenever you shake your head
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.880]   or whatever, you make it apparent that you believe
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.600]   the match is finished.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.700]   And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.440]   When you start to actually, so I'm sure you're doing
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.380]   things, like precise, detailed things with your hands
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.320]   to also indicate that you believe they're finished.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.000]   But you're facially just--
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.100]   - See this? - Yeah.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.440]   Quit.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.160]   Oh, that's right, 'cause it's facing the other--
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.400]   (laughing)
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.120]   So that's ultimately what the battle is about.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.800]   It's like, you're done, you might as well give up.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.840]   - Commitment is so important in anything that you do, right?
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.680]   Like, I always kind of try and bring things
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.320]   to a level of commitment that's uncommon.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.800]   I think that that's a lot of reasons why I do well,
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.640]   is 'cause I just get so committed in the whole process.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.400]   And by the time that I actually show up to fight,
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.240]   I sometimes just wish that they would kill me.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.040]   I wish that they would, because that's how far I wanna go.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.560]   People talk about how committed are you to the match.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.360]   If you're committed to the match and you lose,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.280]   you should be hurt.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   That's, I'm often unhappy when I lose a match
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.400]   and I don't have an injury.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.680]   I'm like, damn, what the fuck, I shoulda,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.500]   I feel like I didn't commit.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:50.320]   - I don't know if you know Dan Gable is the wrestler.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.680]   - Oh yeah, he was on--
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.840]   - He was on the podcast? - Yeah.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.920]   He talked about his whole career.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.160]   He dreamed of working so hard that he gets,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.600]   he can't get off the mat by himself.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.140]   And he's disappointed ultimately at the end of his career
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.160]   because he was always able to get off the mat
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.540]   on his own accord.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.200]   So he wants to, yeah, leave it all on the mat
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.000]   just from exhaustion.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.160]   So that's what commitment looks like.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.000]   - Yeah.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.460]   - What is this process, what is this climb
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.460]   for probably the toughest match of your career?
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.520]   I would say the most epic match in arm wrestling history.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.800]   I mean, it's really building up.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.840]   You are, you said North America, that's,
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.760]   I mean, I think by accounts of many,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   you're one of the greatest arm wrestlers ever.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.280]   He is one of the scariest arm wrestlers ever.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.200]   And so this match, by the way, where is it happening?
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.040]   - It'll be in Dubai.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.920]   - In Dubai. - Yeah.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.480]   - June, so what does the climb look like?
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.800]   - The climb for me, what I have to change in my life
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.040]   always, people talk about being a professional.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   I've always loved the sport.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.180]   I've loved it like crazy.
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:14.280]   But to me, the path is about simplicity
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.840]   and removal of distractions.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   I do better and better the more I get rid of everything,
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.440]   nothing else.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   So that my life is just the goal, just the target
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.160]   and everything else is off the table.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.820]   And that's where I need to get to,
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.920]   where there's nothing, there's nothing between me and him.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.600]   - And every single day you're putting in the volume.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   - Every day, all day.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.640]   - Now you said you worked out.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.360]   So yesterday you did hundreds of arm wrestling matches.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.560]   And then today you said in the morning you still worked out.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.680]   So what was that workout?
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.600]   So you're mixing up stuff where you're doing weights also?
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.000]   - This morning, I try to really focus on
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.520]   what's administratively easy.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.480]   That's a big part of me, everything I do.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.920]   So I just travel with bands.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.760]   Yeah, I got bands with me.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.360]   And it's rehabilitative in nature.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.480]   So I'm really focusing on blood flow,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.680]   feeling good, doing proper movements.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.920]   But yeah, just a band workout in the hotel room.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.440]   - What does a band workout look like?
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.800]   So are you doing the arm wrestling movement?
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.640]   Are you doing more curls? - Oh, see that?
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.760]   See what you did there?
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.600]   - What's that?
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.560]   - Yeah, it's--
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.680]   - Bet you wanna bring him in.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.920]   - Yeah, up, up.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.760]   Oh, the up thing?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.600]   - Up, up, up.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.360]   - Up into your center, right?
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.960]   You think, what can you control out here?
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.760]   No, you bring everything close.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.880]   You want every, just that's it.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.720]   Don't worry about pinning.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.560]   Pinning happens once it's close to you.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.280]   Yeah, pinning is, people always think about pinning.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.200]   Don't think about pinning.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.040]   - How much of the body is a part of this too?
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.640]   Like the core, the torso?
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.480]   'Cause it feels like there's that
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.680]   almost like Mike Tyson punch power, right?
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   Does it come from the hips too and the legs?
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   Is it the whole body? - It's definitely
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.600]   the whole body.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.120]   It's definitely the whole body.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.560]   Like everything is working.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   You're connected to the table at times,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.400]   as far as your base.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.360]   Sometimes your base is your feet.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.600]   But a lot of times you can base off the table.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.960]   So you can base off your hips.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.760]   But I'll tell you, no arm wrestler
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.040]   cares about doing squats.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.320]   No arm wrestler's doing planks.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.400]   Okay, it's all about the forearm
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.000]   and the actions of the hand.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.200]   That's always the limiting factor.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.320]   You look at a guy like Oleg Zok.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.720]   Okay, do you know this guy?
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.160]   Oleg Zok, marvelous.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.400]   He's a total hell boy.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.320]   He's my inspiration to what I call pumpkin training.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.160]   But. - What's pumpkin training?
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.720]   - Probably we'll get into that.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.680]   But I only train my right arm, that's it.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.080]   Yeah, with homework.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.520]   But back to full body, it is full body.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.000]   My good friend Matt Mask, when he arm wrestled me,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   he actually blew his internal abductor in his leg.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.120]   So yeah, people walk away from tournament,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.480]   their calves can be sore sometimes.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.760]   You know, it happens.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.880]   But no, oh, there he is right there.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.920]   Yeah, Oleg, he is a real life hell boy.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.440]   He's like 170 pounds there.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.440]   Look at his arm, look at his arm.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.680]   - It's crazy.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.600]   - Yeah, yeah, he's totally crazy.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.000]   - That's you doing left right there.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.640]   So by the way, Levan, you're going right.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.160]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.560]   So can you say more about the mental side?
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.280]   Are you visualizing what it takes to beat him?
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   Are you trying to get in his head?
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.840]   All of these things.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.360]   So do you think it's possible to get in his head?
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.760]   - There's definitely strategies that you can do
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.400]   depending on who it is you're facing.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.040]   It's very good to know who it is you're fighting
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.620]   and choose the correct strategy mentally.
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:06.480]   But I always follow a process
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.120]   when it comes to my mental preparation.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.680]   When I'm far away from an event,
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.440]   I just always build up my opponent.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.200]   Build them, I build them, I respect them.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.520]   To a point where I almost start to fear them
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.520]   and start to believe that they'll beat me.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.160]   And this is a very vital part of my preparation.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.520]   And that's where I am right now with Levan.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.400]   I just build them up,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.600]   build them up into this thing that scares me.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.880]   And it forces me to be responsible,
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.800]   'cause I don't wanna lose, I wanna win.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.920]   So the greater my opponent,
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.080]   the greater I can build their worth in my mind,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.640]   the more motivation it gives me.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.840]   Then there comes a point when it changes.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   And then I start to degrade them.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.020]   And yeah, that's when it normally starts to get fun.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.660]   And normally by the time I face them,
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.880]   I just try and completely dominate
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.700]   from every interaction from start to finish.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.200]   - When in the actual moment of the match,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.640]   like in the moments leading up to it,
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.080]   what's the feeling?
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.400]   Is it fear?
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.000]   Is it confidence, anxiety?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.560]   What's going through your mind?
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.000]   - I love to fight.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.840]   I love it.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.640]   I always have.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:41.360]   There's every day where you have the distractions of life,
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.000]   and then there's really living in the moment, right?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.480]   It's whatever you love to do.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.600]   And that's when you can really be free.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.080]   I'm free when I'm fighting, right?
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.040]   So you put me in a good fight, and I just love it.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.240]   And I don't think about the past,
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.360]   I don't think about the future.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.640]   I just think about killing that dude in front of me,
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.720]   and I enjoy that.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.800]   - And just being intensely in the moment.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.640]   - That's it.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.380]   Just right there, just fighting as hard as I can.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.040]   - Do you study the opponent?
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.440]   Have you for this particular match,
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.720]   do you study videos of LeVon?
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.640]   - I've seen everything.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.020]   I've read everything.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.000]   I get opinions from other people.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.360]   I watch very closely, yeah.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.160]   - What do you make of his evolution?
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.560]   So he's grown in size,
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.360]   but also you've talked about his evolution
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.460]   technically as well.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:42.400]   In studying him, since we're in the build your opponent
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   to beat terrifying stage, what makes him great?
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.000]   - He's very impressive.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.660]   The greatest thing about him is his strength.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.680]   That's the thing that sets him apart from everyone.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.960]   His strength, specialized strength,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.840]   exact strength for arm wrestling.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.960]   I believe it's unmatched.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   - Can we just linger on that word strength?
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.840]   What does strength mean?
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.120]   What does it feel like?
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.120]   Are we talking about bicep, like shoulder?
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.240]   Are we talking about whatever controls, the wrist?
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.800]   Is it the, how does strength manifest?
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.740]   You know, when I touch your hand, when we grab arms,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.120]   I feel like, fuck, that's strong.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:36.960]   - There's control, right?
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.840]   - What is that feeling?
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.080]   Where does that come from in arm wrestling?
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.720]   When you're at the top of the world,
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.920]   where does that come from?
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.840]   - So it's chains.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.560]   There's chains of strength.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.480]   And in arm wrestling, this is like technical strength.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.460]   And we use these technical chains to fight each other.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:58.440]   The chains that I'll talk about is,
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.000]   so you'll talk, remember how we talked about the post,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   this upwards drive, this ability to close this angle?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.020]   This is a chain.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.940]   It can be used, it's a technical attack.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.600]   It's also an attack that can be built with training.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   Just the ability to just drive upwards.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.740]   There's a chain where you cup, right?
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.920]   Cup your wrist in.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.000]   Cup your wrist in, and the anchor in the chain
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.160]   brings you right to your heart, right to your center.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.920]   This chain, and this can be done at any time.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.040]   There's a pronation chain,
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.320]   and that's to turn your thumb over.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.360]   Turn your thumb over,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.320]   and you attack the person's cupping chain.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.840]   - And there's a huge number of muscles
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.160]   involved in each of those chains.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.240]   - And that's why I say it's a chain, right?
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.060]   But they're movements, and these movements,
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.360]   you can develop in the gym or through practice.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.680]   - So you don't mean,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.840]   so it's easy to sort of interpret strength
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.960]   to mean how much you curl, essentially.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.800]   - Yeah.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.760]   - But you mean the chain.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.600]   It all has to do with the--
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.800]   - Right, and that's, I mean, people talk, is it a bicep?
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.860]   I mean, yes, there's bicep for sure involved,
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.360]   but I'll always be inaccurate
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.120]   if I try and tell you what muscles are the,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.800]   so I prefer to explain it in a movement,
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.720]   and then everything that's involved to do that movement.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   Right?
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.360]   Yeah, and LeVon's movements for arm wrestling
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.320]   are incredibly impressive.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   - What do you attribute to, how much of that is genetics,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   how much of it is some training thing he's doing?
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.920]   - I think that LeVon is very special
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.960]   in terms of his genetics.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.100]   Like, not everybody can be LeVon, you know?
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.940]   - Yeah.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.320]   - There's not many LeVons out there.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.960]   But what I've encountered in the bias that I always see,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.040]   like when people talk about people like LeVon,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.440]   they discount the other side so very quickly.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.480]   And the thing is, LeVon rarely has to show the other side
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.540]   because he's so far ahead.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.280]   You talk about the technical application of the sport,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.460]   he so rarely needs to show it, but he's clearly incredible.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:07.820]   If you watch his progression, he came up
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.080]   having very difficult technical struggles to overcome.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.880]   Georgia is a great country for arm wrestling.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.360]   Like, there's this guy Gennady Kvikvinia,
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.980]   who no one would ever say is not technical.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.680]   And, you know, it took him years to defeat him,
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.960]   to a point where now it's not even a discussion.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.240]   - Yeah, you talk about the progression,
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.360]   they had a lot of battles together over the years.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.200]   - Yeah.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.000]   - It's fascinating to see the tides turn.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.740]   - Oh yeah, and once they've turned,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.880]   it's like completely, completely different level.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.740]   Yeah, I mean, he's got strength, he's got technique.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:48.660]   Some people will argue that his technique is flawed.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.780]   At times, they've shown matches where
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.940]   he hasn't shown the best technique, but he's still won.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.700]   And I think sometimes he just plays with people, you know.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.180]   Like, there's a famous match that he had with,
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.580]   oh, they call him the Bruce Lee of arm wrestling,
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.620]   a guy called Ongarbaev, Kyrgyzstan Ongarbaev.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.660]   They had a match in the top eight, great match.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.580]   Kyrgyzstan is like 220 pound guy from Kazakhstan,
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.900]   brilliant technician, but power-wise,
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.580]   you know, not in the same world.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.700]   And Kyrgyzstan did well, even though he lost six nothing.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.780]   He still did well.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.940]   But in my opinion, Levon didn't care.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.840]   Levon was like grabbing him low and just like, whatever.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.180]   I will show him things that he's not seen before, I will.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.980]   He hasn't competed often in this rule set,
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.680]   which will be a challenge for him.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.020]   But yeah, what can I say?
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.460]   Like, Levon, he's Everest.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.820]   - Yeah. - Yeah?
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.180]   - Yeah, you are seen by, basically,
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.220]   everybody is the big, big underdog.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.820]   But you're also, even in the Eastern,
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.500]   even, I mean, I talk to Russians a lot.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.260]   You know that moment in "Rocky"
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.700]   when they start cheering for Rocky?
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.980]   - Yeah, yeah. (laughing)
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.020]   - You're kind of the, they love you, they want you to win.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.720]   And just, you know, it's not even,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.500]   just the battle itself is inspiring.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.780]   And it's like the culmination of your career,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.980]   because you're at the top for a long time,
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.860]   but it's like, it's almost like it should be over for you.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.140]   But no, you're returning.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.620]   It is like this big moment.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.060]   - Yeah. - The big climb.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.580]   - I will be the pointy end of the spear for North America.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.900]   (laughing)
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.780]   - Beautiful, well, let's,
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.700]   thanks for bringing that match up.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.340]   Let's talk about just
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:51.620]   the match against Dennis, your left-hand match.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.660]   - Yeah. - He's also terrifying,
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.940]   and seen as one of the strongest,
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.140]   probably the one of, if not the strongest,
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.820]   left-hand arm wrestler.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.660]   - Yeah.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.820]   - There's a lot to be said there.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.340]   Maybe you could talk about this match at a high level.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.060]   Why did you take on this match?
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.900]   Why did you do the left hand versus the right hand?
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.340]   Can you tell the story?
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.060]   - Okay, Dennis Zaplankov.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.100]   There's so much about this match.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.260]   I love Dennis.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.340]   - Russian guy.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.540]   - Yeah, Russian guy.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.380]   Russian, I used to call him Dennis Chernobyl.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.620]   (laughing)
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.500]   What a monster.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   He kind of led, I'd say, this new era of arm wrestling,
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:37.660]   where the super heavyweight strength level
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.260]   has just gone through the roof.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.220]   I wanted the match for such a long time.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.300]   We tried to get the match.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.500]   We couldn't get it organized.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.660]   This is back in 2008 to 2012.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.500]   Couldn't get the match, couldn't get the match.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.380]   I've always been more of a one-on-one puller.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.140]   He was doing the tournament format.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.220]   I was ranked number one in the world.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.580]   And towards the end, it kind of was very undecided.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.260]   I ended up getting surgery.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.220]   I ended up abandoning the super heavyweight division.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.380]   I went down to 225s for a few years.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.960]   WAL failed temporarily.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.820]   So the 225 pound division was scrapped.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.820]   And I said, okay, I'm gonna go for the big crown once again.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.700]   And I started to go after super heavyweights.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:31.020]   The 2018 season was right hand.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:38.100]   I started to enter negotiations to have the match with him.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.060]   We'd been chasing the match for 10 years.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.320]   They wanted to do it left hand.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.380]   I wanted to do it right hand.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.340]   I just wanted to do the match.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.600]   I wanted to do the match with Dennis.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.820]   I wanted to meet Dennis.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.660]   - So people should know that the right hand
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.620]   has always been your strongest.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.220]   - It has been.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.580]   I mean, I had surgery in 2016.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.260]   I hate to make excuses.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.360]   I hate to do it.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:05.100]   Dennis was better than me that day, even on my best day.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.880]   If you had gone back my entire career,
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:11.660]   at no single day do I beat Dennis Zaplankov in 2018.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.380]   I would like to think that I could maybe do it now.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.820]   But at that point, there would be no version
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.700]   that could have beat him.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.500]   - Left or right?
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.900]   - Right hand, no.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.660]   I'm curious about the right.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.500]   But left hand.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.400]   - So is the world.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.580]   - Well, it might still happen.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.460]   It might.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:34.460]   But Dennis completely destroyed me.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:39.860]   And I learned a lot from it.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:45.460]   I think before the Dennis match,
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.020]   I think I was, I don't know.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.860]   I don't know exactly what words to use.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.960]   Maybe I felt like my thinking was a little bit elitist.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.100]   And I really learned a lot.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.900]   I was really humbled that day
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.620]   by how far and how professional
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.100]   and how prepared Dennis was.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.460]   And how seriously he took the sport.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:14.460]   - There's a mental, a slightly terrifying calmness to him,
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.900]   which only comes with extreme preparation, I think.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.100]   - Yeah, his level of dedication
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.460]   was extremely inspiring to me.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:31.300]   I used to do a job where it was serious enough
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:37.740]   that the price could be death, right?
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.660]   And I arm wrestled throughout that entire period.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:46.660]   And I always kind of looked at the cost
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:53.260]   of doing an activity being death, limited to soldiering.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:41:00.340]   And I kind of changed my mind a lot after that match.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.660]   I realized that anything that you're in love with,
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.700]   once you get far enough down the road
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.980]   and professional enough at it, it's gonna kill you.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.420]   Doesn't matter what you're doing.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.780]   If you're crazy enough about anything,
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.620]   it's probably gonna take your life from you in some way.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.340]   And that doesn't mean you rush towards death.
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.140]   It's just your level of investment and level of risk
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.580]   can have some catastrophic effects.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.100]   - Bukowski, Charles Bukowski, I think has the quote,
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.980]   "Do what you love and let it kill you."
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.940]   - Right. - Like that.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.420]   - Right.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:40.420]   And I understood that Dennis's level of professionalism
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:44.780]   far exceeded mine in what we were doing at the time.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:50.380]   And I realized that I was no longer employed.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.340]   I was now in the world of professional arm wrestling.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.700]   And I realized that what was I doing?
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.580]   Like how serious was I?
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.820]   So Dennis is an incredible guy.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.540]   - Is there moments in that match,
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.740]   there's this humility there too from him.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.660]   That was a fascinating sort of,
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.540]   it seemed like you realized that you just hit a wall
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.180]   and you were not ready enough for it.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.860]   - It was incredible.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.620]   There was so many things that I remember
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.020]   about the Dennis match.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.180]   I mean, I remember seeing video of somebody
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.140]   and then meeting them in person, it's different.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.260]   I remember in the weigh-ins, sorry, not the weigh-ins,
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.900]   in the standoff that we did before the match,
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.620]   I'm looking at him, I'm close, I'm looking at his arms.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.620]   And his bicep, it looked like an ass.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.500]   Like it was like a fricking glute muscle.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.100]   Like his entire structure was so sinewy
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.620]   and just so strong.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.140]   I was like, wow, physically so impressive.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.460]   And I remember when I arm wrestled him
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:04.460]   at a certain time, he allowed me to kind of set my position.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:09.260]   You can't really tell 'cause it happens very quickly,
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.740]   but he let me set my position,
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.460]   which means I kind of got my locks in
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.200]   where you can kind of really do a great hold.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.340]   And he just ripped through me.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.900]   - So you were able to get this great position.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.220]   So it was-- - Tore right through me.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:30.700]   Yeah, and the first time I ever thought
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.220]   that I had torn something,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.540]   I thought like after the match,
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.100]   I'm like, "Jeez, did he rip my chest right in half?"
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.420]   - What, did it?
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.140]   - No, I think-- - It was 100% chest?
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.860]   - Yeah, no, I didn't actually,
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.940]   nothing went purple or anything,
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.940]   but yeah, the strength gap was very significant with Dennis.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:56.140]   - So could he, what would it take to beat him on that day?
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:02.280]   - It would take me just being a little bit stronger,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.600]   - More focused. - and more healthy, yeah.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.000]   My left was not as healthy as it should be.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.840]   Like I didn't have a full rounded technical arsenal.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.480]   It takes a time after surgery, it really does.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.800]   Like, I mean, you can be good,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.960]   but after a surgery like what I had,
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.160]   you're probably looking at three or four years
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.800]   before you're starting to hit technical proficiency
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.900]   the way you should be.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.240]   And yeah, just a bit stronger.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.720]   - How do you interpret the calmness on his face?
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.200]   What is that about?
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.040]   Is he actually that calm? - It's very Russian, isn't it?
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.280]   - It's a Russian thing? - It's a Russian thing,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.320]   I think, I don't know.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.800]   I see a lot of Russians like that,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.680]   you know, they're so like stoic.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.800]   And I'm such a fan of Russia,
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.520]   I really wanna go to Moscow, I've been saying it forever.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.280]   - You've never been? - Not yet, not yet.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.960]   I wanna go, I wanna just go and live there
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.440]   for like a month and just train.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.600]   Moscow's got such a crazy arm wrestling scene.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.680]   They've got, from what I understand,
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.720]   they just have so many clubs,
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.600]   there's so many strong athletes.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.000]   Just go and just lightning rod, yeah.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   - Have you considered doing something of that sort,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.840]   it's like Rocky IV again?
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.680]   - Oh yeah.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.960]   - Like, and lead up to June?
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.580]   - I would certainly consider it.
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.100]   I've got only one trip planned at the moment.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:22.880]   Administration is very important.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.080]   - What do you mean by administration?
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.360]   So like managing your time?
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.960]   - Management, yeah, the management has to be very efficient.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.900]   You know, when I'm a tourist, when I'm a visitor,
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.400]   a little bit of that goes down.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.160]   You know, when I'm at my home and things are familiar,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.880]   I've got a really great grasp on my time.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.960]   You know, everything's in place, everything's perfect.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.320]   You know, if I could magically transport Moscow
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.120]   into my hometown and just go out and visit them, yeah.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.480]   - So it's very difficult when you're traveling,
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.160]   you have to keep all the,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.840]   you have to figure out what are you eating,
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.520]   how are you getting the food, all the socializing,
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.000]   plus you're more and more a celebrity,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.760]   so there's social interaction,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.520]   which I don't know how draining that could be on you
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.600]   outside of the arm wrestling table.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.640]   So you have to manage all of that
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.960]   'cause ultimately you have to focus on the fight ahead.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.520]   - Yeah, yeah, a lot of my strength comes
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.320]   from just being in a familiar place, doing my routine.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.760]   I love to travel.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   I love to get out there and meet people and new experiences,
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.400]   but when I just wanna really prepare for a big match,
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.640]   yeah, home is where I get strong.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.360]   - So that loss against Dennis
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.920]   was one of the few losses in your career.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:45.200]   How did that feel in the moments after,
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.400]   in the days after, in the months after,
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.600]   in the years after, how has it changed you
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.480]   as an arm wrestler, as a human being?
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.240]   - Well, it's tough to lose.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.300]   - Still haunt you?
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.720]   - I don't think so.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.240]   I actually was really happy to lose to Dennis
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.520]   because sometimes when you lose a match,
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.360]   there's a lot of matches that I've lost
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.120]   where they upset me because I know I made a mistake.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.360]   I didn't make a mistake with Dennis.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.280]   He was just way better.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.760]   There's nothing I could have done that day.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.200]   I'm really at peace with it.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.280]   Dennis, to me, was just a big inspiration.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.240]   I think that me arm wrestling Dennis left-handed that day
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.600]   just let me touch probably one of the strongest
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.320]   human beings on the arm wrestling table that's ever lived,
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.160]   left-handed.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:40.000]   - So knowing that's possible is almost like
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.400]   inspiration to you that I can be at that level too.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.800]   Seeing what Dennis did,
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.720]   just trying to absorb a little bit of his knowledge,
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.720]   planted seeds in me.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.960]   Yeah, I mean, when I look at my career,
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.040]   it's a bit like the stock market,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.080]   but for sure I'm trending upwards.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:07.080]   And since really kind of wrapping my mind around
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.200]   some of the Russian philosophies,
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.240]   they really changed my training systems.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.400]   There was some base philosophies
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.520]   that they talked to me about over there
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.640]   that massively impacted my training.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.960]   - Is it possible to convert some of those philosophies
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.800]   into words?
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.400]   Can you describe some of the ideas they taught you?
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.880]   - So-- - Never smile.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.520]   - Ah, right?
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.400]   Man, it's so, like, it takes a while to break the ice
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.640]   with a lot of these guys.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.760]   - Well, once you do, I mean,
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.840]   that's as deep as Bonsi can form there.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.640]   - Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.320]   I think that I was raised under,
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.440]   I believe it's a flawed, I mean, it's not flawed
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.500]   because it has its value as well,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:54.680]   but it's best if you understand both philosophies.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:59.640]   I think a North American thing that's just so ingrained
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   in our fitness society is no pain, no gain, you know?
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.400]   And just pushing and, like, sweating and going harder
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.760]   and, like, fighting through, like, and grit and tough,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.240]   but, and then you talk to the Russians
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.200]   and they're like, yeah, never fail.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.080]   You never fail.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.440]   Never go to failure.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.120]   Always feel good.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:23.960]   Always feel good.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.780]   It should always feel good.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.480]   Don't, and those two philosophies
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.620]   express themselves very differently.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:36.360]   And if you wanna get strong, yeah, don't fail.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.520]   Don't fail.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.640]   - So that's how you, they also are believers of volume.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.880]   - Yeah, there's a lot of strategies,
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.320]   but, you know, volume is a massive principle.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.560]   And volume is very hard to achieve
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.760]   when you're believing in no pain, no gain, right?
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.320]   They don't really go together.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.580]   No pain, no gain, more injuries.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.360]   - So the, is there parallels?
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.040]   'Cause in wrestling, some of the greatest wrestlers
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.400]   of all time are Russian, and they were big,
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.000]   Dan Gable talks about it, they were big on play,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.760]   like lighter wrestling, 'cause probably,
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.480]   ultimately, actually, it boils down to
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.320]   that's how you achieve higher volume.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.160]   - Right.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.240]   - Like over the stretch of years,
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.240]   the way to reduce injury,
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   I mean, in wrestling, also, technique might
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.200]   have greater value than it does in arm wrestling.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.760]   Obviously, technique, extremely important in arm wrestling,
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   but power is, like, can defeat technique, it seems like.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.560]   In wrestling, you can get away,
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.640]   there's a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks,
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.000]   sort of use leverage, all those kinds of things.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.880]   So there's even more incentive to do play
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.400]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.800]   But do you see the parallels between the two worlds?
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.460]   - Wrestling and arm wrestling?
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.300]   - 100%.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.480]   You saw what I did the other night, right?
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.220]   So I'm playing on the table for hours, right?
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:09.160]   So that's my number one training thing that I do,
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:13.080]   is I go on the table for hours and I play.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.000]   - Yeah.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.800]   Yeah, when you did, Sergey, can you pull up that video?
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.320]   It's on Devin's channel, the water tank one.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.120]   - Oh, it's like 180p.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.200]   It's like the wifi in there was so bad.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.040]   - Yeah.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.880]   - It's great, I love it.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.720]   It's maybe, I don't know if it was fisheye,
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.320]   but it had a fisheye feel.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.160]   - Yeah.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.560]   - Crowded, I mean, so much camaraderie.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.880]   It was amazing.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.240]   But maybe just a brief mention of Dmitry,
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.480]   the Russian guy.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:48.880]   In that play, what are some memorable things here?
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.240]   Like when you go against a bunch of different people,
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.000]   a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences?
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.440]   And how do you grow from them?
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.460]   How do you learn from them?
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.000]   - Well, everybody's a bit different.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.120]   So I love to go to new clubs
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.280]   'cause the energy's always high.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.120]   Like the first time you go to a club,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.480]   everybody's trying to kill you.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.320]   - Yeah.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.140]   - Yeah, so they're gonna--
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:09.980]   - There's excitement and there's this,
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.080]   and so you feed off of that.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:11.920]   - Yeah, you do.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.420]   You can, if you're able to be strong enough
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.040]   to absorb it without injury, it's awesome.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:17.880]   It's awesome.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.480]   - 'Cause they're giving you everything they can.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.760]   Yeah, right.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.040]   So it's very specific, right?
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.120]   Like I'm gonna get way stronger at arm wrestling.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.360]   And what I try and do when I go to these places
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.160]   is I make an assumption.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.120]   I make an assumption that I'm the best guy there.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:41.120]   And so I'll arm wrestle in a way that kind of protects them
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.400]   'cause the more I can protect them
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.320]   and kind of keep them kind of in a good position,
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.720]   they can actually give me more, right?
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.760]   So I kind of give them little pieces
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.480]   that I think will put them in a place
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.280]   that they can really give me more.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.420]   And so yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.040]   And then when I see somebody like Dimitri,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.200]   I pull that in a little bit, right?
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.660]   So, okay, so I know Dimitri's the number one guy in Texas.
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.320]   Lots of respect to the guy.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.000]   I won't give him all the pieces
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.800]   until I really kind of gauge where he's at
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.420]   because I certainly in training don't wanna fail.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.320]   I don't want that.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.880]   I don't want to, when you fail in arm wrestling,
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.480]   it's just, imagine it's just bad technique.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.080]   And you're trying and bad technique,
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.360]   you're gonna get hurt.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.000]   - You always wanna be in a strong position here.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.040]   What about, how does endurance come into play here?
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.960]   And here's video of you strapping up with Dimitri.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.800]   - Yeah.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   - How do you, I mean, you went for like,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:43.920]   I don't know, two hours?
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.880]   - Yeah, it was long.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.340]   So this first run of the video,
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.120]   I think was a little over an hour.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.280]   Then I took a break
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.600]   and I probably did another 45 minutes or so.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.440]   But I mean, do you, how can,
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.880]   are you okay with the endurance aspect of this?
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.320]   - Yeah, that's probably like,
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.720]   when you talk to the arm wrestling world,
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.040]   that's probably what I'm best known for is my endurance.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.120]   - So this helps build that.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.840]   - It does, but that's not why I'm doing it.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.040]   I'm doing it to get strong.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.760]   In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to get strong,
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.960]   especially far away from a tournament
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.380]   or any kind of an event.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:24.080]   I wouldn't wanna do this, you know,
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.000]   even a month or even six weeks
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.760]   or even maybe even eight weeks before a big event.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.320]   I'd wanna already be kind of shrinking my volume.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.720]   But far away from an event, yeah,
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.480]   as much volume as your body can handle,
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.360]   and you'll feel it, you'll feel it.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.580]   Like I felt it at times, like, you know,
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.120]   after the hour mark, I'm like, okay,
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.600]   I can feel my blood sugar kind of diminishing.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.700]   I can feel like the blood that's going to my muscles
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:53.340]   is kind of like, it's not really pushing more good stuff in,
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.160]   it's, I'm starting to break down.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.960]   And you don't want that, you don't want that.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.880]   - Quick pause, bathroom break?
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.720]   - I'm good, I'm good.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.600]   - Okay, I kind of need one.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.400]   - I'll maybe get a sweater, it's a bit.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.380]   - Is it cold?
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.520]   Does that matter, does that care for chemical?
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.360]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   - I can make it warmer.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.440]   - No, no, no, I'll just put a sweater on,
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.200]   it's fine, that doesn't matter.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.400]   - And I still love the idea of you going to Russia.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.240]   - Yeah.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.360]   - And training there.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.180]   - Yeah.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.880]   - I'm also making a trip out to Russia.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.720]   - Oh yeah, when?
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.680]   - For different, well, it's hard with the current conflict.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.520]   - Oh yeah.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.340]   - The tension's there,
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.720]   but I'm hoping before your match, actually, so May.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.560]   - Okay.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.320]   - For a couple of interviews with a couple of folks,
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.800]   some of which people know.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.000]   Maybe I could ask you about,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.040]   to comment on some matches that stand out to you
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.840]   in your career.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.680]   - Sure.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:48.400]   - Is there something, is there a particular,
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.040]   I have a bunch that I really enjoy,
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:54.280]   but is there something that stands out to you as memorable?
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:59.280]   We talked about sort of a defining loss, perhaps, to Dennis.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:05.680]   Then you faced Michael Tyler, who mentioned John Brzenk.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.740]   You faced Matt.
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.720]   Is there something that stands out to you
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.600]   that technically or psychologically
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.660]   you've learned a lot from?
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:20.320]   - I feel like I try and learn something from every match,
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.640]   but there is a very special match to me
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.020]   that to this day I can't explain.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:30.320]   Very weird phenomena.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.520]   So I think it was 2005,
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:38.720]   was my first combat tour overseas.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.560]   So it was a active tour,
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:47.680]   among other things, I got shot during that tour,
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:51.000]   like we got blown, a long tour, rough tour.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.560]   And I trained the whole time through
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.200]   knowing that at the end of this,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.960]   I was gonna have a big match.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:01.280]   So there's a champion, a guy called Ron Bath.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:05.040]   He's kind of, if there was no John Brzenk,
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.640]   there would be Ron Bath.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.200]   Okay, so extremely decorated,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   unbelievable arm wrestler from the United States.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.280]   And this is kind of when I was just
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.580]   kind of coming up in the sport still.
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:18.960]   I was fairly well established.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.040]   I was definitely the best guy in Canada.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   And I had been for a few years,
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.640]   but I hadn't really expanded internationally too much.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:32.400]   So I had a one-on-one match with Ron Bath,
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.360]   and that's the one, yeah.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   Extremely hard fought battle.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.600]   Was three-one, I think, three-one,
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.000]   but every match was really close.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.940]   And he won the first one,
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.140]   and I had to kind of dig my way out of the trenches
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.420]   and ended up coming back and winning.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.260]   But it was a match that was probably,
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.260]   it was probably one of my closest matches ever.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.740]   And it was--
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.340]   - It seems like there's frustration on you.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:03.180]   What is that?
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.720]   What was going through your mind here with these?
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.980]   Was it, first of all, going in,
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.860]   did you think you could beat him?
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:10.700]   What was the level of confidence?
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.140]   - I always think I can win.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.460]   Like I always do.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.900]   But a lot of respect to the guy.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.180]   But yeah, I mean, I always think I can do it.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:24.660]   - So what lessons did you take away from it?
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.400]   Why is it so meaningful to you?
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.580]   - Well, it's what happened afterwards.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.920]   So I had some kind of a release afterwards,
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:36.300]   and that was the strange thing to me.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:40.140]   So match ended,
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:44.820]   and I felt like so relaxed afterwards,
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:49.620]   so calm, so satisfied,
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.740]   because it was one of those matches
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.740]   that kind of takes everything from you, but you win it.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:58.880]   And I was relaxing in the chair,
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:03.500]   and I've never had this sensation before.
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.340]   I've never had it afterwards,
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:09.800]   but it's like the center of my backbone just exploded.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.640]   And it was like, so weird, right?
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.860]   'Cause I'm not really spiritual that much or religious even,
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.820]   but it's like a fire just ripped through me.
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.700]   And it only lasted an instant,
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.960]   just exploded through my whole body,
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.980]   out the top, through my feet, and then it was gone.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.620]   That was it.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.020]   Weirdest thing I've ever felt in my entire life.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:39.780]   Yeah, but it was as a result of what happened in the match
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.720]   and leading up to it, I had some kind of a release.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:48.340]   - How did you interpret it psychologically?
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:51.660]   Was it like some kind of,
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.620]   I mean, not to be spiritual or whatever,
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.460]   but some kind of superpower that was
[00:59:55.460 --> 01:00:01.240]   like a lingering feeling like, holy shit,
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:06.540]   - I can't explain it.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.420]   And I haven't really tried hard enough to try to.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.420]   - But something changed.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.380]   - Something happened there, yeah.
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.300]   Something happened to me,
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.660]   I was sore for about three or four months afterwards.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.420]   It's like it smoked out my entire body.
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.140]   Yeah, that whole summer I was kind of sore.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.420]   And yeah, and then after that,
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.940]   like two or three years later,
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.060]   that's when I won the world championships.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.660]   Yeah, I mean, all the matches are,
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.620]   you get something from people,
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.860]   you study them, you take something from them.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:42.660]   People have an invisible crown and he had one.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.220]   And I think I took it from him.
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.940]   - Maybe that was the feeling of wearing the crown.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.800]   - Yeah, maybe.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.140]   - What about all the trash talk?
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.620]   How much of that did you learn?
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.900]   Does that come naturally to you?
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.980]   You're one of the most charismatic, fun.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:00.060]   I mean, there's always like respect behind it.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.180]   I would say to me, and I'm a fan of a lot of sports,
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:05.460]   you're one of the greatest trash talkers
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.820]   in all of sports that I've ever seen
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.220]   because you're able to talk shit,
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.700]   but there's so much love and respect behind it.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.900]   It's just masterful.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.820]   But you also get into people's heads in the moment.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:20.780]   It's beautiful to watch 'cause it really gets,
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.240]   it gets to some people.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.460]   So where does that come from?
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.180]   - It's a powerful weapon, right?
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.020]   - Yeah.
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.820]   - Your voice is a powerful, powerful weapon.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.460]   And it's underutilized by so many athletes
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.900]   because they think that it's not sportsmanlike
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.220]   or something like that.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:42.220]   But the truth is, I mean, you can be a weak person,
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:46.660]   but with your voice, you can influence
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.820]   and change any number of things.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:52.380]   And the same thing happens in a fight between two people.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.700]   If you can just be a never ending flow
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:59.980]   of negative encouragement to someone,
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.980]   or suggestion, anything can happen.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.940]   It's a tool.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:11.320]   And when you're fighting a person,
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.380]   you're not just fighting them.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.860]   You're fighting everyone who's watching.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.260]   You're fighting the crowd, the referees.
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:24.260]   And to get in the most ideal positions, situations,
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:27.140]   you need to use your voice.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.500]   - There's a, for people who haven't seen,
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.020]   I definitely recommend you watch
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.300]   a bunch of arm wrestling matches
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.020]   'cause there's a crowd really gets into it.
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.940]   And it feels like there's a really intimate connection
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.340]   with the crowd, I suppose,
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.220]   because the crowd is allowed to be very close to you.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.980]   - Yeah, I love it.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.500]   I want the crowd right up on me.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.660]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.820]   - So sometimes, oh yeah.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.460]   So who are you, whenever you talk to somebody,
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.260]   do you literally pick somebody from the crowd?
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.460]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.340]   I'll start fucking off his fans.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:08.280]   I'll start talking to their wives or whatever.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.780]   Yeah, there's Jody.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:16.140]   She's pretty dangerous to listen to also.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.340]   But yeah, one of his buddies, Mike Solaris,
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:23.340]   who's a really good arm wrestler, was cheering for him.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.380]   So I started to go after him.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.220]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.780]   - Smiling the whole time.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.060]   - Yeah, it's fun, right?
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.900]   It's fun.
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.780]   - It's a fan, it's fun to listen to.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.340]   But it's also, what's fun is how much it actually affects
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.660]   some of the people you're facing.
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.740]   They get frustrated.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.140]   - Yeah. - It's great to see.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.880]   - Well, you have to fight, right?
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.980]   Like a lot of people think things will be given to them.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.140]   And the thing that I've always believed
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.700]   from the time I was very young,
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:54.860]   I was convinced that our inevitable death
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.140]   was gonna come from aliens, right?
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:01.340]   Like some super aggressive, super violent species
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.940]   was gonna come and smoke us all.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.660]   And I'm like, I'm not like that.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.180]   I'm like, but as soon as one person is,
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.940]   then you're forced to have to accept it as reality, right?
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:17.940]   So I like to fight for every single thing.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.460]   I like to try and be more and more aggressive.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.360]   And if someone matches me,
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.140]   that's when I can use my endurance.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.560]   And if they don't, then I have the tactical advantage.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.300]   So that's kind of my balance point.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.820]   - And then, by the way, you also yell at the ref.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.420]   - Yeah. - I mean, the games,
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.540]   there's like levels to this game.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.540]   But the feeling sometimes when people get frustrated
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.500]   is like, okay, this person's cheating.
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.620]   Or like you're trying to get a good grip
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.460]   before it goes.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.160]   And I think some of the frustration
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.700]   in combination with the trash talk
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.580]   is, well, this person is cheating.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.420]   - Right. - But everybody is like
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.860]   kind of trying to cheat, get an edge within the rules.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.780]   - Yeah.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.000]   So I try and just ramp it, ramp it, ramp it.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.740]   But everybody's different.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.840]   I've learned how to play the game
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.300]   based off of the tools that I have physically.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:16.300]   And for me, this works because my genetic makeup
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.420]   is more of a persistence hunter, right?
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.540]   So like I need to extend things.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.940]   And that works well for me.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:28.940]   If I was more explosive,
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.960]   I probably wouldn't have the same strategies, yeah.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.260]   - By the way, for people who are watching,
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.700]   you're wearing a No Limits hoodie,
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.260]   which is one of your nicknames.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.340]   - I don't wash this thing too much.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.940]   It's my bacterial shield to the world, yeah.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.780]   - Awesome, so you mentioned Jodi.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.140]   She's often in your corner
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.780]   and does perhaps more trash talking than even you.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.420]   So I mean, if we could step away,
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.020]   she's an incredible human being.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:04.100]   As sort of as a fan, it's fun to watch the two of you,
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.340]   both when you're arm wrestling and just as people.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.660]   You just see so much, I don't know,
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.860]   kindness and love radiating from the two of you
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.060]   whenever you're trash talking or talking about
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.620]   just random things or just talking about life.
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.020]   It's just a beautiful thing to watch.
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.460]   And thank you for sharing that with the world.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:28.460]   But maybe, can you, she paid me to ask you this,
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:32.220]   but what are the things you love about Jodi,
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.500]   your wife, Jodi Lark?
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.620]   What are the ways she's affected your life?
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:42.660]   - Yeah, Jodi and I go way back, right?
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.260]   We were in high school together.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:51.700]   The thing that I admire most in people is bravery.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:56.780]   To me, it's the most admirable quality.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:02.780]   And Jodi always has inspired me 'cause she's such a fighter.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:07.820]   If she believes that something's true,
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.820]   she does not back down.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.900]   She will not.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:15.060]   And not to say that she can't change her mind
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.700]   'cause she can, but while she is convicted,
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.360]   she'll not stop fighting.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.380]   She's pulled me out of the fire repeatedly.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.580]   We've lived through so many things.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.620]   Very lucky.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.220]   - How has she made you a better arm wrestler?
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.140]   - She's fed me.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:38.300]   - Yeah, I could see your videos of your house
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.500]   basically coming apart when she's not there.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.780]   - Yeah, without Jodi, I'm on the street living in a tent
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.100]   and yeah, eating dog food.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:54.980]   - Bravery.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.020]   What about love?
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.660]   How has love made you stronger?
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.160]   Now we're gonna make Devin uncomfortable.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.220]   - Love is difficult to accept.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:09.260]   Love is one of those things that a lot of times,
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.580]   you don't feel worthy of it.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.900]   And so it's hard sometimes to accept someone's love.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   And someone who really loves you,
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.860]   they'll love you even when you don't.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:25.020]   And here you go, you're gonna make me cry, Lex.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:28.580]   Yeah, Jodi and I have been through so much.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:35.500]   And she's shown me how, she's supported me
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.660]   just repeatedly, repeatedly.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.660]   - Some of that is loyalty and patience and perseverance
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.860]   and all those things.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:46.220]   That's like when love really shows itself.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.060]   - Yeah.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.420]   - It's like sticking through together for years,
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.660]   even when you're through the shitty times.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:57.020]   - Love and faith are powerful forces in this universe.
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:02.020]   Without them, we can descend into darkness very quickly.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.620]   As a world, even between people,
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:09.620]   when love and faith is destroyed, then we fall apart.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.980]   And I've been graced by the love that Jodi's given me.
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:19.820]   It's allowed me to continue to build.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.780]   When you have love between people, then you build together.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:27.780]   I love my family, I love Canada,
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.420]   I love the arm wrestling community.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.580]   I have a love for what we're trying to achieve
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.780]   as a human species.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:38.740]   When that falls apart, we don't have much.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.500]   - Yeah, just with my boy there, yeah.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.340]   - Yeah.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.460]   You also mentioned you were,
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:53.860]   you once had a job where your death was a real possibility.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.980]   So you were in the Canadian Special Forces.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.520]   What did you take away from that experience,
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.260]   that time in your life?
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:05.820]   - Yeah, it was such a great life.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.100]   Really, really loved it.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.620]   Honestly, I never wanted to leave.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.820]   I never thought I would leave.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.660]   I thought I'd be there my whole life.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:18.300]   Real honor to get to serve.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.460]   - What did you get to do?
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:22.440]   What was the things you loved craftsmanship-wise,
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.940]   like fun things you get to do, learn and challenge yourself?
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.780]   And you mentioned sort of honor
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.340]   in terms of the serving part.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.140]   - Yeah.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.940]   My favorite thing about serving in the Special Forces
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.540]   was for sure the people that I worked with.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.740]   That's probably the first thing I could say.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:49.420]   I never, I always felt totally comfortable
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:52.500]   in putting my life in the other guy's hands.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.280]   I was so happy to be in a place where I felt I could follow.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.900]   Didn't matter.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:04.380]   I knew that the people ahead of me were incredible.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.100]   I knew the people beside me were incredible.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.860]   So just having that faith in your team, it's very special.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.620]   And to know that they're there for a reason
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.260]   that has nothing to do with money.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:18.600]   You know, and that's what kind of brings everybody together,
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.540]   is you're there for a higher purpose.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:24.500]   And in terms of being an adrenaline junkie,
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   there's nothing like it.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.700]   I mean, there's nothing like going out at night and fighting.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.940]   And when I say fighting,
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:34.560]   like my whole life I wanted to fight.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.820]   And to me, there's a lot of,
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.420]   and look it, I've said this in the past,
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.840]   and I think it's been a personal failure of mine,
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.580]   because I've said things like,
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.060]   it's the highest level that you can do.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.900]   And I don't believe that to be true anymore.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:54.540]   But at the time, I thought it was the best way
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:58.380]   I could express my drives that I had, you know,
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.260]   to be a fighter.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.740]   - So your sense in the past, and maybe in part now,
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:07.460]   is that fighting is when humans get a chance
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.460]   to express themselves deeply.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:14.460]   Like that mix of the bravery, the integrity,
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:19.260]   whatever that is that makes us human,
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.100]   that human spirit can really shine.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.700]   - And I don't believe that anymore.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:25.900]   I believe that you can do that in any field,
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.220]   in any discipline.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.500]   You know, if you go hard enough,
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.660]   it all kind of starts to feel the same.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:35.820]   But at the time, that expression to me
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.340]   was really, really awesome.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:39.660]   I loved close quarter battle.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.860]   That was my favorite thing.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.020]   That's really the whole reason I was there.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.300]   - Can you describe close quarter battle?
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:50.100]   - Close quarter battle is team fighting.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.580]   So, and it can look a lot of different ways,
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.380]   but basically it's ground troops
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.420]   doing some kind of a mission.
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.180]   And it's the orchestrated movement that is the skill.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:07.340]   The orchestrated movement and the drills
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.140]   done quickly and accurately, it's very difficult.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.700]   - With communication?
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.540]   - With communication.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.260]   - Yeah, so it's basically cooperating together,
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.140]   communicating, there's some strategy,
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.860]   there's some adapting to the changing environment.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.420]   - And the more the team works together,
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.060]   the less communication there is.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.140]   And that's an amazing thing to do,
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.740]   to be part of a machine, well, machine,
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:35.740]   a team of people who can fight together like that.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:39.900]   I think it's, we're really designed to do it.
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.580]   Like, as good as we can fight as individuals,
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.940]   the thing that makes us really good
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:46.820]   is our ability to fight as a team, yeah.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.500]   - Yeah, that's one of the things that makes us really human
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.940]   is that collective intelligence and the social aspect.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.620]   And fighting is the highest of stakes.
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.260]   So that social interaction under the highest of stakes
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:04.260]   is, really does bring out something that's deeply human.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:10.340]   I mean, war in general brings out something deeply human.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.580]   - It does.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.380]   - It's, I mean, obvious to say that it's tragic
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:20.380]   that it results in so much loss of life and well-being.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:25.340]   Let me, if it's okay for a brief moment
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.660]   to take us back to arm wrestling.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.660]   We did this like offline, we talked about,
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.020]   you gave me some advice about arm wrestling.
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.820]   But maybe do a high-level overview
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:40.820]   of like the different styles and strategies
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.420]   that we've talked about.
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.620]   We talked about the importance of strength and power,
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:49.940]   but is there like offensive, defensive styles?
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.740]   Is there, we mentioned King's move.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.780]   What would you classify your style as?
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.300]   It's nice for people that don't know,
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.700]   maybe even zoom back out.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:04.700]   So arm wrestling is a sport where two people have to,
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:09.820]   when we talk about strictly the sport,
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.180]   put their elbow on a particular pad,
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:15.620]   means they have to keep that elbow on that pad.
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:20.620]   And they win when the back of one of their hands
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.740]   crosses some kind of, or basically touches the table.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:28.100]   And when you actually lock up,
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.380]   you do so depending on the organization,
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:36.700]   without straps, meaning there's just you, agree.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.060]   It's like mutual agreement that you're going to
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:43.100]   clasp your hands in a way that's fair.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.540]   And there's a referee that helps ensure that it's fair,
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.900]   but of course there's these little games going on.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:51.300]   And then when you actually go all out with this battle,
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.780]   if there's no straps, you can slip out.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.900]   So often you'll put the straps,
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.060]   which means you're, it's like marriage.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.860]   - Yeah. - You're committed.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.980]   - Yeah.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.260]   - For like somebody will have to lose essentially.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.540]   There's no pulling out.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.500]   So that's sort of the battle.
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.580]   Within that, what are the different styles
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.740]   that you can speak to that people that don't know
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.500]   arm wrestling could understand?
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.260]   - Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.120]   around the subject a bit.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.860]   I'd say there's a lot of different types.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:30.860]   There's specialists, and there's kind of blenders
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.060]   and people who are very versatile.
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:38.300]   A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:43.300]   They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:46.900]   And their style is very kind of focused.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.620]   And you'll see it with a lot of athletes.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:54.140]   Like kind of a talk guy, but guy who's very active,
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.740]   a guy called Jerry Catarat.
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.740]   Okay, as soon as you think Jerry Catarat,
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:58.980]   he's got a very unique style.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.620]   He's got a flop wrist press.
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.940]   Okay, so most of his technique
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.660]   is built around this one system.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.380]   - Flop wrist means you're-- - Yes.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.700]   - What it sounds like. - Yeah.
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.780]   - So your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you're pushing.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.500]   So he is pushing from a losing position.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.060]   - No, he will be offensive.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.380]   So he will be in a press, so offensively,
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.500]   so he'll give his hand away
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.740]   so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.100]   - So he doesn't, wow.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.420]   - Right. - So you can press,
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.660]   press means like push. - Push.
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.260]   - Without having that hook position.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:40.300]   - Right, which is what most people are always looking for.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.820]   And Jerry's looking for it as well.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.740]   And then, so example, there's another one.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.380]   There's another specialist, Matt Mask.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.780]   - Yeah. - He's a top roller, right?
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:51.740]   Basically, that's his great move, is a top roll.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.740]   And his other weapons aren't nearly as powerful.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.820]   Just incredible top roll.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.420]   And then you have a lot of athletes that are more blended.
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.340]   Okay, they have a lot of good options.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:07.140]   I think that I probably fall more into that category.
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.780]   You have people who are more speed guys, okay?
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:15.780]   So they try and do very little, I'd call it attrition.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:21.060]   Right, so a lot of people are very willing to trade energy.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.620]   - Mm-hmm. - Right, 'cause they have faith
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.300]   that their gas tank or their pool
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.260]   eventually will tire the other person out.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:30.300]   So anytime there's a trade, they'll trade.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.540]   Whereas a guy like Travis Bajan,
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:35.820]   he was very, very well known
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:38.580]   as being extremely explosive, right?
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:42.260]   But if the match stops, typically he's gonna lose.
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:48.140]   All right, so based off of your genetics, your hand,
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.580]   there's a lot of ways to skin it.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:55.580]   So I think you said something like you're a 20-second guy.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:00.300]   - That's right, I'm a 20-second guy.
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.220]   - So what are the seconds we're talking about?
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.740]   So a lot of the power people,
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.860]   they wanna win in the first maybe five seconds.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.180]   - Even shorter.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.900]   - Just that first push, that first press.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.740]   - Absolutely. - And that's it.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.660]   - Right to the pad, yeah.
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:17.380]   - And so you're trying to hold off that attack.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.440]   - Yeah, if I beat you in a second,
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.720]   we're not in the same world, yeah.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.540]   When I'm with my peer group,
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.860]   I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:31.780]   That's a typical win for me when I'm with a peer.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:35.740]   Whereas other guys, when they're with their peers,
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.340]   they'll win in a second, right?
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.180]   That's how they do it.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.660]   That's the way they're built, that's the way they train.
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:45.620]   Yeah, most guys at a higher level,
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.020]   it all starts to kind of,
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.380]   it starts to get more and more difficult
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.860]   to be a specialist at the high level now.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.360]   Some people just have little holes in their games.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:20:00.380]   It's rare to get someone who can really do all the moves.
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.460]   It's very rare.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:05.620]   - Where would you put Levon?
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.740]   - I would not say he's a specialist.
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:11.700]   I'd say his top roll is the strongest move.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.540]   - Top roll.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.780]   - Top roll is the strongest move, yeah.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.700]   And the interesting thing about the specialist
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:23.700]   versus the blender, there's a counter, right?
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:27.380]   Every move has a move that theoretically
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.420]   should be the right choice.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.700]   So if you're a single move guy,
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.660]   there's gonna be a guy out there who will get you.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.460]   Yeah, it'll be very difficult for you to beat that guy.
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:43.180]   But when you come to a tournament,
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:47.780]   typically specialists do much better in tournament scenarios
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:50.060]   because their singular move can get them
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.100]   through a tournament very quickly and efficiently.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.300]   Whereas you get a blender in a tournament,
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.860]   they typically will have longer and more difficult matches.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.940]   - It buys you out.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.940]   - Right, yeah.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:05.820]   But in supermatch format, typically blenders do better.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:09.700]   - So we offline also talked about arm sumo
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.500]   or freedom arm wrestling.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.660]   I don't know how you wanna call it.
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.700]   - Oh, I love freedom.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.940]   (laughing)
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:19.180]   - Exactly, North American way.
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:25.420]   So this is this idea, and I watched a few videos,
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:29.020]   and it looks fun, is basically removing the restriction
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.100]   of having to keep your elbow on the pad
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:35.380]   and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:38.020]   I think you've mentioned that the criticism that gets
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.820]   is it might be injury prone or something like that.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.060]   So can you describe this arm sumo,
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.500]   freedom arm wrestling idea?
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.500]   - When you come to freedom arm wrestling,
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.580]   basically it removes the limitation
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.780]   of a standard arm wrestling table.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.420]   So basically every single thing
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.020]   is a freedom arm wrestling table.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.900]   Some are better than others.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:00.660]   So looking for that nice table where we can kind
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:04.420]   of stand apart from each other and we're anatomically
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.980]   in a fairly safe position.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.580]   And the rules in freedom, the way you win is like
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:14.100]   the knuckles must either touch the tabletop
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.980]   or you hold it off the edge for a three count.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.180]   So this is the main way to win.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.020]   Yes, you can foul, like if you lift your elbow up,
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:25.180]   it's still a foul, but you have the entire playing surface.
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:28.100]   So your elbow is no longer limited to your seven by seven
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.580]   or seven by nine pad.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.020]   So you can move it all over the table.
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.060]   You can move your body around the table a bit too.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.340]   - And if it's a big table,
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.260]   your body could largely be on the table.
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.140]   - Yeah, so it basically it's like adjusting your ring size.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:44.700]   So arm wrestling, you're fighting in a phone booth.
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.380]   So you're fighting in a field,
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.940]   you're fighting just bigger.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:50.260]   So it just makes the sport bigger.
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.500]   Yeah, this is Japan.
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.900]   - But even on a small table,
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.420]   even in a slightly larger phone booth,
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.500]   you can get a lot more fun and variety.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.420]   - Way more, I love it.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.820]   I think it makes the sport bigger.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:05.460]   I actually believe that it's the future of the sport.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:06.820]   I really do.
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.100]   - Because it makes it more accessible.
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:09.220]   Like you don't need the equipment,
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.260]   you can do it at a bar, all that kind of stuff.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:14.300]   - Yeah, less equipment requirements.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.980]   Most kids start freedom.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.380]   Like most kids arm wrestle on school desks.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.700]   Yeah, and like if you see a guy on the street,
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.660]   you're like, whatever, like you can arm wrestle anywhere.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.380]   You don't need to bring your table around with you.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.780]   - If we talked about the elite level,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.780]   if somebody was interested in starting in arm wrestling
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:39.820]   or like going from just like, you know,
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.180]   go to the gym, you kind of lift,
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:43.780]   you've arm wrestled a few times,
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.660]   trying to get better at it, trying to learn.
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.940]   How would you advise like getting better
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.380]   to where you can beat your closest buddies?
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.220]   - Yeah. - That first step.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:56.660]   - First step, I'd say find people.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.980]   Find people, find good people.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.500]   - Volume.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:02.340]   - Well, get with a club,
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:03.540]   get with people who know what they're doing,
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.980]   who can mentor you.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:05.820]   - And that's really cool.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.620]   I realized there's a club in Austin.
[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:09.460]   - Yeah. - I'm sure there's
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.180]   in a lot of places. - Oh, they're everywhere.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:14.220]   We got this app called Armbet.
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.020]   - Which is a app that helps you find other people there.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.300]   - Yeah, very easy.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:21.460]   But I mean, they're all over social networks.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:24.500]   I mean, it's kind of widespread now.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.860]   But yeah, find people, find people.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:31.820]   And it's just much easier to learn with another person
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.740]   and you'll get stronger that way.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.380]   But I mean, do the lifts.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.580]   I mean, if you go to the gym, just start doing the lifts.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.940]   And right away, those will technically prepare you.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.420]   - What are the lifts?
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.260]   Can we describe?
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:48.140]   - Yeah, so I'd say if you wanna just keep it
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:50.820]   very, very simple, let's just talk about three.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:52.820]   There's much more than three.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:56.140]   But when you talk about energy allocation,
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.660]   these three lifts, in my opinion,
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:02.900]   should be like 90% of your investment.
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.040]   It's very big, these three lifts.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.580]   And the exact percentages, you can argue about it,
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:14.180]   but we'll start off with the cupping of the wrist.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:16.220]   Just this, it's a simple thing.
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.880]   And do it with a cable.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.980]   You can get a thicker diameter,
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:24.260]   so it kind of is more out on your fingers
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.340]   where an armrest is gonna attack you.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.500]   Because any good armrest is gonna attack your fingers.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.060]   - So like open hand?
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.300]   - No, no.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.880]   Well, I mean, for health, yes, you could.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.980]   But if you wanna be really specific,
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.700]   you train exactly the way you would at a table,
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.980]   in the position that you actually start the match.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.500]   - And then you're just doing this kind of--
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.220]   - Yes, to your center.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:50.340]   One of the big misconceptions in arm wrestling
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:52.780]   is that you're aiming for that pin pad.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:57.020]   - No, the chest up here.
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:58.220]   - Bring it close to you.
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.780]   Make it come close to you.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.060]   You see, whenever I do my exercises,
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:05.280]   the vector is always pulling straight towards me.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.020]   So just cupping close to you.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.500]   The most dangerous thing that a person can do to me
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.420]   on an arm wrestling match is just pull me away from my body.
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.460]   That's a terrible thing for me.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.900]   Yeah, so that cupping,
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.820]   that's a massive part of the sport.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.860]   So now when you think,
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.380]   what does the cup do to the other person?
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:33.100]   If I cup, they get turned over, right?
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.120]   So this has to get really strong.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.720]   This pronation.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.940]   - To fight that rolling.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.260]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:47.260]   So that's through the thumb.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:50.220]   - Yeah, oh, so you put, got it.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.820]   You put on the thumb and you put this motion.
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:53.700]   - Yeah.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:54.540]   - Got it.
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:56.040]   - Yeah, and those two things,
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.340]   those two things together, this cupping and rolling,
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.220]   this is what's gonna make the person's hand bend back.
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.100]   And once a person's hand is bent back,
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.980]   just their whole game gets cut to pieces.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:09.900]   They have very little good options.
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.140]   It's all like nasty stuff.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:13.100]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.020]   So those two things, that's a huge part
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:18.040]   of your investment.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.900]   Rise, always be climbing.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:24.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.740]   Yeah, those three simple things,
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.940]   that's what I would tell anybody to spend
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:32.380]   most of their time on if you wanna become an art wrestler.
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.660]   - So, and to use bands would be good for this.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:38.060]   - Bands are great because they're easy to transport.
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.980]   The only problem I have with bands is like,
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.740]   if you like to measure, you know,
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:43.740]   and if you like to be precise,
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.220]   bands just aren't that precise.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:46.780]   - Right, to have growth.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.780]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.940]   - I mean, it's just like, you know,
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.620]   you know exactly what you need.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.500]   The prescription is kind of, a band is kind of like,
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.660]   and a lot of people, myself included,
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:59.660]   I like to know exactly my outputs.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:01.180]   So weights.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:04.220]   - So it would be like cables?
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.140]   - Yep, cables are nice.
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.100]   Bands are great too.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.700]   I mix the two.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:13.460]   Bands are when I kind of don't need to,
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.780]   they're more like easy for me.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:18.340]   When I train bands, bands are dangerous
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:20.180]   'cause the acceleration is so high on them.
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.980]   Like when you screw up with band training,
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:25.340]   the acceleration is way faster than gravity, right?
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.660]   So if you do something bad,
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.540]   it can make it go really much worse.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:34.540]   - Yeah, it's funny that you didn't mention bicep curls or--
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.700]   - Well, it's a chain.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:37.540]   It's a chain.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.540]   - Right, I mean, the idea, if you focus on these three,
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:41.700]   the other stuff catches up.
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.340]   Like it's all involved.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.020]   This whole thing is involved.
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:50.020]   - So if you have an ax, right, the blade of the ax,
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:54.220]   that's these things, right?
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.420]   Like you need the pointy end of all your attacks
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.500]   to be awesome, right?
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500]   - If you have a super sharp ax,
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.740]   you could have a shitty hand.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.100]   - Exactly, yeah, right?
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:06.540]   - Yeah, so focus on that.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.860]   - The pointy, the tip of the ax.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:11.140]   - Yeah, the tip of the ax is so important, right?
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:15.100]   Like if I have an awesome bicep and I can't quite use it,
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.660]   what's it good for, right?
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:18.580]   - Yeah, I think a lot of the motions
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:19.700]   with the wrist that you mentioned
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:23.620]   are just thinking about jujitsu, especially in the gi.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:27.660]   There's a lot of, I mean, there's so much importance to this
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:32.660]   and people don't often work it explicitly.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.380]   So many of the chokes require ability to,
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.460]   it's almost like exactly like arm wrestling.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.300]   - Very close.
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:42.140]   - Because you're weak here, what's that called, flop wrist,
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:45.420]   and you're strong with the cup, yeah.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.700]   And so just getting the muscle, whatever that's involved,
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.340]   the muscle, the turning, the pressure,
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:54.120]   'cause that's where also the choke comes.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:57.700]   That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:00.300]   is also the thing that finishes the person
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.140]   when you have them grabbed.
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.700]   - The strength is very similar.
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.460]   - Yeah, it's fascinating actually.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:08.300]   Of course, like you said, if you wanna be very good,
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.060]   you should be doing the very specific exact motion.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.620]   - Yeah, so if I was gonna do jujitsu,
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.560]   I'd be like working out with the gi.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.500]   - Yeah, the problem is, you know,
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:23.500]   it's difficult to construct the exact,
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.660]   so you have to actually go with people
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.940]   and then they don't like being choked on, right?
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:31.620]   So like it's hard to, I'm actually a big,
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.780]   we have these kinds of debates all the time,
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:38.420]   is I'm a big believer in drilling.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:40.740]   I love doing something thousands of times.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.140]   Like John Donahue, somebody I mentioned to you
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:45.980]   about the jujitsu folks here,
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.980]   they're less believers in drilling.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:52.260]   They see the value of almost like the mind
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:56.580]   of going live and exploring ideas, it's that play.
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.920]   You don't need to do the thing a thousand times.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.660]   You just need to always be thinking
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:05.220]   about the little details that make you better.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:09.380]   And then in action practicing, like developing the strength,
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:12.360]   the power, the explosive of the agility in action.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.060]   So actually rolling.
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.860]   I don't, you know, I agree with this,
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:20.100]   but I just believe in volume more.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.180]   - Yeah, so you can accomplish it through volume.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.780]   You can play a lot.
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.700]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:28.420]   Well, that's the, if you really wanna get good,
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:30.740]   is you're talking about, I mean,
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:33.300]   that's why a lot of these folks
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.380]   are training three times a day.
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.980]   They're doing, you know, they're putting in the hours,
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:40.060]   eight hours, nine hours, just--
[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.860]   - Whoa, that's tough, oh my God.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:44.020]   - Well, so there are a lot of them are not going hard.
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.380]   It's just being on the mat.
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:47.980]   Some of it is just sitting there talking through ideas,
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:50.740]   watching others or teaching, explaining stuff.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.780]   It's just, it's like, it's not just physical.
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:56.840]   It's mental too, 'cause you're keeping in your mind.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.660]   And some of the greatest, this is what they talk about,
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:03.820]   the wrestlers I've talked with, the fighters,
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.940]   at the top of their career, they basically,
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:11.900]   George St. Pierre is like this, another fellow Canadian,
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:16.900]   is like, has stick figures in his head that he can't help.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:20.580]   They're like in there, 'cause if you train enough hours,
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.420]   it's just gonna be in your head
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.780]   and they're all going to be playing around in your head.
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.840]   And some little detail over time,
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.740]   it's almost like computing or something like that.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.520]   And that ends up having a result,
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.720]   even though you're not physically doing anything.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.660]   It's always in there.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:41.280]   I do have to return to diet real quick.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.840]   I know we're talking about pancakes.
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.840]   Let me, quite seriously, you are one of the,
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:54.120]   I mean, strongest athletes in the world for your sport.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.360]   So you have to get big, you have to get powerful,
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.740]   you have to get strong.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:02.080]   What is the right diet for you for that?
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.380]   Like, what do you eat?
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:06.960]   How often do you eat?
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.340]   Yeah, from the highest detail to the smallest,
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.800]   or the things that make you happy and feel good.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:17.800]   - Yeah, I've experimented with every diet.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.040]   I've done it all.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.920]   I've been a vegan.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.080]   I've done raw.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.020]   I've eaten only meat.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:26.240]   I've eaten balanced.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.580]   I've eaten like a bodybuilder.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:32.520]   You name it, I've probably tried it.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:38.740]   I don't believe that it's as important
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.360]   in the sport of arm wrestling
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.560]   as it is perhaps in other sports.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:47.400]   I believe that, I mean, just to be very basic,
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.160]   I mean, if you're eating enough food,
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.680]   you're probably gonna be okay.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.560]   - So it's just calories?
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.680]   - It's a lot, I mean, really, I mean,
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.000]   not to overcomplicate it,
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.040]   but I mean, that's where the conversation starts.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.400]   Are you eating enough food?
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.520]   And it can come in any number of ways.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:08.360]   And I don't think it's as important
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.080]   as a lot of other people do.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.600]   I'm certainly irresponsible in a lot,
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.360]   but the thing is, back to like volume, right?
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.640]   Like you need to, like if you wanna be a super heavyweight,
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.680]   it's very different
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.040]   than if you wanna be a weight category guy.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.720]   If you wanna be a weight category guy,
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:30.200]   I'd say that you need to be more responsible,
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.040]   make better choices.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.080]   If you wanna be a super heavyweight, everything.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.340]   - Just so we're watching a delicious looking omelet.
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:42.160]   So eggs, bacon, syrup, so you don't care carbs.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.640]   So in all the things you've tried,
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.460]   so I mostly eat meat now.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:48.000]   And I landed on that.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.720]   There's several things, obviously I'm not,
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.520]   but I do a lot of sport.
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.640]   And I was very surprised how my particular,
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.640]   very specific body can perform better with only meat.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:01.480]   Why better?
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.280]   The sports I do, the mind matters.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.160]   And so for some reason, my mind is just clear.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:09.040]   And I don't think, 'cause it feels unhealthy.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.840]   It just makes me feel really good.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.760]   I don't think I would recommend it to anybody else.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:18.760]   So it's interesting that that journey of just exploring
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:22.980]   can take you to figure out something about your own self.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.000]   - One of the most interesting things
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.340]   that I heard about nutrition was,
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:29.180]   I heard there was--
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:31.220]   - You actually put Doritos on, I forgot about that.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm an idiot.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:38.100]   Now I'd say over the last couple years,
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.780]   I've really gone into carbs a lot,
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:42.060]   and high glycemic carbs.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.880]   Just to, I feel like it's one of the best things you can do
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.000]   if you're working out really hard.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.840]   Just add carbs. - Cheers.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:48.680]   - Exactly.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:55.200]   But, oh, where was I?
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.960]   - So you've added-- (laughs)
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.120]   - Distracted. - The syrup is--
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:58.960]   - I forget everything. - So delicious,
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:35:59.980]   it's distracting.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:03.560]   No, so you've added the high glycemic carbs into the mix.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:06.600]   So that, those help, but that's for mass building.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:10.120]   - Right, so there was a study that I heard about
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.940]   by somebody who's trying to identify heart attacks.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.960]   They did this great big study, and at the end of it,
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.900]   I mean, didn't matter what the people ate,
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:21.620]   the most important thing was how they felt
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.700]   about the food that they were eating.
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:27.580]   Yeah, so if you believe in the food,
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:30.660]   if you believe that it's gonna do good things for you,
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.780]   and if you allocate it the right way,
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:35.420]   it's gonna have a positive impact.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:37.620]   And I try and do that, no matter what it is.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:40.140]   I have my foods that I think do certain things,
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:45.140]   and so, for me, I know that, actually, I mean,
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:49.920]   I learned about corn-fed pumps when I was overseas.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.600]   I realized that if I, I never used to eat crap,
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.700]   really didn't, I ate super clean all the time.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:03.580]   And when I was faced with imminent death more,
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.920]   I would be like, okay, I'm going out tonight,
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:10.600]   let's have a couple ice cream bars.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.080]   You know, like, whatever.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.080]   And what I realized is if I eat an entire bag of chips,
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:21.720]   or a bunch of chocolate bars,
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:25.000]   and then I go and have a workout,
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.440]   my workout will be incredible.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.660]   It'll be incredible.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:35.240]   There's something about easily processed carbohydrates
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:40.240]   that will continue to quickly get into your blood
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.840]   as fast as you can burn it.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:46.020]   And there's something about that that,
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:50.580]   well, it gives you incredible blood flow, yeah.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.040]   - And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that.
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:54.920]   - Right.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.380]   - And then believing it works,
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:58.600]   and that's how it makes it work better.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.440]   - Exactly.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.160]   I mean, I feel that way.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.280]   I think this is really not,
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.780]   this has been frustrating to me about the health culture
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:09.900]   in the United States, in the studies that are done.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.120]   You know, you look at like the importance of sleep,
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.080]   the importance of X diet, all those kinds of things.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.380]   I wish incorporated into that would be
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.460]   your mental relationship with all these things.
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:23.880]   So for example, people that tell me,
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.520]   "Well, your sleep schedule is insane."
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.280]   Yes, perhaps, but also it's insane
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.680]   because I'm doing what I love
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.360]   and I don't see it as a problem.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.200]   - Right.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.840]   - And I think that's really important to understand.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:43.200]   If you're, if you sleeping crazy hours
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.000]   is not affecting your stress
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.960]   and is actually making you happy
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.920]   or you're drawing some kind of source of happiness
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.120]   and pleasure and satisfaction,
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.900]   like being awake when others aren't.
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.560]   It's like the Mike Tyson thing or something,
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.200]   like training when you've convinced yourself
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.680]   everybody's sleeping and therefore
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.920]   you're somehow training much better.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.760]   - Right.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:07.780]   - That's powerful even if you look statistically
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:10.120]   six hours may be worse than eight hours
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.360]   or four hours may be worse than six hours.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.480]   So the mind is a powerful thing.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.240]   - Super powerful.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:18.520]   But if you wanna be a super heavyweight, eat.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.860]   You gotta eat like stupid amounts all the time.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:25.360]   - Yeah, you have to test your digestive system.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.560]   - What's your favorite meal, by the way?
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.800]   Just if you had to, you know, it's your last meal.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:34.800]   - I am, I do, oh geez, I like so much food, it's tough.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.720]   But I'd say the food that I rely on a lot
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:41.040]   when I'm getting ready to compete is sushi.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.840]   Just because it normally comes in an all you can eat format.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:44.680]   (laughing)
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.520]   You know, so, you know, I love to go and just binge
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.720]   all you can eat, all you can eat buffets.
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:52.440]   Sushi is just super convenient.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.760]   - Yeah.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.200]   - If I was a sushi all you can eat buffet place,
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.800]   I'd be terrified when I saw you.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.080]   Have you had barbecue at Texas?
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.640]   - Yeah, I love it, I love it, yeah.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.060]   - So you, just a small tangent on this,
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:09.760]   you faced the mountain, how for,
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.520]   be honest, well first of all, you arm wrestled them.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:15.360]   It's interesting to ask, so this is the mountain
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.580]   from the Game of Thrones, strong man,
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:20.000]   one of the strongest people in the world,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000]   for a time, the strongest person in the world.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.560]   What was it like, I know sort of,
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.520]   you guys maybe weren't going 1000%, but what's it like?
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.840]   - Well he probably wasn't going 1000%.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.680]   (laughing)
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.960]   - Yeah, but like what, it's interesting to think,
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.840]   what does that strength feel like?
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:41.120]   So it's a specialized strength in another sport.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:41.960]   - Yeah.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.880]   - What did it feel like?
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.120]   What, how strong was he?
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:48.600]   What are some kind of deep insights
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.660]   you've drawn from that battle?
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:55.400]   - I feel like if we were to go back 1000 years,
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:00.400]   and if you give him armor and a two-handed sword,
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.960]   he will just rip across the landscape.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.920]   (laughing)
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.520]   And no one will stop him.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.100]   - So this is the boxing match you came to,
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.820]   but there's also a video of them arm wrestling.
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:14.800]   - Yeah, what a titan though, what a titan.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.840]   You know, a guy like that, tall,
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:21.420]   strong, fit, disciplined.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.180]   I mean, he is quite a warrior.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.980]   - 419 pounds.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:29.820]   - Yeah, yeah, he's incredibly impressive.
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:34.220]   I really like Hap Thor, and I like Eddie Hall too.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:38.580]   And I was just so, I'm just so caught up with the drama.
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:42.860]   Okay, so Eddie Hall and Hap Thor Bjornsson,
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:46.460]   two of the strongest, legendary strongmen that we have.
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.680]   And they were the coolest,
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.540]   they were the top when strongman was really super cool.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.680]   I don't know all the details,
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:58.480]   but they legit hit each other.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.380]   (laughing)
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.560]   Like legit.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.920]   So I think it kind of stems, I don't know,
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.520]   like I say, I'm not right there with them,
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.520]   but Eddie won the World's Strongest Man event
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.240]   or something one year.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.400]   And the thing is, it was one of those victories
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.080]   where Hap Thor was not accepting of his defeat.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.000]   Okay, and there was a little bit of back and forth.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.120]   Basically, from what I understand,
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.060]   they were gonna fight like the knight
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:27.220]   of the World's Strongest Man.
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.180]   And they got kind of got pulled apart.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:33.460]   And this heat between them got translated
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:35.660]   into a potential boxing match.
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.140]   So it's very real.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.280]   It's a very real fight.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.540]   So you have the two strongest dudes on the planet
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.460]   are gonna fight each other.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:47.000]   So I've been like, 'cause arm wrestling and strongman,
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.640]   it's kind of similar communities.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.600]   - Who do you got?
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.920]   If you were giving me financial advice--
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:55.360]   - Oh, Jesus.
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.560]   I am so bad.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.760]   I always call it wrong.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.520]   They're very different.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:03.440]   I see Hap Thor as being--
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.840]   - More Eddie Hall slimming down?
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.320]   Is that what you mean as well?
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.820]   - I see Hap Thor as a bit more regimented,
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.740]   but I see Eddie Hall as like way more barbaric.
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:17.700]   And like, I think he's a little bit more athletic,
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.460]   but Hap Thor is bigger.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:22.460]   And, you know, they've chosen slightly different
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.300]   paths to prepare for the match.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:27.340]   But what happened was like, they were about to fight
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.060]   and Eddie Hall blew his bicep.
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:34.300]   So me, I was getting ready for LaVon in December.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.260]   We were supposed to arm wrestle in December,
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:38.640]   but he's got his movie.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.680]   And so I was like, okay, I can kind of get away
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:43.640]   from the sport just a little bit, broaden my base.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:47.160]   That happened and I was like, oh, an opportunity.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:48.000]   - You stepped in.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.400]   - An opportunity to fight.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.920]   I'm like, I'll do it.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:51.760]   - How much training?
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.100]   You trained a little bit.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.740]   So can you tell about your own decision to do that?
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.700]   What was the training like?
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:58.540]   What was the experience like?
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:00.000]   - Yeah, oh, it was so much fun.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.660]   It was so much fun.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:05.580]   So basically I made a funny video
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:08.700]   and I sent it to the organizers of Core Sports
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.720]   that I would do it.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.560]   I'm like, I'll do it.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.840]   I'm sure they got a thousand people who wanted to do it.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.920]   But I'm like, listen, I'm an old man.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.960]   Like I'm gimped up like everywhere
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.540]   outside the arm wrestling lanes.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:25.160]   I said, but I will 100%, like if you let me fight him,
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.660]   I'll give it my all.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.560]   And whatever, they didn't get back to me.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:30.640]   They're like, yeah, whatever, okay.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.540]   So then they call me on a Friday,
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:37.040]   like five weeks before the event.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.000]   And they're like, hey, Davin, were you serious?
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.260]   And I'm like, oh shit.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:43.840]   (laughing)
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.480]   And I'm like, yes, I was serious.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.580]   Yeah, I'll do it.
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:48.720]   And they're like, okay.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.400]   They're like, it's down to you and like two other people.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.280]   We'll get back to you in a day or two.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.480]   But you would do it.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.300]   And I'm like, okay.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:44:59.800]   So they got back to me on Sunday.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.200]   So right away I'm like skipping rope
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.560]   and I'm like, I only arm wrestle legs.
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.640]   That's all I do.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.560]   - So what was your, you did some striking training.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.480]   - Yeah, so I went to this guy that,
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:17.420]   he was awesome, Zach Ben Bushida there.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.560]   That was it, from TriStar.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.120]   Do you know Firas Tahabi?
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.960]   - And yes, people in the comments,
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:26.680]   I will interview him on this podcast.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.320]   - He's brilliant, right?
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:29.720]   He's an incredible guy.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.440]   So right away, like I had no idea
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:33.880]   about the fight community across Canada really.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:37.920]   And I got like, by the fifth message that said,
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.360]   you must train with Firas.
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.240]   I was like, okay, called him up.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.480]   He was incredible right away.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.120]   He's like, yeah, you can come and we'll just work with you.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.540]   So I got the call.
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:52.040]   I called him on like Monday at two o'clock.
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.800]   By like seven o'clock, I had my things packed
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:58.520]   and I went to Montreal and I spent four weeks
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.160]   in the fighter dorms.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.280]   - Just humbling yourself.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:04.840]   - Yeah, every day, just getting punched in the face,
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:10.320]   over and over, going for runs with all,
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.120]   like they're all like Olympians and pro fighters
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.000]   living in the dorms, super cool dudes.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.240]   They were so good to me.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:19.240]   - Yeah, there's a good video of you and Firas just talking.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.640]   Yeah, I don't remember which stage this was,
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.200]   but basically-- - This is early.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.480]   - But you were already beginning to get humbled.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:28.720]   - Oh man, I knew, I mean, I knew what I was getting into.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.040]   Like I knew it was gonna be a losing battle,
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:35.360]   but I felt like the opportunity to fight Thor,
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.160]   like how cool is that?
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:40.400]   Like I had to say, I had to do it.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:46.560]   I love the process and I learned a lot from doing it.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.240]   Like the dorms, I wanna do something like that
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.080]   with arm wrestling.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.120]   I think we're big enough now that we can have these kind of
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.680]   dorms, frat houses, whatever you wanna call it.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.860]   - What's the dorm like?
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:00.720]   So you're basically staying there, food is there.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.760]   So you mentioned, what was the word you used,
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:04.600]   administration?
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.240]   - Yeah, exactly, that's it.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.440]   - So it removes all of that.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.480]   - Makes it so simple.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.320]   - You can just focus.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:12.000]   - You know, the gym is here, you live here.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.260]   That your life becomes simple.
[01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:19.000]   - So there's a guy named Jimmy Pedro here in America.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.720]   He's a famous coach, there's a place up in Boston.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.760]   He has kind of a dorm like that too.
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:28.740]   That becomes essential when the community is small
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:31.300]   but you're trying to do epic things
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:33.140]   like win an Olympic gold.
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.940]   So you have to really put the people together
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.780]   in these kind of minimalist conditions
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.740]   when they just focus on the training, focus, focus, focus.
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:43.820]   - Yeah, it wasn't enough time.
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:46.760]   I mean, I trained for about three or four weeks.
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.500]   But I love the journey.
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:52.060]   - What are some of the fun things you enjoyed?
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:53.180]   So you did mostly striking.
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:55.060]   Did you, yeah, I guess it was--
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:55.900]   - Yeah, it was boxing.
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:57.980]   - It was straight up boxing.
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.900]   What are some things that were transferable?
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.300]   What are some cool things you learned from that?
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:05.220]   So from the world of armor, have you taken anything back?
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:09.020]   Like some training regimens, ideas about training,
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.240]   even just movements?
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:17.420]   'Cause for us it's a unique mind as well for training.
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:19.580]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:23.860]   I mean, I've gone very far down the path of arm wrestling.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:27.860]   Boxing and arm wrestling are very different.
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:30.080]   They're very different sports.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.500]   The physicality required is very different.
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:39.060]   The mentality, I mean, it's fighting.
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.180]   So it's another form of fighting, which is cool.
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:44.420]   The big things that I took back from it,
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:47.940]   the things that I loved about it was I had to run again.
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.220]   - So really work on endurance.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.540]   - Yeah, yeah, I was going for runs with guys in the dorms
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:57.940]   and they would just destroy me.
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:00.940]   Just like, it was so bad.
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:06.340]   - Did you, like how did you feel in the actual boxing
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:08.420]   in terms of endurance?
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.260]   Were you able to--
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:11.220]   - No, no.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.060]   - It's just torture.
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:13.540]   - It was terrible.
[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:16.340]   And the thing is, is it was so crazy for me
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:19.700]   because I really was good once upon a time.
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.260]   I really was, like physically,
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:24.500]   like I had incredible full body endurance,
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:30.740]   but being so specialized, I realized how much I had slipped.
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:34.380]   And yeah, it was fun to try and regain.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:37.060]   I think it's affected my body composition.
[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:39.820]   I think since that training, I've become much more lean.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:43.300]   I think it was a very healthy thing for me to do,
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.780]   like health-wise.
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:47.620]   I always think that when you're far away from competition,
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:50.340]   it's really good to kind of spread out, really good.
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:51.900]   So I think that in that way--
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:52.940]   - Also for your mind too.
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:53.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:56.860]   - Just like, yeah.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:59.520]   Yeah, so something about clearing your,
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:02.100]   I think you've talked about this,
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:06.300]   it's like you're basically taking steps back
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.580]   before you take steps forward.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:09.020]   It's, I forget how you call it.
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:09.860]   - Yeah, the wave.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.700]   - Yeah.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:13.180]   - Yeah, under, you have to go under.
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.620]   You got to.
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.260]   If you want to go above the line,
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:18.540]   you have to spend some time beneath it.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.260]   And yeah, I was definitely beneath the line
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.100]   for a long time.
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:22.620]   (laughing)
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:26.900]   But Mountain, I mean, the interesting thing was
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.140]   as incredible as he is,
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:32.940]   what a monster.
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:37.620]   And I think if you had had him training in boxing
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:40.220]   for a long time and from his youth,
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.980]   I think the guy could be world champion.
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:46.500]   But to be so specialized and then to switch,
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.260]   you're at a disadvantage.
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:52.940]   And also, I know from just fighting guys
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:55.540]   in the gym in TriStar,
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:57.860]   some of those guys were way scarier.
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:58.700]   For real.
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.460]   Like as scary as Thor is,
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:03.700]   there's guys in that TriStar gym
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:05.820]   that don't look like anything,
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:09.340]   that would murder me, much worse.
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:10.340]   Much worse.
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:12.660]   - Yeah, but also, that's the difference
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.060]   between being in the gym and under the lights too.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.180]   I mean, GSB is an example,
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:18.360]   George St. Pierre is an example,
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:21.780]   somebody that maybe doesn't look terrifying.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:22.620]   - He's at a TriStar.
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.380]   - Yep, he trains at TriStar,
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:29.200]   but he's super nice, super humble,
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.260]   but is terrifying when he's fighting.
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:32.100]   - Right.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.580]   - Is dominating people.
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:36.460]   You mentioned death.
[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:37.300]   - Yeah.
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.700]   - And your Canadian special forces,
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:42.260]   and in general, thinking about mortality.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.100]   - Yeah.
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:44.380]   - Do you think about your death?
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:48.260]   Do you contemplate the end,
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:50.620]   that this thing, that this ride ends?
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:52.020]   - All the time, yeah.
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.420]   From, I've thought about death from a young age.
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:56.780]   - Are you afraid of it?
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:58.060]   - Yeah, I hate it.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:59.380]   Yeah, I don't wanna die.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:01.420]   Yeah, definitely don't wanna die,
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:06.120]   but there's times when I can rid myself of it, yeah.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:10.540]   But for sure, I mean, I'm not happy
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:13.540]   that death is inevitable,
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:16.300]   and I'm not happy that potentially
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.100]   it's inevitable for all of us.
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:24.260]   But it does, I like to fight against it.
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:26.220]   - Does it?
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.060]   - Yeah, death is--
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:28.980]   - If you could be immortal, would you choose to?
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:30.760]   - That's my only wish.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.780]   - Oh, see, but here's the thing.
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:35.220]   But the point is to have that wish.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:40.220]   It's like the all-you-can-eat buffet at sushi.
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:44.020]   It's that sushi's more delicious if you have a limit.
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.940]   - Do you have a, oh, well.
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:47.260]   - I don't know.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:48.100]   (laughing)
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:49.540]   - I mean, I don't think I get sick of stuff.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:50.860]   I'm very simple.
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:52.540]   Yeah, I don't think I would get tired of it.
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:53.980]   I really don't.
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:56.220]   I mean, if someone would pose it to you,
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:59.340]   do you wanna live forever, you would choose no?
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.440]   - Yeah, I would choose no.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.280]   - Choose no.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.280]   - Well, my answer's probably yes.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:09.460]   Like, no, I would, it's more like the snooze button.
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:10.620]   - Do you wanna?
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:12.460]   - Well, you could go to sleep.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:16.020]   - But it's very difficult in the moment to go to sleep.
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:20.200]   But if I'm allowed to live forever,
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:26.140]   I'm going to delay all the crazy,
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:29.960]   like all the ambitious goals, all the,
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.540]   because there's always time.
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:33.340]   - That's fine, but there is tomorrow then.
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.200]   - But there is tomorrow.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:37.740]   But see, I think that takes away from the richness of,
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:41.380]   like the richness of the lived experience
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:42.700]   of just each moment.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:46.140]   I think the richness of each moment comes from saying,
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:48.380]   like, I could die tonight.
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.860]   Like, it tastes delicious because you're going to die.
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:55.820]   I'm afraid if you're not, I'm afraid all of that goes away.
[01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:58.860]   All of that magic goes away if you can live forever.
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:53:59.700]   I don't know.
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:00.940]   (laughing)
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:05.180]   But I'll tell you, every time I have a near-death experience
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:06.220]   or think I'm gonna die,
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.300]   I definitely live better afterwards.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:14.140]   Like, it's always been that way, but yeah, no.
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:15.820]   - That's why the Stoics, you know,
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:19.180]   they really preach contemplating your mortality often.
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:21.580]   It kind of reminds you,
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:23.580]   this whole thing could just end any moment
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:25.860]   and it makes you really appreciate.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:27.820]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.980]   I don't know.
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:33.980]   Certainly improving the quality of life is important,
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:39.300]   but part of me thinks that immortality
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:43.500]   is not as fun as we would like to imagine.
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.780]   - Do you think that maybe you're,
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:50.100]   in what you're building, potentially is immortal?
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:54.600]   - Well, that's what I definitely think about with robots.
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:55:00.020]   If they were to have a human-like experience
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.660]   and be able to interact with humans
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:03.420]   in a deep, meaningful way,
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.540]   I think they too have to be mortal
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:08.380]   in some fundamental way that means mortal.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.940]   Like, their ride has to end as well
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:15.260]   because they won't be able to interact with humans deeply
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:16.980]   unless that's the case.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:23.340]   Like, to have fear, to have love,
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:28.680]   the ability to suffer, the ability to miss somebody,
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:32.780]   I think scarcity is important.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:36.620]   You have to be able to truly lose somebody.
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.420]   You have to be, to fear things,
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:43.140]   you have to truly have the risk of destroying yourself.
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:46.400]   And to have a sense of what it means to be a self,
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.060]   you have to be able to lose it.
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.900]   So if you're immortal, you're just going to be,
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:57.980]   I feel like you're going to be like a toaster,
[01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:00.740]   an intelligent toaster that just serves.
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.140]   - Such a negative perspective on it.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:04.060]   - On immortality?
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:06.780]   - Yeah, just think, well, now you can get
[01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:08.500]   all those things done that you want to do.
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.700]   - I hope you're right, I hope you're right.
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:14.260]   - Yeah, I mean, potentially, you could invest even harder
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:16.060]   because you're like, wow, I'm actually gonna be able
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.500]   to get all this stuff done.
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.460]   - I think about this a lot.
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:24.460]   I hope you're right, but I fear that the drive to create,
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:29.580]   I can even do more, all of that disappears
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:31.420]   if you have all the time in the world.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.500]   I just know how lazy I am.
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:35.260]   And if I have all the time in the world,
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:39.180]   I'm just gonna sit there and just watch
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:43.380]   the stupidest YouTube videos for the rest of all eternity.
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:46.320]   - Now, eternity's a long time.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.400]   - Eat Doritos and Cheetos and just get fatter and fatter.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.660]   I can get in shape later, there's always time.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:56.140]   - That's like a long period of contemplation.
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:57.740]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.540]   So for the first thousand years,
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:02.540]   it'll be the Dorito period of the Lex life.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:06.620]   - Yeah, you could be like Jabba the Hutt for a thousand years.
[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:09.140]   - You mentioned aliens, very important topic.
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:11.260]   Do you actually think about this?
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:13.900]   There's been an increased interest,
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:18.380]   there's been increased UFO sightings and encounters,
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:20.500]   all that kind of stuff, the US government
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:25.500]   at least releasing data, releasing videos of pilots,
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:30.220]   pilot observations and from airplanes of UFOs.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.900]   Do you think about this kind of stuff?
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:33.940]   'Cause you mentioned in the following context,
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:37.660]   you mentioned like us humans will get our shit together
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.400]   when the aliens eventually come.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.900]   What do you make of all the sightings?
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:45.780]   Is that something you think about?
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:48.900]   - I thought about it a lot when I was younger.
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.180]   And I've just, I made my conclusions and yeah,
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:54.180]   I don't think that there's a possibility
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.440]   that there aren't aliens.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.180]   I would think it would be impossible
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:58.580]   for there not to be aliens.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:03.900]   I feel like this is pretty good real estate.
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:08.900]   So, you probably want it, but we already might be,
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:10.180]   well, I don't even think might.
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:11.700]   I mean, it's probably quite likely
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:13.660]   that we are to some degree aliens.
[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:16.940]   I mean, all life is probably to some degree alien.
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:18.960]   - I like the real estate, so the resources,
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.860]   but we're also kind of interesting.
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:21.700]   - Yeah.
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:24.240]   - Whatever this ant colony of living organisms
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:27.180]   that we've created, it's kind of interesting to study.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:29.580]   I tend to believe that the alien civilizations
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:33.700]   that are going to reach us or have reached us
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:35.240]   are far more intelligent,
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:39.220]   just orders of magnitude more intelligent than us.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.700]   And so it's going to be very difficult,
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:43.140]   both ways actually, for us to understand them
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:46.340]   and for them to dumb themselves down enough
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:47.540]   to understand us.
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:48.380]   - Yeah, probably.
[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:52.980]   - So, they might even just miss our existence altogether
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:57.040]   just 'cause I tend to believe, I don't know what you think,
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:59.320]   that we're not that special
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:02.800]   in terms of all the life forms in the universe.
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:04.560]   There's a lot of cool stuff out there.
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.880]   - Has to be, has to be.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.520]   - But to us, we're special.
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:10.480]   - Yeah, well, that's all that matters, right?
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.360]   - Yeah.
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:14.680]   Even the human species is the most special to us humans.
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:18.360]   There could be much more special species here on Earth
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.160]   that we're just totally oblivious to,
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:23.120]   like trees on a scale of thousands of years.
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.600]   Maybe they're onto something.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:31.660]   - Lex, you know, I think that so much
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:36.580]   of what makes a person special is what they pass on,
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:39.760]   your kids, but I think that you are quite special
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.420]   because you're part of this thing
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:45.720]   that's potentially giving birth to the next thing.
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:48.580]   - The robots.
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:49.400]   - The robots.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:50.960]   - I should say, the funny thing is,
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:53.860]   while talking to Devin, during this podcast,
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:57.600]   I wear the doorbell ring, had to go downstairs,
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.540]   and there was a big box, (laughs)
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:04.420]   medicine box with a new-legged robot.
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:07.580]   So the hilarity of you saying that is,
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:11.100]   'cause that robot is actually going to likely be
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:14.300]   the main robot that I show to the world
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:17.580]   in the coming months, 'cause that has the,
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.980]   that's the highest compute level in that robot.
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:22.720]   So I've been playing a lot with legged robots,
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.620]   the four legs, like a dog.
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:32.100]   I like all robots, but there's something about
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:34.920]   when a robot has legs, it's able to communicate,
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:38.320]   it's able to connect with humans in some kind of deep way,
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.900]   in the way a dog can, just show affection.
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:43.740]   Something about step, step, step, step,
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:46.220]   and then the robot realizes you're here,
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:48.500]   and then it steps and then notices you
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:51.340]   in the way the dog does and raises its head.
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:56.500]   It makes me feel noticed and heard
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:59.740]   in the same way I do when a dog notices me.
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:02.500]   That excitement, that stupid excitement of like,
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:05.700]   yes, fellow living organism.
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:09.340]   And what excites me about legged robots
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:13.260]   is that holy shit, it's possible to engineer this.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.460]   It's possible to create that feeling.
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:17.220]   And I wonder where that can go.
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:20.280]   There's a lot of negative possible trajectories,
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:23.020]   but I have a sense that there's positive ones too.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:25.500]   - You think that they'll take us with them?
[02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:29.940]   - Yeah, I think so, because I,
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:33.120]   so there's this fear of robots
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:34.880]   that they become super intelligent
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.200]   and run away from us humans,
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.840]   and basically become so intelligent,
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:42.300]   and then they almost, just not giving a damn,
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:43.400]   will destroy us.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:48.180]   But I think in order for robots to become intelligent,
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:51.300]   they have to integrate themselves with society.
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:56.300]   So they, by the very nature of how they become intelligent,
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:58.940]   have to bring us along.
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.620]   So it's not that there'll be this separate thing.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:05.900]   They have to, like we'll have robots in the home,
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:07.440]   where they'll be interacting with us.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.700]   You have human kids, and you have a bunch of robots,
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:12.940]   you have robot friends, you have human friends.
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:16.340]   And the robots make your human to human relationships
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:18.160]   much more meaningful and richer.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.980]   They bring more love to the world, but it's integrated.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:24.460]   It's not like they'll be developing smarter and smarter
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:30.420]   as sentient beings by themselves.
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:32.420]   I think that's very difficult to do.
[02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:34.500]   You have to be doing that together with humans,
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:35.880]   and so we'll come for the ride.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.680]   There's technical things,
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.500]   like we might merge like cyborgs more and more.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.400]   - Well, we already saw our cyborgs, right?
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:46.420]   - With the phones and so on, but more and more.
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:50.860]   So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of robots
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:55.380]   and AI into, increasing the bandwidth
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:56.940]   at which they can communicate.
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.700]   So if we do implants in the brain,
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:04.580]   I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:07.620]   about this as am I, but I think there's a lot
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:09.620]   of trajectories that are positive there.
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:11.700]   That to me is exciting.
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:13.580]   And also, I just don't think it's possible
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:18.060]   to stop this development, so we should steer it.
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:20.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:20.900]   - For good.
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:22.460]   - Did you, I mean, you must've watched
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.660]   the movie "Terminator," right?
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:25.220]   - Yeah, of course, I love "Terminator."
[02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:26.060]   - Yeah.
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:26.880]   - I love Schwarzenegger.
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:28.720]   - My favorite movie of all time.
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:30.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:32.180]   I mean, that's the big fear, right?
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:37.060]   - Yeah, what's the conclusion with "Terminator?"
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:39.260]   Isn't ultimately humanity wins?
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:41.220]   - I think they're at like "Terminator 8" now.
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:42.060]   - Yeah.
[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:43.180]   - You know, I don't know.
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:48.300]   - Yeah, so it's interesting, actually,
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:50.200]   I was gonna bring this up as you were talking about it,
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:53.820]   but China and the United States,
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:56.340]   I actually don't know where Canada is on this,
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:04:00.160]   but they both have agreed that they're not going
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:04.540]   to put limits on autonomous weapon system development.
[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:05.380]   - They're not going to.
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:06.620]   - They're not going to.
[02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:08.500]   So because China said we're not going to,
[02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:12.820]   and now US officially announced that we're not, we can't.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:14.020]   - Well, you can't.
[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:16.940]   It's like, you never could, right?
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:20.780]   As soon as it exists and it's better, people will use it.
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:25.780]   - Well, but there's been a global ban on bioweapons.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:28.860]   So you were able to come to an agreement there
[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:32.340]   that we're not going to use biological weapons in war.
[02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:34.980]   So a lot of people are really upset
[02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:39.540]   that in the case of AI-driven weapons,
[02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:42.300]   the world said, nope, that's okay.
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.140]   And so now you have this potential
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:48.100]   for greater and greater automation in drones,
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:51.380]   for example, in picking bombing locations,
[02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:54.540]   and so the area at which they attack.
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:57.580]   And so you get some of that stuff that you mentioned
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:02.500]   that drew you to the military
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.700]   is that teamwork between humans,
[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:05.860]   that decision-making.
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:10.220]   So there's strategy, but built into that team
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:12.460]   is a deep humanity.
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:16.140]   Even when there's an enemy,
[02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:18.980]   there's lines that you are aware of,
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:20.780]   of what is ethical and what is not,
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:23.060]   what is just and what is not.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:28.060]   And it's so easy for a machine to miss all of that,
[02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:33.260]   plow through it and do deeply inhumane acts,
[02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:34.820]   commit atrocities.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:38.780]   That's something that worries a lot of people.
[02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:45.780]   'Cause, yeah, an AI-based war is just, it's terrifying,
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:47.460]   especially with cybersecurity,
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:49.660]   which is becoming more and more of an issue,
[02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:50.740]   which is hacking.
[02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:56.900]   Sort of people that look a lot like me
[02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:59.980]   being the warriors of the future,
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:03.420]   which is meaning people behind a keyboard
[02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:07.460]   versus the traditional warriors.
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:09.540]   - Probably inevitable.
[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:12.100]   Yeah.
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:13.020]   - And terrifying.
[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:14.660]   - It is, it is.
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:18.020]   But I think if you believe that it's possible,
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:19.540]   it's certainly gonna happen.
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:22.460]   Like, at some point, it's just when, right?
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.380]   When does it happen?
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:25.660]   - So that, I mean, to me,
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:29.100]   I'm ultimately optimistic about the future,
[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:31.700]   and to me, I'm excited about the world with AI.
[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:34.980]   I'm even excited about the metaverse
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:36.500]   and all these kinds of things,
[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:38.700]   living more and more in the digital space,
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:39.960]   in the virtual reality.
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.260]   I think, so it's a part of me that grew up
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:45.540]   in the non-internet world, non-computer world.
[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:49.740]   It says, "Oh, kids these days with their video games."
[02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:52.340]   There's part of me that's like that.
[02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:56.940]   But I think what's, technology at its best
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.860]   can bring out the best of humanity.
[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:03.140]   And so I think virtual reality, all of these things,
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:06.740]   over time, we'll figure out how to fix it
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:08.100]   to bring out the humanity.
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:12.100]   Social networks, the first generation social networks,
[02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:13.660]   now Facebook, Twitter, and so on,
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.020]   they have so many problems.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:17.100]   They're bringing out the worst in people.
[02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:18.620]   But I think we're learning from that,
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:20.580]   and I think the next generation of social networks
[02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:22.380]   will be better and better and better.
[02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:26.020]   And so I'm optimistic.
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:30.940]   But of course, one reason we may have not seen aliens yet,
[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:34.180]   obviously, like in a way that's obvious,
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:36.980]   is because once you get clever and smart
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:40.220]   and have all this cool technology, you destroy yourself.
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:42.980]   And we sure as humans are pretty close to that.
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:45.060]   - Yeah, yeah, there might be that limit
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:46.940]   that is hard to get right.
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:49.860]   - I'm hoping we get all our aggression between nations out
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:52.380]   through arm wrestling competition.
[02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:53.340]   - Right?
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.740]   - Just all of that.
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:58.620]   - Oh my God, wouldn't that be great if it was that simple?
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:07:59.460]   Yeah.
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:01.540]   - Do you know if there's another over-the-top type movie
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:02.380]   to be made?
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:04.820]   - Oh yeah, yeah, there's always stuff in the works.
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:07.740]   There's actually a tournament called Over the Top
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:09.860]   in Australia that's a couple months away.
[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:11.700]   I think they're doing an all-the-over-top scene.
[02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:13.940]   But there are arm wrestling movies
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:14.980]   that are being made right now.
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:17.900]   Actually, there's a documentary that's filming me
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:19.620]   for this whole LaVon thing.
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:23.020]   But yeah, we're probably due for another big one.
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:26.340]   - But you're also, just with your YouTube channel,
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:27.540]   you're doing a lot for the sport.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:28.540]   That's really cool to see.
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:31.400]   Just being genuine, but just being like,
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:33.820]   looking not like you're looking today,
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:34.660]   but just like--
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:35.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:36.340]   - Just a beard.
[02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:37.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, normally I'm not--
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:39.780]   - Just like sleepy, you know,
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:42.860]   and just putting yourself out there completely as you are.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:44.260]   That's a beautiful thing.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:45.460]   - The best thing about the sport
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:47.100]   is it brings people together.
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:47.940]   That's it.
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:50.220]   - Yeah, the community, the folks I got to interact with,
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:51.820]   just so awesome.
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:54.300]   So excited, so full of kindness.
[02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:55.940]   I'm definitely gonna find the club here
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:09:00.940]   and start working on my arm wrestling game.
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:03.900]   Devin, this is such a huge honor
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:07.220]   that you would spend your valuable time.
[02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:09.020]   You would come down to Austin.
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:14.020]   You would hang out with me and do this conversation.
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:16.140]   - Super cool to talk to you, Lex, yeah.
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:18.940]   - As I mentioned, in case people, you know,
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:20.940]   people I'm sure will tell me.
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:23.380]   So I hang out with Joe Rogan all the time.
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:24.380]   He's a friend.
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:25.980]   I told him that he should talk to Devin.
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:29.100]   He's going through some stuff currently, you know,
[02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:31.180]   but I'm sure, I hope the conversation
[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:33.820]   between you, Devin, and Joe happens eventually.
[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:37.820]   That would be epic as well 'cause he's a--
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:39.780]   - Yeah, he loves fighting.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:43.380]   - He loves fighting, he loves wrestling, he loves strength,
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:48.380]   and I think all of those are like so perfectly encapsulated
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:50.980]   in the sport of arm wrestling.
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:52.620]   So thank you so much for talking to me, brother.
[02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:54.020]   - Hey, thanks so much, Lex.
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:55.820]   (laughing)
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:57.340]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:58.660]   with Devin Larratt.
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:09:59.980]   To support this podcast,
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:02.860]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.060]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:07.660]   from Miyamoto Musashi.
[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:11.860]   "The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:15.540]   And the only reason a warrior fights is to win."
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:19.780]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:22.380]   (upbeat music)
[02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:24.980]   (upbeat music)
[02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:34.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
