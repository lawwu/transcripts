[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.900]   - Okay everyone, we have to stay on track,
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.920]   so let's go ahead and get started.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.600]   Before we get into Dr. Jim Dolley's session though,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.880]   just want to mention that all of the slides
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.520]   that you're seeing today, and really any slides
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.000]   that you'll see during the course of this conference,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.080]   will be available on the Bogle Center's website.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.800]   The URL is boglecenter.net,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.520]   and so you'll just go to the conference page,
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.760]   go to the agenda, and you'll see a spot
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   to download the slides.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.180]   So no need to feverishly take notes,
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.760]   we got you covered with the presentations.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.520]   And we see that we've got a lot of questions coming in,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.880]   which is fabulous.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.320]   So Dr. Jim Dolley has been leading the sessions next door.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.480]   Jim has been absolutely fabulous to us at Bogleheads.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.260]   He's been such a wonderful member of our community
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.560]   for so many years.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.000]   I think he's one of the most prolific posters
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.040]   on bogleheads.org.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.240]   And he has his own empire over at White Coat Investor,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   which is a website, podcast, book series, conference,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280]   geared toward healthcare professionals.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.600]   So Jim has written several books
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.080]   under the White Coat Investor name.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.700]   He's got the White Coat Investor podcast.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.320]   He runs a fabulous conference every year,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.200]   and I will say that we have gotten a little bit
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.920]   of a twofer with Jim, which is that Jim's wife Katie
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.720]   helps put on their amazing conference,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.200]   and Katie has been here every step of the way
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.300]   helping us make this conference run smoothly.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.440]   So we are so grateful to them
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.740]   for being part of our Bogleheads community.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.680]   Jim is going to talk about asset allocation.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.280]   He's going to expand on what I talked about in my session,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.080]   but he'll share some specific examples.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.620]   Please join me in welcoming Jim Dolley.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.780]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.640]   - All right, it's great to be with you.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300]   I'm sorry, I've missed all the other sessions in here.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.560]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.320]   Okay, all right, so Christine's talk dealt
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.760]   with a lot of theory and a lot of how-tos
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.960]   on your asset allocation.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.400]   In this talk, we're gonna try to get
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.600]   a little bit more into the nuts and bolts,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.760]   which means I gotta actually share opinions,
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.960]   and bear in mind that my opinions are not gospel.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.440]   Some other people's opinions disagree with my opinions,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.480]   and that's okay, but I think it's helpful to hear opinions.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.960]   And so we'll be going over a bunch of portfolios
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.320]   as part of this and talking about my opinions.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.080]   All right, before we get into that,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.000]   a few disclosures and disclaimers.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.580]   I am not a financial advisor.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.400]   I'm not an accountant, I'm not an attorney.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.700]   I'm not licensed to do anything in this state.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   So this is all for entertainment and information only.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.920]   I do have a conflict of interest.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.760]   I own a company called the White Coat Investor.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.860]   I have dozens or hundreds of advertisers there
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.100]   with whom I have financial conflicts of interest.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.440]   I'm not gonna mention any of those.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.560]   The only company I'm gonna mention today is Vanguard,
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.900]   and I'm still trying to talk them into advertising with me.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.540]   So even there, I have no conflict of interest.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.000]   We're gonna talk about these three things.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.980]   We're gonna talk about some principles to consider
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.440]   when building your portfolio,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.800]   and then we're gonna go through a long list of portfolios
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.760]   that I consider reasonable,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.280]   and then through a list of portfolios
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.320]   that are extreme and not reasonable.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.840]   And I think this is a helpful exercise
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.680]   for people who haven't done this before.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.200]   Okay, this is me sleeping on the side of Half Dome
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.740]   a month ago.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.480]   After climbing for 24 hours,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.160]   I managed to get 45 minutes of sleep there
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.960]   before continuing the climb.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.200]   If I look like I'm hallucinating, I probably am,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   but that is not reasonable, okay?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.240]   Like many of the portfolios we'll discuss today.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.080]   All right.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.540]   Your goal is to avoid extreme portfolios.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.000]   You know, extreme sports might be fun.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.420]   Extreme portfolios are not.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.140]   You want a portfolio that's likely to do well
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.140]   in a wide range of potential future economic scenarios.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.580]   You cannot know the perfect portfolio in advance.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.740]   You cannot know it.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.240]   Quit trying to find it.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.340]   The efficient frontier is defined retrospectively.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.580]   You want to find a good enough portfolio
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.800]   and then stick with it.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.160]   That is what you want, a good enough portfolio.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.380]   This would be static,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.820]   meaning it has set percentages
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.020]   that you can regularly rebalance to.
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.620]   It's broadly diversified and has low costs, okay?
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.620]   So instead of trying to come up
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.500]   with the most reasonable portfolio,
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.060]   you can just pick one.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.300]   That's okay.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.180]   If you'll stick with it, it'll be fine.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.840]   Every asset class in it will have its day in the sun.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.180]   A reasonable portfolio, okay?
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.620]   If there is a slide to remember,
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.260]   if there's a slide to take a picture of, it's this one, okay?
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.020]   We'll have at least 50% of the assets in it
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.500]   in stocks, bonds, and real estate, okay?
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.180]   Not wacky stuff, okay?
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.380]   Stocks, bonds, real estate
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.400]   should be the majority of your portfolio.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.460]   25% or more needs to be in risky assets.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.620]   If not, it's unlikely to keep up with inflation.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.740]   It's unlikely to reach your goals.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.020]   It turns out if you only invest in safe stuff,
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.460]   you gotta save a lot of money,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.200]   like 50% of your gross income for 30 years
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.540]   in order to retire comfortably.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.380]   It's a lot.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.060]   You want to have 20% or less,
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.060]   0% is fine, in speculative investments.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.680]   You want to have at least 20 individual securities.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.520]   I mean, if you buy total stock market index,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.560]   you're getting 4,000 securities in 30 seconds.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.720]   Have at least 20 in your portfolio, please.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.300]   And no individual security or property,
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.540]   if you're a real estate investor,
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.620]   should really be more than 5% of your portfolio.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.800]   You want to have at least three asset classes
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.040]   as well as a general rule.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.120]   Okay, what really matters in investing?
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   If you want to get rich,
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.720]   if you want to be financially independent,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.320]   if you want to reach your financial goals,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.960]   if you want to be comfortable in retirement,
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.720]   here's what matters.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.680]   Fund it adequately.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.880]   It's less important what's in the account
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.400]   than how much you put in the account.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.840]   That's what really matters.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.080]   The younger you are, the more it matters.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.000]   Your savings rate matters.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.960]   After that, a reasonable portfolio and sticking with it.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.520]   All right, here is my son and my wife
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.840]   who gave you all your badges down there
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.560]   on the Grand Teton in August.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.960]   Again, not something that's reasonable to do,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.680]   but a lot of fun.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.640]   They're gonna teach us a little bit
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.120]   about reasonable portfolios.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.240]   Okay, here's the first reasonable portfolio
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.080]   I'll throw up there.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.220]   Putting all your money into the S&P 500 Index Fund,
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.780]   or putting it all into the Total Stock Market Index Fund.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.520]   The pros of that portfolio are that it's very, very simple.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.040]   You only gotta remember one thing,
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.560]   and that fund is gonna be available
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.400]   in every retirement account you have.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.600]   There's hundreds or thousands even of individual securities.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.920]   It's got a great track record.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.500]   It's very easy to know your performance.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.200]   It's put on the TV every night.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.000]   The downside, it's not so diversified.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.360]   It's really only one asset class, large U.S. stocks.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.520]   It's only one country, and there's no factor investing.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.320]   And if you end up with a lost decade, like the 2000s,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.600]   you may not be super happy with your returns.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.120]   Next one, this one's very popular on the Bogleheads Forum.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.100]   This is what we call the three-fund portfolio.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.080]   It's money in the Total Stock Market Index,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.920]   the Total International Stock Market Index,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.620]   and the Total Bond Index.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.760]   The benefit, well, if you do poorly,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.880]   you're gonna have a lot of friends
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.720]   that are doing just as poorly.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.880]   You'll have a lot of camaraderie.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.720]   A lot of people love this portfolio.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.120]   Taylor Laramore may be the most profound advocate for it,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.880]   but there's plenty of others.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.240]   You do get three separate asset classes like that.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.080]   Downsides, there's no tips.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.200]   There's no international bonds.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   There's no muni bonds.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.800]   There's no factors to tilt to.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.400]   There's no alternatives in it.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.280]   It does have downsides, but it's certainly reasonable.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.360]   Number four, this is the four-fund portfolio,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.120]   popularized by Rick Ferry, okay?
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.240]   You take the three-fund and you add a REIT fund to it
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   in some sort of percentage.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.920]   You get an extra asset class for that
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.340]   because real estate is often not, you know,
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.440]   included in publicly traded stocks.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.480]   It's maybe a little bit closer
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.100]   to what the real economy is like.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.000]   Still, there's no tips, no international bonds,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.440]   no muni bonds, no factors, no alternatives.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.940]   And it's a pretty decent bet on real estate outperformance.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.040]   Okay, five, six, and seven, I like these.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.000]   These are all available at Vanguard.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.440]   And they're one-fund solutions.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.620]   You got the Total World Stock Market Fund,
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.320]   which is basically the US stocks and international stocks.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.760]   You got the Balanced Index Fund,
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.360]   which is US stocks and US bonds.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.040]   You've got the Tax Managed Balance Fund,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.600]   which is the same thing, run a little bit differently
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.760]   to try to decrease the tax hit on you.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.600]   The benefits of these are they're very simple.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.320]   It's one fund, it automatically rebalances.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.720]   The downside is with each of these,
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.800]   you're really only getting two asset classes.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.840]   And it might be cheaper to roll your own
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.800]   than to let Vanguard combine them for you.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.860]   And of course, none of these are really available
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.740]   very commonly in employer retirement plans.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.440]   These ones are very popular as well.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.080]   In fact, you have already heard today,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.120]   or you will soon hear from a very serious advocate
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.520]   of this investing method.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.320]   The Life Strategy Funds at Vanguard are very cool.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.280]   They're basically the three-fund portfolio,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.040]   except you don't have to remember to buy all three funds.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.000]   You only gotta buy one.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.080]   They will automatically rebalance for you.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.340]   And you will have the same return
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.360]   if you invest in the Moderate Growth Fund.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.740]   You'll have the same return as Mike Piper,
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.120]   which is a wonderful thing to have.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.080]   That's what he invests in.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.480]   That's his entire portfolio.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.100]   Downside, not available in all employer plans.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.840]   There's no factors, there's no alternatives.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.320]   It doesn't adjust automatically as you age.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.880]   And it's probably not that great
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.840]   if you have a significant portion of your assets
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.880]   in a taxable account.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.240]   Okay, similarly to that,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.360]   we have the Target Retirement Funds, okay?
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.400]   And there's a whole bunch of them.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.600]   There's a dozen or more.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.760]   They go from 2060 to the Income Fund.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.000]   And the benefit, you only gotta buy one fund.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.440]   It automatically rebalances.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.720]   It automatically becomes less risky
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.760]   as you approach that retirement date.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.800]   And it's available in lots of retirement accounts.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.000]   If the Vanguard ones aren't,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.520]   there's some from several other companies
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.100]   which are almost as good that you can use.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.560]   Do not invest in this in a taxable account.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.000]   You will regret it.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.800]   Couple of years ago, Vanguard distributed
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.040]   some pretty hefty capital gains to people
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.080]   that they were not expecting,
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.640]   who were invested in these funds in a taxable account.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.680]   Okay, how about this one?
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.880]   This one is known as the Coffeehouse Portfolio.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.500]   And it's got six asset classes,
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.800]   stock asset classes at 10% each,
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.240]   and then it's got 40% of your money in a bond fund.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.520]   So what's the benefits of that?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.420]   Well, you're getting tilts now.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.880]   You're overweighting these factors
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.580]   that are supposed to maybe do better in the long run,
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.000]   small in value.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.360]   You've got a relatively low
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.080]   international allocation in it, though,
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.720]   and you've certainly stepped up the complexity
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   compared to those other investing options we talked about.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.040]   There's still no TIPS or MUNIs or international bonds,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.160]   and I'm not a real big fan of the 500 index fund
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.960]   over a total stock market fund.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.220]   Granted, the differences are trivial,
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.200]   but I figure, hey, why have 500 stocks
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.400]   when you can have 4,000?
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.360]   All right, here's one.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.160]   This one's actually my portfolio.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.720]   Okay, it's 25% in the total stock market index,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.980]   15% in small cap value,
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.000]   15% in the total international stock market,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.080]   5% in small international,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.540]   10% in TIPS, 10% in nominal bonds,
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.640]   20% in real estate,
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.120]   and it's divided between some public
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.820]   and some private real estate.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.740]   So what are the pros of this portfolio?
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.160]   Well, there's some tilts to real estate and to factors,
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.800]   if you believe in that sort of stuff.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.720]   There's some cons, though.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.560]   It's a moderately complex portfolio.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.400]   It's a very complex portfolio
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.600]   if you use private real estate to do it,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.400]   and it's a pretty big bet on small value,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.760]   which, if you want to know the truth,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.580]   since I started investing in 2004, has not paid off.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.280]   They're talking about that next door right now.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.080]   Paul Merriman's advocating for this sort of a portfolio.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.820]   Rick Ferrier's arguing against it.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.180]   I still think it's gonna pay off
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.920]   during my investing horizon, but there's no guarantee.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.320]   Welcome to factor investing.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.180]   Okay, here's one, and the type just got smaller.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.920]   I apologize to those of you in the back,
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.880]   but this is what happens
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.080]   when Paul Merriman puts together a portfolio, okay?
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.960]   This is the ultimate buy-and-hold portfolio.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   It's 6% into each of 10 different stock asset classes,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.280]   and then 40% into a bond fund.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.120]   What's the pros?
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.160]   Well, there's lots of tilts.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.520]   If you believe in these factors,
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   if you believe they're gonna pay off, you've got 'em, okay?
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   Downside, well, this is pretty highly complex.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.400]   It still uses the 500 index over a total stock market,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.640]   and I think it's really weird
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.160]   to have 10 stock asset classes, 10 funds in the stocks,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.960]   and one in the bonds.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.360]   That just seems really odd to me, so.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.360]   If you're gonna slice and dice,
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.060]   why wouldn't you slice and dice the bonds, too?
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.480]   I don't know.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.680]   All right, this one here comes
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.060]   from one of Bill Bernstein's books.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.800]   This is the Sheltered Sam 60/40 portfolio,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.440]   and you can see it's got all kinds
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   of different numbers up there.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.880]   It's got 12% in the 500 index, 15% in the value index,
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.160]   3% in the small-cap index, 9% in the small-cap value index,
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.920]   6% in REITs, 1.8% in precious metals,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.220]   3% in each of the Europe, Pacific,
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.700]   and emerging markets sectors of the international stocks,
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.220]   4.2% in the International Value Fund,
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.980]   and then it's got the bonds split
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.620]   between the short-term corporate bonds, and 16% in TIPS.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.440]   See what I mean about how there's a gazillion
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.700]   different ways you can do this?
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.540]   Is this reasonable?
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.940]   Yes.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.260]   There's lots of tilts in factor investing.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260]   Again, if you believe in that and want to do that
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.740]   and want to deal with that complexity
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.180]   in hopes of higher long-term returns,
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.920]   this portfolio has that.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.660]   Maybe it captures a bit of a rebalancing bonus
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.180]   by splitting up your total international stock fund
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.060]   into those three components,
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.500]   but you're adding a lot of complexity to get that,
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.180]   and again, it uses the 500 index over TSM.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.300]   Honestly, I don't know that there's really any point
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.120]   to putting anything in your portfolio.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.940]   If you don't believe in it enough
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.840]   to put at least 5% into it,
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.340]   maybe you shouldn't have it at all.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.180]   It's my thoughts on it.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.980]   Don't tell Bill, he's in the next room.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.500]   All right, here's another one.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.300]   30% US stocks, 20% international stocks,
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   10% TIPS, 10% US, 10% international, 10% real estate,
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.480]   5% in gold, and 5% in Bitcoin.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.320]   What are the pros?
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.180]   Well, if you want to have a little bit of your money
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.020]   and some speculative assets, this portfolio has that,
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.100]   and yet it doesn't bet the farm on them,
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.280]   so I'm okay with that sort of portfolio.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.180]   I think that's reasonable.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.020]   Downsides?
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.700]   It doesn't happen to have any factor investing.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.540]   All right.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:26.020]   Okay, this is the Pit of Despair.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.820]   It's found in southern Utah,
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.460]   and if you ever find yourself there,
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.500]   may you be prepared to cross and get out of it.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.160]   It is not a reasonable place to be,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.660]   but it's incredibly beautiful.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:44.060]   Okay, here's unreasonable portfolio number one.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.540]   1/3 in vacant land, 1/3 in gold,
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.740]   1/3 in fine art.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.780]   Okay, what's the problem here?
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.100]   Well, I can't really think of any pros.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.320]   Outside of a very apocalyptic worldview,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.520]   I don't know why anybody would hold this portfolio.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.820]   It's 100% speculative.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.480]   You're getting no earnings, dividends, interest, rents.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.620]   Nothing is coming out of this portfolio,
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.020]   other than you're hoping somebody else
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.700]   will pay you more for the assets than you paid for them.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.900]   Okay, here's another one,
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.060]   and this one seems very specific, I admit,
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.220]   and that's because somebody actually emailed me in
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.380]   and asked what I thought about this portfolio.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.900]   1% in gold mining stocks,
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.460]   using an actively managed mutual fund
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.980]   with an expense ratio of 1.5%,
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.300]   44% in gold, bullion in this case,
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.780]   and 55% in treasury bills.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.720]   Well, this one might do okay in a massive downturn,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.820]   but it's gonna have low volatility
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.100]   with all that money in cash,
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.540]   but it's unlikely to keep up with inflation.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.340]   It's extremely speculative.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.260]   Why in the world would you pay 1.5% for anything, you know?
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.920]   So, not a reasonable portfolio.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.700]   Okay, this one also somebody sent in to me.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.540]   Okay, 7.5% in commodities,
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.500]   same in gold mining stocks and emerging market stocks.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.660]   Then they had 15% of the portfolio
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.220]   in something I couldn't even figure out what it was,
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.900]   rare physical assets.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.920]   Is that Beanie Babies?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.760]   What is that?
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.060]   5% was their hobby trading account,
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.420]   which I don't have a problem with.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.060]   If it's only 5% of your portfolio in something weird,
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.620]   that's okay.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.100]   5% in tips and then 52% in money market.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.260]   Well, you know, the perma bears are every now
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.660]   and then they're right.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.140]   But for most of the time,
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.480]   you don't wanna be investing in this sort of weird stuff.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.100]   It's unlikely to keep up with inflation.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.340]   It's very speculative.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.540]   And frankly, 100% of your stocks are in emerging markets?
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.420]   Really?
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.020]   That seems like an incredible bet on emerging markets.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.700]   So, not a reasonable portfolio.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.980]   How about this one?
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.340]   Apple, Bitcoin, cash,
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.400]   and your brother-in-law's small business.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.340]   I guess it could be worse.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.260]   Maybe it's all in your brother-in-law's small business.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.120]   But this portfolio takes on uncompensated risk.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.940]   It's got way too much speculation in crypto.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.620]   And don't invest significant amounts
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.660]   with your family and friends.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.920]   You're gonna ruin the relationship.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.060]   You'll probably lose your money too,
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.620]   but you'll definitely ruin the relationship.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.480]   Not reasonable.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.200]   Okay, how about this one?
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.740]   This is the permanent portfolio.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.060]   Stocks, cash, gold, long-term bonds,
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.540]   all split 25% apiece.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.180]   Now, you're probably likely to do better
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.420]   than most portfolios if the Great Depression happens again.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.100]   I will admit that.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.780]   But the problem is that there are bets in this portfolio
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.480]   on less likely scenarios.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.340]   And the truth about investing
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.020]   is that it should be titled the triumph of the optimists.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.180]   Because over the long run,
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.560]   the optimists have been very much been right
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.980]   when it comes to investing.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.740]   And you're taking a lot of your portfolio
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.380]   and saying, I think there's a high chance
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.100]   bad things are gonna happen.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.660]   And that's the problem I have with the permanent portfolio.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.620]   Okay, this one, I meet lots of people
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.820]   that are into real estate investing.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.580]   Now, I don't have a problem with real estate investing.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.900]   As you saw, I invest in real estate myself.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.940]   But I think putting it all in real estate's a mistake.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.700]   It's just too easy to invest
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.720]   in the most profitable corporations
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.180]   in the history of the world.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.740]   In 30 seconds, you can buy them all.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.780]   And not even think about them ever again.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.140]   I think it's silly not to have
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.860]   20 or 25% of your money in stocks,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.200]   even if you love real estate investing.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.180]   It's just one asset class and avoids all those stocks.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.700]   And of course, there's massive impact
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.260]   on a real estate downturn or interest rate changes.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:25.100]   All right, how about this one?
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.260]   40% in QQQ, 10% in Tesla, 10% in Apple,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.480]   20% in the Vanguard large growth stock index,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.020]   and 20% in cash.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.140]   Well, the problem here is
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.420]   this person thinks they're diversified,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.180]   but each of their holdings is actually owning the same stocks
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.100]   so it's false diversification.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.680]   And of course, uncompensated risk
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.220]   with the individual companies.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.940]   Not reasonable.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.240]   Okay, how about this one?
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.660]   25% cash, 25% bonds, 25% gold, 25% whole life insurance.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.500]   Is it diversified?
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.320]   Sure.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.540]   Is it gonna have low volatility?
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.420]   Absolutely.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.660]   What's the problem?
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.020]   The problem is you need to save 50% of your gross income
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.140]   for 30 years to get as much as you need.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.740]   It's not gonna reach your financial goals.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.000]   These are all very low returning asset classes.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.940]   You're not taking enough risk.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.860]   Not reasonable.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.620]   Okay, again, reasonable portfolio characteristics.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.460]   At least 50% in stocks, bonds, and real estate
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.140]   instead of weird stuff.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.980]   25% at least in risky assets.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.940]   20% or less in speculative stuff.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.000]   20 plus individual securities.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.540]   No individual security or property
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.100]   more than 5% of the portfolio
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.400]   and at least three asset classes.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.260]   What matters?
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.340]   Funded adequately.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.180]   Reasonable portfolio.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.140]   Stick with it.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.860]   That's what matters in investing.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.820]   Stay the course.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.300]   I think that's my last slide, yes.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.340]   Thank you for your attention.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.500]   (audience applauding)
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   (audience cheering)
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.660]   (audience applauding)
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:07.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
