[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   So I want to talk today about the desire to build a good life.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.880]   One that's focused on what you care about.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.140]   One that feels meaningful.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.000]   One where the appeal of zoning out on your phone or losing hours to mindless video game
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.780]   playing is diminished.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.200]   Now I have a specific strategy for achieving this goal that I want to talk about in today's
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200]   episode.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   It's one that's going to pull from both my background as a computer scientist as well
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.400]   as from the habits of a reclusive writer.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.760]   So this should be fun.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.200]   I call it the good life algorithm.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   Let's get into it.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200]   All right.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.880]   I am going to start and my apologies for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.200]   I'm going to draw something.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.640]   So this is always a risk.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.980]   I haven't done this in a little while, Jesse.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.800]   New viewers of the podcast are not used to my artistic skills, but here we go.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.880]   I want to draw a picture that's going to help coordinate us here.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.600]   I have a big box on the screen.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600]   Okay.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   So I want to think about this box as capturing possible lives.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.520]   Let's say it that way.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.080]   Now within this space of possible lives that you could live, only some of them are actually
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.440]   achievable.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.100]   So we'll draw like a region within this, this bigger space here.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.200]   So if you're just listening, I'm drawing this region is green.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.840]   So within this space of possible lives, we kind of have a region of things that are actually
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.960]   reasonably achievable.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.280]   So for example, here's a life outside of that region that might be becoming a Cy Young award
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.700]   winning pitcher.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.480]   If this was my diagram of achievable lives, I mean, I'm not quite there, Jesse.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.240]   I still have some hope, but I'm rapidly getting to the point where like I'm probably not going
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120]   to be able to make it to that.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   I'll probably not be a Cy Young award winning pitcher.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.360]   So there's lives in here that are achievable.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.560]   All right.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.040]   And what we want to do is get to the achievable lives that are deep or good.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.080]   It's like, I don't know, I'm, I'm drawing a couple possible lives in here.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.360]   I'm going to highlight one of them.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.900]   Like maybe this life right here, I have drawn up here, this achievable life that I've circled.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.400]   Maybe that is like a really good one.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.000]   That's one that would satisfy our definition of deep, meaning that if you could live that
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.280]   life, it would feel meaningful, it would feel interesting, the appeal of being just distracted
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   on your phone would be reduced.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   Like that, that's a goal.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.120]   And then maybe like right now you're, you're down, we're like down here.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.220]   So I'll circle life, you know, down here on the side.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.280]   The whole challenge, we want to think about this visually, the whole challenge of trying
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.160]   to cultivate a deep life is to try to get from wherever you are to one of these possible
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.920]   deep lives that's going to be much better.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400]   That is the challenge of trying to do some sort of lifestyle design.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   So the question is, how do we actually achieve that?
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.680]   Well, what most people do is what I often call on the show, the grand goal strategy.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.040]   This is where you pick an appealing sounding grand goal and just go for it and hope that
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.920]   it will, if achieved, make your life better all at once.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.160]   Well, when we have this diagram, this landscape of possible lives, it allows us to visualize
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.000]   the problem with this strategy, because here's what actually happens if you apply the grand
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.160]   goal strategy.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.400]   You can think about each of these possible lives that I've drawn here, it's a two-dimensional
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   picture.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.120]   So they exist on, they're going to exist on two axes, right?
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.080]   So we can think about each of these points as being described by two values in this particular
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   simple example.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.960]   So like how far it is on this vertical line and how far it is on this horizontal line.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.600]   So I don't know, we can just make up properties, but maybe like this horizontal line describes
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.000]   like number of hours per day spent reading Brandon Sanderson books.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.320]   So higher is more, lower is less.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.280]   And maybe this one over here, the horizontal line represents like hours spent working per
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.680]   day.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.920]   And so like as we move over here, you're working more hours and as your points over here, working
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920]   less hours.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   Like every point in this simplified example has some combination.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.880]   In reality, of course, your lives will be defined by hundreds of relevant points.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.680]   I can't draw in a hundred dimensional space, so let's just use two for this example.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.760]   What happens when you apply the grand goal strategy is, to simplify it a little bit,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   you're basically choosing one of these axes.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.560]   So like one of these points you care about, and then just leaping in that direction.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.600]   Hey, this is something I care about.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.760]   My grand goal is going to take one of these properties and just take that singular property
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.020]   and try to greatly amplify that in my life.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.240]   So for example, maybe you say, "I know I like reading Brandon Sanderson books, so I'm going
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.180]   to find an opportunity, a big grand goal that's going to increase that."
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.300]   And maybe you decide, "I am going to start a full-time business making novelty t-shirts
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.620]   with esoteric quotes from Brandon Sanderson books."
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.040]   You're going to read them all day, like looking for quotes.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.940]   And so you make a big leap up that axis, but that's the only thing you care about.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.660]   So where might you end up?
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.080]   All you do know is that you're going to be increasing that one thing, and maybe you end
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   up like up here.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.180]   So for those who are just listening, I've drawn something that is higher on the reading
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.440]   Brandon Sanderson scale, but it's also way far over on the hours of work scale because
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   you weren't thinking about that.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.940]   You were just trying to leap up.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.540]   So maybe for example, you start that novelty shirt company and you're working 15 hour a
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.180]   day trying to pay your bills because you got to sell a lot of shirts and there's not a
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.300]   big market and you're really having to hustle.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.880]   And so yes, you did improve, you did move, improve on this one factor, but you disregarded
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.880]   this other factor.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.940]   So yeah, you're reading a lot of Brandon Sanderson in this example, but you're also exhausted
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.440]   from how much you're working.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.360]   That's what happens with the grand goal strategy is it is a, think of it as a blunt way of
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.220]   moving through the landscape of possible lives.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.760]   You're just picking one of many dimensions that matters and just making a leap that increases
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.680]   that one dimension.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.320]   But where it puts you on the other dimensions might be a problem.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.440]   It's disregarding these other areas.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.220]   So what should you do instead?
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.040]   Well, this is where I want to turn and take some advice I mentioned from a reclusive author.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.100]   I'm going to bring up here an article on the screen and those who are listening, I mean
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.080]   watching instead of just listening can see this.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   Let's see here.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   Okay.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.260]   So this article, it's a podcast interview.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.440]   This is from Tim Ferriss' podcast.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.400]   Episode 361 of his podcast.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.360]   This is from six years ago, February of 2019.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.440]   I actually remember listening to this interview.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   I was shoveling snow.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.200]   I don't know if I remember that, Jesse, but I was shoveling snow.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.360]   There was a big snowstorm in February of 2019 here in DC.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.000]   The interview was with Jim Collins.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.480]   So Jim Collins is a former Stanford Business School professor who is a very well-known
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.600]   business book writer.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.040]   Good to Great and Build to Last are probably his two most famous books.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.860]   He sold something like 10 million total copies of his books, which puts him in like the elite
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.220]   of elite when it comes to nonfiction advice writing.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.920]   He left Stanford right around the time he was 38 years old.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.840]   So kind of similar to my age, just to write full time.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.520]   And he doesn't do a lot of public interviews.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.120]   So this was a big get for Tim, and we got some interesting insights into how Jim approached
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.080]   his life.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.320]   And so there's a part in here that I want to capture, because we're going to bring back
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.800]   this idea that Jim Collins talks about in his interview.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.460]   We're going to bring it back to that landscape of possible lives, and it's going to help
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.360]   us solve this problem of how do we more systematically make our way to better lives.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.360]   All right.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.440]   So I'm going to quote here from the interview.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.160]   Let me just set this up.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.680]   Tim has mentioned to Jim, like, hey, I've heard you mention that you use like a stopwatch
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.720]   to track things and that you track in particular each day how many hours you spend doing deep
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   work.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.240]   You put it in a spreadsheet, and you have this goal of like 1,000 hours a year of doing
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   deep work.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   Like, what's going on with this, Jim?
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.700]   Explain what's going on here.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.880]   And so he said, okay, here's what he explained.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.040]   Let me find the right quote.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Okay.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.600]   So he explained why he was doing that.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.480]   "I was worried what would happen if I went from being invisible to visible, and that
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.460]   if I was fortunate enough to have a success, that I might wake up in five or six or seven
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.640]   years and have not gone back to the wellspring of the deep, quiet solitude of work.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.420]   And then your second book is half as good, right?
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.200]   So I started, as I was heading out on the Thelma and Louise leap," he's referring here
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.360]   to leaping, being a professor, "counting my hours every day."
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   All right.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.360]   So that's how he got started.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.920]   He was counting his, how many hours did I spend doing creative work every day?
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.720]   Because he thought if that went down, like if you had a successful book and that went
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.780]   down, then he was never going to produce anything good again.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.360]   So he was going to track it to make sure.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.220]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:09.680]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.120]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.480]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.280]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   Check it out.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.640]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.680]   So Tim starts pushing them because Tim likes details.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   Okay.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   But Jim, like what is in the spreadsheet?
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.140]   Is it all your tracking, like every day, how many hours of deep work?
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.660]   And Jim revealed, I think for the first time, well, actually every line of my spreadsheets
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.000]   one day, I have three cells on each line.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.320]   So the first cell is actually a quick summary of what I did that day.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.580]   The second cell, as I talked about, was the number of hours I spent doing deep work.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.260]   What was interesting is the third cell, this is what's going to start getting us closer.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.260]   All right.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.260]   I'm going to read this.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.960]   There's kind of an exchange here that's worth hearing in full.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.140]   So here's what Jim says.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.980]   Now there's a third cell that I put in there that most people don't know as much about
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.620]   because people know about the hours thing somewhat.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:16.900]   But what I started to do is I started creating a code, which is +2, +1, 0, -1, -2.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.260]   And the other thing I put in, and the key on all of this, by the way, is you have to
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.900]   do it every day in real time.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.980]   You can't five days later, look back and say, how did I feel that day?
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.540]   So what this is is a totally subjective how quality was the day, or like a +2 is a super
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.800]   positive day.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.540]   So Ferris interrupts and says, you're talking about emotionally speaking?
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.100]   And Jim Collins says, exactly.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.860]   Just like, was it a great day?
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.820]   A +2 is just a great day.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.540]   It doesn't mean it wasn't.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.100]   There might not have been a really difficult day.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.100]   It might've been a day of total really hard rock climbing.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.220]   It might've been one of really hard riding, but if it felt really good, right, I'd put
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.220]   that down.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.460]   +1 is another positive day.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:57.300]   0 is meh, -1 is kind of a net tone negative, and -2 is bad days.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:02.280]   And so you can say over the last five years, what's going on in all of the +2 days?
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.400]   So Tim comes in and says, oh, so this is why you're writing the description of those days
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.660]   as well.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.660]   And here we get to the punchline.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.780]   Jim says, yeah, exactly.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.020]   And over the last five years, what's going on in the -2 days?
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.700]   And now as I navigate, it's kind of like the simplex method in operations research, where
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.660]   you find optimal by never knowing what optimal is ahead of time.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.740]   You do it by a series of iterative steps of the next best step.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.020]   This is where we get to the magic of Jim's advice.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.020]   I'm going to load back up my diagram here.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.940]   All right, this is where we get to the magic of his life.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:42.160]   He is saying, if I track every day, here's what I did, just a sentence or two, and here's
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.860]   if it was a +2 day, a +1 day, a 0 day, a -1 day, or a -2 day.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.580]   He can start to gather data, right?
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.900]   He can start to gather data about what am I doing on the +2 days?
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.340]   Also what am I doing on the -2 days?
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.820]   Like, what are the days I come away from saying that was really good, and what are the days
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.740]   that I come away from and saying that was really bad?
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.220]   And I can learn over time the type of stuff that makes me happy, and over time the type
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.140]   of stuff that doesn't make me happy, and he says, I can use that to make iterative changes
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.140]   in my life.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.340]   Now, this is where my computer science hat comes on.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.580]   He references the simplex algorithm.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.220]   The simplex algorithm, if you do any sort of like mathematical theory, is like an algorithm
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.060]   you use for finding feasible solutions for linear programs.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.260]   So linear programs is just basically where you say, maximize this value or this vector
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.300]   of values given a bunch of constraints on them.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.500]   You're trying to figure out like a really good answer to a question.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.020]   Think about it that way.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:40.220]   There's a lot of possible values you can assign, so how do you find like a set of values to
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.840]   assign that's really good?
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.460]   The simplex algorithm is a solution to that.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.180]   The details don't matter.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.340]   I mean, as you probably all know, and Jesse's shaking his head like a chorus, you're moving
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.420]   through a multidimensional polytope, which we understand through the vertexes of the
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.660]   multidimensional polytope.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.740]   We all know about this.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.740]   That's fine.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.320]   But the key is, if you actually look at the simplex algorithm operating, it's iterative.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.300]   So you're sort of moving ever closer towards an optimal solution.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.260]   So you don't know in advance where you're going, you're moving there.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:18.940]   So if we come back to our diagram here, looking at the landscape of possible lives, and we
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.140]   have the circle down here where we started, the Jim Collins simplex algorithmic approach
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.340]   is as you learn about, well, what days am I happy, what days am I not, you make a little
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.340]   change.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.100]   Well, I'm going to do a little bit more of this because I associate this with plus two
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.100]   days.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:42.220]   A little bit less of that because I associate that with minus two days.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.060]   Let me look at what's possible, and let me make this change here.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.940]   All these changes are small, and they're within the realm of what's possible, given just your
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.740]   current obstacles and opportunities, right?
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.100]   So there's no big grand scheme here.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.440]   You're not going off to start your Brandon Sanderson shirt business.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.540]   Small changes to get more plus twos and less minus twos.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.300]   And maybe some of these, eh, that didn't work out, but that's okay if it didn't work out
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.980]   because it's not a big change in your life.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:14.580]   Maybe we go over here, and you work your way iteratively towards that optimal solution.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.700]   You make your way towards a much better life.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.740]   This I think is a, it's not the only way to get to a deep life, but I think when we look
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.420]   at this diagram of the landscape of possible lives, and we imagine it as existing on these
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.700]   multiple dimensions, we really begin to see the difference between evidence-based iterative
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.740]   changes versus gut-based grand leaps.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.260]   It's just really hard to make a grand leap because you make one thing much better.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.340]   You might make another thing much worse.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.020]   Also, you don't have a great understanding of the full landscape between here and there.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.240]   What's actually around here?
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.980]   Maybe there's a lot of challenges around here.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.700]   This thing here is in some sort of fitness lull.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.740]   It's not as good as you think.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.860]   There's traps around it.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.940]   The iterative approach is not exciting this week, but over five years it leads you somewhere
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.300]   really cool.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.620]   Collins has built this really cool life.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.140]   He left academia and formed this really cool life that's built on doing this deep work
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.980]   and these other activities, and he's built these books that matter, but it's not fallen
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.900]   to the typical traps, the time traps that authors fall into.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.380]   I think it's really interesting, the iterative approach.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:27.420]   I have a friend who has been doing this for the last, it might have been five or six years.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.740]   He has the spreadsheet.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.340]   He has the plus and minuses.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:38.020]   He has the short description, and he has been changing his life bit by bit based on this
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.020]   data.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   I talk to him all the time.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.020]   I've heard him do this.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.500]   Right now, he's ended up in a really interesting, I'm going to say idiosyncratic, because it
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.980]   is never something that he or anyone else would have come up with from scratch if he
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.460]   was just thinking 10 years ago, "What do I want to do with my life?"
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.900]   But he has a fantastically deep and interesting, admirable life.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.780]   I'm actually going to go interview him for my "Deep Life" book.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.900]   I'm going to have him come on the podcast soon.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.460]   We'll do an in-depth episode to really get into it, but he was the one who really helped
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:08.220]   me come back to this concept of actually the data-based, evidence-based, iterative improvement
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.080]   of your life is much more likely to move you towards the good life than taking these big
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.460]   gut-driven swings.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.420]   Those could work, but often they don't.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.760]   They make one thing better while making other things worse, and then it can be just sort
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.820]   of a wash in the end.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.140]   For now, let's just sit with this idea.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.620]   The path to depth is sometimes iterative and not the result of major leaps.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.300]   I call that the good life algorithm.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   I like it.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.440]   I actually met Jim.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.180]   I don't remember how I got in touch with him, but it was probably after listening to that
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.180]   interview.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.180]   We had a good talk.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.180]   Good advice.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.020]   When I talked to him, I was like the exact age he was when he left Stanford.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.100]   He was like, "It works out pretty well if you go and just become a full-time writer."
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.740]   I didn't, but he did make an interesting pitch.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.460]   Well, you like teaching, right?
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.460]   I do like teaching.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.460]   He was in the business school.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.460]   It's kind of different, I think, too.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.460]   It's its own sort of business.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.460]   I mean, you're around some pretty smart kids.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.460]   It keeps you pretty young.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.380]   People leave business schools, I think, more than other type of academic schools because
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.060]   there's a lot of going out to start businesses or coming back to business schools after you've
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.060]   done something in business.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:20.180]   I think there's more of a revolving door than – though I would say at MIT, in the theory
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.260]   group in a computer science lab where I worked, people came and went.
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.980]   They would go, and then they would come back like $250 million richer.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.980]   There is a lot of that.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.420]   There is a lot of like Robert Morris would go, invent the first shopping cart for the
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.020]   web, and then come back with a lot of money.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.380]   Ron Rivest would go, sell RSA for $1.7 billion, and come back and start teaching.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.860]   So there was more of a revolving door just because –
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.980]   And then they'd buy you coffee in the break room?
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.460]   They did.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:56.060]   Ron Rivest, his personal secretary, B, was in charge of the coffee.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.620]   We had a lot of coffee on that floor.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.840]   It was none of this like little pot nonsense.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.620]   We had the professional brewers and the big, giant carafts, and we just had thing after
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.660]   thing of Pete's coffee.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.940]   Like the big where you could brew like 20 or 30 cups at a time and fill up one of those
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.780]   things like you would have at like a conference.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.780]   Yeah, we had a lot of coffee.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:23.500]   The good coffee machine was actually the floor below where the WC3 consortium is, so Tim
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.340]   Berners-Lee's web consortium.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.020]   So Tim Berners-Lee is the guy who's invented the HTML and HTTP and the World Wide Web.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.500]   So he worked on the fifth floor, and he's – I guess he's English.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.740]   He's a Sir, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and they had a fancy espresso machine, a really nice
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.740]   one.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.740]   Were you able to get any of that?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.740]   We would go down there sometimes.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.860]   We'd go down there sometimes.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.500]   Anyway, so there we go.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.860]   We'll call that the good life algorithm.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.860]   All right.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.860]   We've got a bunch of questions.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.940]   We're going to cover a lot of topics, but first, here from one of our sponsors.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.260]   I want to talk about our friends at Thrive Market.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.260]   Here's the thing.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.900]   My wife and I, we do a lot of online grocery shopping.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.520]   We learned this during the pandemic, like, "Oh, you can do this," and now it's become
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.220]   a bit of a habit because of the convenience of it.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.820]   The problem is you don't always know what you're going to get or the stuff you really
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.140]   want is not always available with the sort of standard online shopping stores.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.620]   You'll often have this experience where you'll say, like, "I don't know.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.220]   Can we get some bananas?" and they bring you a can of pineapples, and like, "Well,
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.900]   it's also yellow, so isn't that like a reasonable substitution?"
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.340]   So yeah, we kind of have trouble with them sometimes, but we're used to the idea of
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.380]   doing grocery shopping online.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.300]   This is why I love Thrive Market, because what they offer is a really good online shopping
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:45.740]   experience that is focused on, in particular, getting you healthy stuff, right?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:51.180]   So you can go online and buy stuff, and you know that you're going to get healthy essentials
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.980]   delivered.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.640]   One of the things in particular where this is really useful for us is that I have three
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.480]   boys and they eat a lot of snacks.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.320]   We have a snack box, and they grab their snacks in the morning, the pack for school or when
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   they get home.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.940]   The snack box plays a—it's a high-throughput food distribution service in our house, and
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.420]   we don't want them necessarily just eating a bunch of processed stuff.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.300]   This is like a perfect use of Thrive Market, like, "Oh, I'm going to go find snacks
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.300]   on Thrive Market.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.620]   I know they're going to be healthy."
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.140]   It's a no-junk online grocery store, and they'll just get sent straight to our house,
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.180]   and then we can keep filling up the snack box for it.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.720]   So that's like one of the ways I have been using Thrive Market.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.340]   They have a cool feature on there right now called Healthy Swap Scanner.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.180]   You can scan a product, and it will recommend a healthier alternative to it, which I think
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.020]   is a great idea.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.140]   The main way you can navigate is they have these on-site filters.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.700]   So if you have particular things you care about—I want high-protein, right?
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.880]   I want none of this—whatever it is you're searching for, you can filter real quickly
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.880]   to find those as well.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.820]   So if you want the convenience of online grocery, and you also want healthy stuff, you got to
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.840]   check out Thrive Market.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:05.740]   So if you're ready to make the switch, go to thrivemarket.com/deep to get 30% off your
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.860]   first order, plus a free $60 gift.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:17.660]   All right, that's thrivemarket.com/deep, Thrive Market dot com slash deep.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.980]   I also want to talk about our friends at Vanta.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.940]   Trust isn't just earned, it's demanded.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.180]   Whether you're a startup founder navigating your first audit or a seasoned security professional
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:35.100]   scaling your GRC program, proving your commitment to security has never been more critical or
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.300]   more complex.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.820]   That's where Vanta comes in.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:43.260]   Businesses use Vanta to establish trust by automating compliance needs over 35 frameworks
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.980]   like SOC 2 or ISO 27001.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.800]   I like to say double O because I'm a pretty hip computer scientist.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.380]   The nerds out there might say 27001, I say double O.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.260]   Centralized security workflows complete questionnaires up to five times faster and proactively manage
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.260]   vendor risk.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.340]   Vanta can help you start or scale your security program by connecting you with auditors and
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.160]   experts to conduct your audit and set up your security program quickly.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.020]   Plus with automation and AI throughout the platform, Vanta gives your time back so you
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.460]   can focus on building your company.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.860]   Join over 9,000 global companies like Alassian, Quora, and Factory who use Vanta to manage
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.900]   and improve security in real time.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.900]   All right, here's the deal.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:31.420]   My listeners will get $1,000 off Vanta if they go to vanta.com/deepquestions.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.140]   That's V-A-N-T-A.com/deepquestions for $1,000 off.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.180]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.940]   Hi, first question is from Chris.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.220]   How should I navigate the barrage of negative news as a federal worker?
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.740]   I feel like I should stay informed to understand how my livelihood might be impacted, but it's
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   very stressful.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.260]   Well, here's what's going on here.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.820]   If you're a federal worker, and half the people I know are, I live in Washington, D.C., at
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:07.220]   the moment when we're recording this, Elon Musk's doge is trying to do, among other things,
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.400]   psychological warfare.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:16.420]   He wants to terrorize the federal workforce because he is essentially, A, kind of a broken
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.780]   person inside, but B, he's mad about having to deal with federal regulators with some
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.780]   of his companies, right?
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:29.660]   So he wants to, beyond just finding inefficiencies or trying to save money, he wants to add a
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.500]   note of terror about it.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.660]   If you want to hear more about this, by the way, I wrote an article for The New Yorker
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.260]   last week.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:42.020]   Last week it came out, I think on Tuesday or Wednesday, that looked at Elon Musk's two
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.900]   weeks ago email that said, "Send me five things you did yesterday," which any manager will
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.900]   tell you is like what insecure managers do who are just trying to be a-holes.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.260]   I went through the whole history of, not just Musk, but productivity in Silicon Valley and
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.020]   seemed like they don't exactly have this figured out yet, but that's an aside.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.020]   He's trying to terrorize you.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.620]   So I'm saying don't give him the pleasure.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:07.420]   If you're not a congressional appointee or a probationary worker, you're most likely
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.160]   not in an imminent threat of your computer's going to be shut off at any moment.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.620]   So what I would suggest is you have a couple set check-in times.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.740]   What do I need to know about what has happened?
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:22.700]   It could be every day for 10 minutes, what's happening on the times, or maybe even like
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.540]   every other day you just check in to see what's going on.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.900]   But anything that directly you need to do something, also you're going to hear from
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.680]   your supervisor, you're going to hear from your agency heads, right?
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:39.360]   So extremely limit the time you check and when you check, and do not give it other time.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.720]   Do not be online following it.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.120]   Do not be on social media.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.760]   Don't be like sort of obsessively talking about it.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   Why?
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.400]   Because that is allowing Musk to live rent-free in your head, right?
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:25:00.480]   So if you actually want to do something here that is going to frustrate the person terrorizing
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.860]   you as hard as it might be, it's just don't look.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.840]   I'll check in briefly to see if what's going on, if I need to know something.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.540]   And otherwise, I'm going to do my job, I'm going to live my life.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.720]   You don't get a live rent-free in my head.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.060]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.920]   It's chaos and it's a bit of psychological warfare going on.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.400]   Let's not give him too much of the pleasure.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.760]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.440]   This is from Anthony, "Can you give a preview of your thoughts on relationships for your
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.280]   upcoming deep life book?
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.800]   What about if your partner does not like to geek out on systems, values, and stacks?"
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:41.280]   What you're talking about, your partner might not enjoy references to the simplex algorithm
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.920]   as a way of trying to navigate iterative improvement of your lifestyle configuration parameters?
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.400]   I don't believe it.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.180]   I will give you some reassuring words.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.560]   I do like to geek out.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.620]   The deep life book, which I'm working on now, and just for a timeline purpose, I'll probably
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.320]   finish the first draft at some point by the end of the summer.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.640]   So it's kind of a slow process.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.520]   I am not writing it in a super geeky tone.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:12.320]   So I am trying to write this book to be accessible even to people who aren't hopeless nerds like
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   myself.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.760]   So I'm hoping that's not going to be a problem.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   There's no stack in it.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.360]   I'm not using stack terminology.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.920]   I'm not going to talk about the simplex algorithm.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.960]   I might talk about the landscape of possible lives, but I might use more of an actual navigation
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   metaphor.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.720]   You're trying to get to a destination on an actual physical map, not in terms of a multidimensional
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.800]   vector or a linear program.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.180]   So I'm trying to be good, Anthony, about toning down the geekiness for the book, which I'm
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.800]   usually pretty good at, I think.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.120]   If you read Slow Productivity, my most recent book, it's not super geeky.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:56.640]   I'm trying to be more accessible, so like the larger audiences, so audiences who do
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.520]   not obsessively quote random scenes from season five of The Simpsons as if that's a reasonable
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.200]   conversational gambit.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.960]   People who think that's weird, I want to also be able to enjoy my book.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.680]   So I'm trying to de-geekify myself somewhat.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.160]   I've been pretty good about it, I think, Jesse.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.840]   I geek out a little bit more in here sometimes because I can't help myself, but my editors
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.440]   would not let me get away with it.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.800]   It's like publishing, it's all English majors.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   Like, come on.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   Stop talking about simplex algorithms.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.460]   I, by the way, held myself back.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.460]   I've done some research.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:31.440]   I won an award a few years ago, Best Paper Award, for a paper I did on a new application
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.520]   of an algorithmic analysis technique called smooth analysis, which was Spielman and Tang
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.440]   originally created this method for understanding why, in practice, the simplex algorithm converges
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.520]   faster than you might expect in the worst case.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.720]   And I took that same technique and applied it to some distributed system analysis.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.560]   So I could have gone a level deeper in my nerding, but I did not.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   So you're all welcome.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   All right.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   Who do we got next?
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.440]   Next question is from Rebecca.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.200]   I'm recovering from a health setback and struggle with creating a schedule for my projects.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.280]   Since I may need to adjust for rest in recovery, what approaches do you recommend for developing
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   a schedule that balances productivity with flexibility?
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.200]   Rebecca, I was just there.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.440]   And I'm like just coming out of a relatively still happening, but better rehab about a
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.280]   bunch of stuff that got messed up after I went through this sort of injury and surgery
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   recovery.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.480]   And here's what I basically learned, was start with like, OK, here's the schedule I think
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.360]   that like gives me some more rest, you know, so it's a little bit like I'm taking my foot
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.680]   off the gas a little bit, right?
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   So here's what I'm thinking.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.200]   I'm going to, you know, tell my boss or my supervisor, like, here's how I want to do
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.880]   it to try to prioritize rest a little bit more.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.280]   And take the amount of rest in that schedule and then multiply that by two.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   Like your initial reaction about what to do here is not going to be enough rest.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.920]   It's going to be the sort of minimum possible change because you're very worried.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.520]   It seems like in the moment, your brain interprets these changes that you're making to accommodate
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.460]   rest or rehab.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.440]   It interprets these as a permanent change.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.240]   And it begins to predict a future and say, my God, if I only work this much, you know,
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.600]   for the next 20 years, I'm going to really fall behind.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   I'm going to get fired.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.480]   I'm not going to be able to keep up with my job.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.920]   But the reality is you're probably talking three months or six months or one month or
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   whatever it is.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.740]   It's not actually that much time.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.240]   And all the time, people have to take their foot off the gas for three months or four
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.680]   months and then come back to it again.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.320]   So if you're going to take your foot off the gas, take your foot off the gas enough to
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.600]   really rehab and recover.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.440]   So that's my main advice is you probably need the rest more than your brain thinks is reasonable.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.880]   One of the things I actually like to do is collect just internally, I like to collect
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.460]   stories that I encounter of real historical figures who are super accomplished and they
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.840]   all have these like long periods where they were barely working.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.040]   You know, they were sick, they were dealing with this.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.940]   If you go back far enough, like in American history, I'm sort of a fan of colonial history
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.900]   and early post-colonial history.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.800]   You read these biographies of like founding fathers.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.880]   It would be, oh, for that month, they were just traveling from here to there, like just
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.920]   to get from here to there.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.640]   That was like a month of time that was just like, they weren't doing anything.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.160]   Like you read about, you know, Ben Franklin, there would just be these like six to two
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.040]   months, six weeks to two month gaps where it's like, well, he was traveling to London
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   and he just can't do anything.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.240]   You're just like on a ship and you're sick or you read about Darwin.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:32.520]   And for like a year, he's basically just throwing up on the Beagle, just like really seasick,
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   right?
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.600]   And so I find this, and I talk about this in Slow Productivity.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.640]   So if you want to get into these examples, get my book Slow Productivity, principle two
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.840]   is work at a natural pace.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.120]   And I really go through a lot of case studies here of people that we look back at the end
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.120]   of their lives.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.960]   We look back at these historical figures and say, wow, they produced all this stuff and
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   it was awesome.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   And I was like, yeah.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.480]   And they had all sorts of ups and downs and big, long extended periods where they were
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   doing nothing.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.800]   And then periods where they're really productive.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.920]   That is just the natural pace with which people produce things.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   Like here's another story.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.920]   I have so many of these.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.560]   Galileo, I believe this was Galileo.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:15.480]   He went at some point to stay with friends who had basically like a vacation home.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.320]   And it was up in the Italian mountains.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   And they had had this clever system, if I understand this correctly, that in their villa
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.640]   they built a series of chutes that take air from deep in a cave in the mountainside and
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.560]   bring it up into the villa because that air was cool.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.600]   So it was like air conditioner, right?
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   So it's pretty cool.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.640]   Like they built an air conditioning system.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:45.920]   It was pretty cool, literally cool, and also cool pragmatically, except for there was some
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.760]   sort of poisonous gas that was being vented into this cave.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.080]   And so Galileo is sleeping in this room with his villa with his friends on like vacation
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.180]   and it poisons everybody.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:00.200]   And it kills like two of the people in the room and he barely survives and is basically
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.920]   like debilitated for a really long time and never fully recovers from it.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   We don't know any of that.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.880]   Like, yeah, Galileo, we know the work he did, it was fantastic.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:16.000]   So like people have this, John F. Kennedy, you know, battling Addison's disease, huge
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   issues.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.160]   Like he'd be like, look, I got to just go down to the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.880]   and just be there for like three weeks.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.080]   Like they called that place the Southern White House or the White House South or whatever,
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.940]   because he'd be like, I just can't, I'm in pain, I can't move, like just weeks would
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.940]   be lost.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.720]   And then, you know, he'd do his best to work and come back.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:39.320]   Anyways, this is all to say, we are used to the modern pace of knowledge work that is
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.160]   set by the concept of pseudoproductivity, which is this heuristic I talk about in my
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.560]   most recent book, where we use visible activity as our proxy for useful effort.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:53.280]   In that type of mindset, anytime you're not doing something is like a disaster.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   And that's what leads to these thoughts of like, I can maybe like rest a little bit,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.600]   like take a little bit off my plate, but like anything more than that for more than a couple
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.200]   days is a disaster.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.480]   But when you do not have pseudoproductivity, when you're instead focused on like, I want
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.160]   to produce good stuff this year and this decade or the next three years, I have some big initiatives
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.840]   I want to go well, the fact that these three months you're not doing a lot of email or
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.680]   Zoom meetings because you're recovering from a surgery or something is not that big of
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.680]   a deal.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.880]   So if you need to get bucked up about resting more than you think you should, read while
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.200]   you're resting, read slow productivity, because that's sort of at the core, especially that
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.560]   second principle of working at a natural pace.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.480]   It really is, Jesse, like people don't know how artificial it is, this idea of even if
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.880]   I'm just finishing work at four for a few days, for a lot of people, they're in their
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.920]   mind, they'd be like, this is a disaster, which is crazy.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.600]   There's nothing they're doing where like not being there is like working to four instead
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.400]   of five is going to make some sort of major difference.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.760]   That's just a straight up pseudoproductivity.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.360]   All right, who we got next?
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.280]   Next question's from Shark Loffin.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.320]   I have the opportunity to lead the reboot of a once successful aerospace company of
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.720]   about 100 people.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.000]   I've got full autonomy to set everything from building to culture.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.960]   I'm going to attempt to use many of the ideas and deep work, including office layout, workflow
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   management.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:14.160]   The site is performing poorly and is best described as the most shallow workplace ever.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.040]   So much busy, so little production.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.720]   Any suggestions on how I can implement this transformation?
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.640]   Well, don't take a book out of Elon Musk's strategy.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.960]   I actually went through, this is a bit of a side, but for that New Yorker piece I was
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.480]   talking about, I went through and cataloged what happened in the first few months after
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.920]   he took over Twitter in 2022.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.200]   It just reminded me of this question.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:44.740]   It was, I would call it, haphazard random chaos that led nowhere good.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.740]   So don't do that.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:50.760]   That was just like, I'm going to start sporadically making declarations, losing interest in that
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.480]   declaration, then make another declaration, and then kind of lose interest in that, and
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.440]   then do this and lose interest in that, and then just fire half the people for no reason.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   So don't do that.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.440]   What should you do?
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.760]   I took a couple notes, but here's the big picture organizational principle for these
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.620]   notes I'm about to give you.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.240]   You need a small number of clearly identified, we'll call them North Stars, for the journey
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.000]   you're about to take with this company that you've taken over that you want to be really
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.240]   clear and transparent about.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.800]   Everything we're going to do, is what you should be telling your company.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.240]   Everything we're going to do is aiming us at these North Stars, so you know why we're
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.920]   doing it and what our goals are.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.360]   I'll give you a few sample North Stars, but I think this general approach is really important,
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.560]   because otherwise you could end up in that sort of must-taking-over-Twitter-in-2022 territory,
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:42.560]   which was more like, I am going to haphazardly do things and you don't know why.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.480]   Haphazardness can really be a problem, right?
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.400]   That really can be a problem, where it's like, I don't know why you're doing this or what's
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.000]   going on.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.840]   What then, what might these North Stars be?
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.720]   Well based on my books, I would mention three ideas you could start with.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.460]   One, North Star number one, context switching is productivity poison.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.720]   This is the thing we're really worried about.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:11.080]   We are willing to go to a pretty extreme extent to try to minimize the times during a typical
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.940]   day where you have to switch your cognitive context from one target to another, because
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.720]   we know every time we do that, there's this huge cognitive cost.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.560]   We're basically siphoning cognitive fuel out of your brain, and there's only so many times
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.340]   we can siphon it before you're just burnt out and can't do anything else for the day.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.040]   That's what we want to try to minimize, is cognitive context switches.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.940]   I would emphasize here, this is very different than what other people implicitly try to optimize
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:41.400]   or minimize, which tends to be things like friction or response time, or they try to
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   maximize the velocity of information.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.080]   You say, no, this is a business run on brains.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.960]   We want our brains to run well.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.120]   We're spending a lot of money on these brains.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.400]   Contact shifts is putting sand in the gears.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.080]   Priority one, how do we rethink about how we do work and communicate, etc., to minimize
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.480]   contact shifts.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.840]   North star number two, I would suggest, make it very clear, deep work on things that move
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.320]   the needle, that is bring in new revenue.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.080]   That's the priority.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:19.440]   We're going to make changes, bend, transform how we do things, whatever is needed to protect
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.340]   that priority.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.960]   This is what we're going to measure.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.680]   This is what we are going to reward.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.920]   This is what we are going to defer to, even if deferring to this makes other parts of
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.740]   our lives less convenient.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.360]   Even if deferring to this means the HR department has a much harder time getting the information
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.920]   they need for payroll because they can't just blast email everyone and say answer in six
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.720]   hours with this information so we can fill out these charts and it's going to make our
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.120]   job in the HR department much easier.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.400]   Our goal is not to make the lives of the HR department as easy as possible.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.160]   It's to produce aerospace products that make money.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.320]   So if someone is doing that, we're going to let them cook, to reference our episode from
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.800]   a couple weeks back about let Brandon cook, our reference to Brandon Sanderson.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   This is what matters.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   We protect it.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.680]   So if you're able to prove to me, I am producing something with my brain that is directly valuable,
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.720]   but in order to do this, you have to stop.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.480]   I can't go to these meetings people keep sending me or I need to take these things off my plate.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:22.080]   If you can make a case, this is going to produce more cognitive output that is directly valuable.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.200]   I will listen to that case.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.480]   I will always listen to that case.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.440]   You got to come back to what ultimately actually makes the difference.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:33.280]   As soon as we lose sight of that, we are going to end up in a productivity thunderdome where
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.520]   everyone is just trying to optimize their own lives, make their own lives easier, and
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   that's not our business.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.880]   We're in the business of making aerospace and the stuff that matters matters, meritocracy
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   in that way.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.760]   North Star number three, no more pseudo productivity.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.840]   Visible activity is meaningless to me.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.840]   Results matter.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.840]   What are you working on?
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   Did it go well?
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   Good.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.840]   What are you going to work on next?
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.120]   To this end, teams should be tracking work in a more transparent fashion so that no one
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.080]   gets overloaded.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.040]   Teams should have, like I talk about a lot in my book, Slow Productivity, here's the
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.800]   things we are working on.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.760]   Here's the things we need to work on.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.940]   We have a whole list, and it doesn't exist distributed haphazardly through different
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.600]   team members' email inboxes.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.240]   It is on this digital board or this physical bulletin board, a card for everything that
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.420]   we need to do.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.920]   Over here, we're tracking who's working on what right now, and you can only have so many
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.140]   cards under your name, like one or two, maybe that's it.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.320]   We don't take all these things we need to do and just sort of spread them around everyone's
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.120]   plate and just start talking to each other all the time about all of these things.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   "Hey, what about this?
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   What about that?"
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.720]   That puts us back to our first north star that violates minimized context shifting.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.080]   It also violates our second north star, prioritize deep work on the stuff that really matters.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.240]   So why don't we track work carefully so that no one gets overloaded?
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.560]   You're not allowed to work on 10 things.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   Work on two things.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   Do those things well.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   I don't want to overload you.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.040]   If I give you 10 things, you're going to have to have meetings and emails about all 10 of
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.000]   those things, which means most of your day will be having meetings and emails, which
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.440]   means when are you doing the deep work on the stuff that really moves the needle?
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.880]   That's no good.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:12.840]   So let's track at the team scale workloads in a transparent fashion so no one has to
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.600]   take on too much and we can allow people to be more efficient.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.560]   This in turn will allow you to structure communication because now you can check in on this.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.640]   You can have daily standups at the team scale.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.800]   Okay, who's working on what?
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   I know that actually.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   It's on the board.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   What do you need to get this done?
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   All right.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.920]   You've been working on this since Monday.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   What is the roadblock?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.000]   "Oh, you need this information.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.040]   You need this information from, you know, Bob.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.880]   You're right here in the daily standup."
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   When can you get that information over to Cal?
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.640]   You can get it, okay, by 11.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.120]   Get it to him by 11.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.120]   We all agree on this?
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   Great.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.280]   And then you're going to work on this for the four hours after that you're going to
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   get that done?
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   Great.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   Now just go work.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.440]   Don't look at your inbox.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.160]   Go work.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.400]   So those would be my three north stars if I was taking over a 100-person company.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.080]   Make it clear that context shifting is productivity poison.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.120]   Make it clear that the number one thing we care about is cognitive efforts to produce
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.640]   things that directly move the needle.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.520]   Everything else is going to revolve around making that better and doing more of that.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.520]   That is our north star.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.520]   It's what we care about.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   And three, no more pseudoproductivity.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:15.120]   We're going to track work carefully so that no one gets overloaded and so that we can
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.960]   make sure people have what they need with a minimum of unnecessary activity.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.480]   And if you're moving things from your column to the done column, I don't care about anything
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   else.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   I don't care about how fast you answer emails.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.440]   I don't care about how many Zoom meetings you're in.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.440]   Productivity versus pseudoproductivity.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.440]   So that's what I would do.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   All right.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.360]   What do we got next?
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.840]   We have our corner.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.240]   Ooh, slow productivity corner.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.080]   This last one could have been a part of the corner a little bit, too.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.920]   So slow productivity corner, we specifically highlight a question that's related to my
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.720]   book, Slow Productivity.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.280]   We want to highlight at least one question each week that is related to that.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.080]   Wow, we're running out of time on that, though, Jesse.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.720]   We said one year, right?
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   When did my book come out?
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   Pretty early in March last year.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.960]   I think it was like March 5th.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   Uh-oh.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.920]   This could be the last one.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.760]   Technically, this would be the last episode with a slow productivity corner.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.700]   So go buy the book, Slow Productivity.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.800]   We'll find a reason to play this theme music.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.280]   We'll find a reason.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.200]   All right.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.920]   What's our slow productivity corner question of the week?
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   All right.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   It's from Daniel.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.040]   Are there perceived benefits of pseudoproductivity in the workplace?
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.520]   At my company, being responsive at all times on email and instant messaging leads someone
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.120]   to being seen as dedicated to work and visible to leaders, which leads to advancement.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.960]   How do I advance if I don't do this?
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:40.120]   Well, yeah, I mean, this is the dangerous nature of pseudoproductivity, is that as long
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.760]   as this becomes the implicit heuristic by which your company measures value, it's hard
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   to escape.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.880]   So again, we talked about in the last question, but just to reemphasize, pseudoproductivity
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.380]   is using visible activity as a proxy for useful effort.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.120]   So the more visibly active you are, the more useful you will be assumed to be.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.920]   In a digital world, this is a problem because mobile computing means you can be demonstrating
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.720]   effort at any location at any time, and mobile communications like email and Slack means
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.740]   you can be demonstrating effort at this incredibly fine granularity, at the granularity of like
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.320]   answering individual emails, being involved in back and forth conversations.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.880]   So it leads to a sort of overload of work.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.960]   You work too many hours, and it leads to a style of work that is very draining and doesn't
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.580]   produce much that's actually valuable.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.580]   I hate pseudoproductivity.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:31.280]   I think it is a cancer on employee well-being in the knowledge sector.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.760]   It's why I wrote the book Slow Productivity to say, do this instead.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.240]   Part one, here's why this is bad.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.920]   Part two, do this instead.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   First of all, just recognize the problem.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:48.000]   All right, so what can you do if you are in an organization that still worships at the
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.120]   altar of pseudoproductivity?
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:55.680]   Well, most of the advice in my book is geared at least in part towards this situation.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.040]   You're behind enemy lines, and you're trying to make your way towards safety.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.120]   So there are still things you can do.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.720]   One is trade clarity for responsiveness.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.600]   Be really clear what you're working on, its status, when it's going to get done, and deliver
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.200]   it when you say you're going to deliver it.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:20.560]   If you're trusted, if you have this clarity, the need for you to be responsive goes down.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.800]   Because why do people want answers typically right away to messages?
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   It's because they don't know what's going on.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.200]   They have an open loop in their head, "Oh, yeah, this project, I forgot about that.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.600]   What is Jesse up to with that?"
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.360]   It's just an open loop in their head, and until you respond, they have to keep track
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.360]   of it, and it's a source of stress.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.640]   But if you have some other system, they could be like, "Oh, no, Jesse's on the ball."
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.240]   You're like, "Yep, I'm working on it.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.760]   It's in position five in my queue.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   Here's what it is.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.200]   I think I should have it done by Tuesday, and I'll tell you if that's going to shift."
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.680]   And they trust if they don't hear from you it's going to come on Tuesday, they don't
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   have to worry about it.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.400]   So a lot of responsiveness is driven from uncertainty.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.640]   So if you're very clear, you can reduce the demands of responsiveness.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:06.520]   Two, it's a big thing in the book, you have to have some way of limiting concurrent workload.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.960]   The kiss of death in pseudoproductivity is working on too many things at the same time
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.280]   because everything you're working on brings with it its own administrative overhead.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:20.560]   So if you're working on too many things, that administrative overhead aggregates until most
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   of your schedule is servicing tasks instead of actually completing them, and that's this
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   terrible state where almost nothing gets done, and it's incredibly stressful.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.120]   So how do you do that?
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   Well, one thing you can do is distinguish between, "Here's what I'm actively working
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.560]   on, and here's what I'm waiting to work on," of the things I've accepted.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   Active waiting.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.040]   I do email meetings about the stuff I'm actively worked on, not on the stuff I'm waiting to
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.720]   work on, and I make this transparent and clear, it's in a shared document, I'll send a link
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   right to you.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.280]   "Oh, you want to have a meeting to talk about it?
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   Here's my queue.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.600]   It's still in the waiting part.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.440]   It's in position three.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.240]   You know, it should get there in about a week or so.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.960]   I'll email it as soon as it gets to active, and then we'll talk about it all day if you
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   want.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.640]   But I can only be actually working on a few number of things at a time."
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.280]   That sort of clarity works.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.680]   Also if you have some flexibility on what you can say yes and no to, so the problem
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.440]   is just not yourself wanting to say no to too much, use quotas, "Yeah, I do this type
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.040]   of thing, but only this many per quarter."
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.800]   And when your quota is filled, say, "Yeah, of course, typically I would like to have
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.280]   a mentoring lunch, or jump on this call, or come to this committee meeting, but I've already
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.840]   passed my quota for this quarter, or for this month, or for this week, so I can't do it
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   this time."
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.560]   It's a very reasonable way to moderate activities that are important, so that you're still doing
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.960]   things that are important, but not doing too many.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.060]   There's a bunch of other ideas like that that are in the book, but those are the two big
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.920]   picture things to think about, trading clarity for responsiveness and finding ways to manage
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.400]   your concurrent workload.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.360]   You do those two things, you'll be better.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.600]   Above all else, just get really good at things that matter.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.120]   That's principle three of my books, obsess over quality.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.480]   If you're doing something that's valuable, they do not want to lose you.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:04.500]   I'll just make this final point, because I think a lot of people have an overly character
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:11.520]   charred, antagonistic mental image of their employer or boss, and they really do see their
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:19.240]   employer or boss like a Bond villain, who is somehow converting rapid email responses
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.680]   into fuel for a laser that they're going to use to destroy the world.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.680]   That's what they care about.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.960]   This thing that really makes you miserable, they're twisting their mustache and they have
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.760]   a cat that they're petting, and it's like, "We need you to be answering emails is what's
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:38.560]   important because we use those quick responses in my volcano layer to fuel my laser."
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.720]   The reality is, it's really hard to hire good people.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.720]   They worry about people leaving.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.720]   They don't have enough people.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.440]   If you're doing something valuable, you're really good at something that the company
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.440]   needs.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.200]   You know what they're staying up late at night thinking about?
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.400]   Not, "Hey, how quickly is he responding to my emails?"
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.920]   They're thinking, "Oh my God, what if he leaves?"
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.700]   You got to recognize, make yourself valuable.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.200]   Don't be a jerk about it, but recognize you have value.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.400]   You don't have to make a big manifesto or a big autoresponder, but I work differently.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.400]   You know why?
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.280]   Because I deliver.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.200]   I produce this code that's awesome.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.960]   I organize these events that kill.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:18.400]   I put together these marketing campaigns that have the highest ROI of my entire team.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.080]   Yeah, I do this Cal Newport stuff that's a little bit weird.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.840]   My project queue, you hear from me within 24 hours, but not within 24 minutes when you
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   email me.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.280]   And I'm responsible, but I'm a little bit off kilter and I say no to a lot more things.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.080]   But if I go, you're going to lose that ROI.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.340]   You do not want that person to go, so you kind of put up with it.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.340]   So remember that.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.320]   If you're doing something valuable, you are really needed.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.400]   You are really wanted, right?
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:52.120]   I mean, unless, again, you're under the supervision of Elon Musk and the Department of Government
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:57.760]   Efficiency, if you're at an actual company with an actual boss who doesn't walk around
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.240]   holding chainsaws, they are desperately afraid of losing good people.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   So be good.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.720]   And you get a lot more flexibility as well.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.720]   All right.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.120]   Do we have a call this week?
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   We do.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.120]   All right.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   Let's hear it.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   Hi, Cal.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:18.520]   My name is Joe and the majority of my work centers around optimizing websites for clients.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.080]   My job is remote, flexible, and I have a lot of autonomy.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.480]   However, my responsibilities aren't clearly defined since I'm on a very small team.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:32.760]   This has sort of led me to a cycle of reacting to urgent tasks, putting in a lot of work,
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.640]   and then taking work easier for a while until something urgent comes up again.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.160]   This has left me either overwhelmed and tired some days or feeling bad that I haven't done
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.480]   enough for most others.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:48.380]   I'd love to strike a balance between client work and working on company goals while also
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:54.240]   leveraging the sort of flexibility and autonomy at work so I can work on my personal projects
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:00.320]   like content creation while not quite going full quiet quit mode.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:04.340]   While struggling with motivation is definitely one of my problems here, one of the other
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:10.680]   thorns in my side has been struggling to define what enough means for a work day or a work
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.800]   week.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:17.000]   For people with more autonomous or flexible roles or even just business owners in general,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.760]   how do you recommend going about defining what it means to have worked enough?
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   Thanks.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.640]   All right, we've got a couple things going on here.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.180]   Let's get to your job situation in particular.
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:34.360]   I think you need to think about your job as really being two different jobs.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.560]   The first job is client responsiveness, right?
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:44.880]   Your first job is working with clients with their issues or requests and satisfying them.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.360]   Then you have the second part of your job, which is self-initiated, less monitored, and
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.960]   less deadline.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.560]   Let's just call that part B because what that is could depend, but you sort of have to think
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.240]   of it as like the self-initiated part of your job and you have the client responsiveness
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.320]   part of your job.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   Let's look at both of these.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.720]   Let's do some work on both of these and then I want to talk about overall this question
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.040]   of how much work is enough, how do I know if I'm working enough.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.680]   I would look at the client piece first and even though it's reasonable, right?
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.800]   You're saying it's only sometimes there's issues that I have to deal with.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.280]   I would say, how do I make this piece as sustainable as possible, right?
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.880]   Let's do some optimization over there and maybe this is about how do I stop crisises
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:31.400]   from occurring as much as they do or how do I have, more importantly, maybe a way of dealing
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:39.800]   with crisises that is reassuring to the client and moves us away from just constant immediate
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.680]   responsive communication, right?
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.060]   In the lack of structure, if you run like a website dev company and there's a problem
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.440]   that a client has had, with a lack of structure for like, here's how we stay in touch and
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.160]   here's how we deal with crises, what it's going to be is like, answer my call, answer
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.760]   my call, answer my call, like this is now a big source of stress for me and I don't
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.960]   know what's happening until you finally like tell me what's going on.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:01.160]   So you might want to work on that a little bit like, here's our crisis response, you
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:08.720]   know, we have crisis@webdevelopmentcompany.com, you send in that email, like we will be on
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.600]   it within two hours, we have a daily setup call, I don't know.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.680]   I don't want to give you the details, but find a way to make sure that's not too stressful
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   or draining.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.840]   All right, all the other days you're working on part B of your job and here you have a
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.760]   choice.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:27.960]   You can either do a phantom part-time job, this is our word for I have like a consistent
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:32.800]   amount of sort of unstructured time that I'm going to structure for another goal, something
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.880]   that's really important to me that I'm working on and it could be building up a technical
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.480]   skill or something that might eventually become a side business or it could be a self-education
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.160]   project or something completely unrelated, community related, unrelated to your professional
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   job.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.080]   So you could do that.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:54.160]   Or as you suggest, build in a more sort of self-initiated sort of value-growing project
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.960]   within your company.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.520]   Like I also do this, which is going to have value within the company.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:03.200]   So you have to make that decision.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:09.040]   There's something to be said for if you like the general company and the client stuff's
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:15.360]   a little bit stressful, you have this flexibility where you could start building a secondary
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.720]   pursuit within your company that you're initiating that you want to become so good you can't
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.720]   be ignored on eventually, but there's no actual pressure or deadlines or close monitoring
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.800]   in the short term with the idea of if I keep getting better at this, I can spend less time
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.480]   doing the client stuff and more time doing what I want to do.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.040]   So you can have a vision of like, what do I want my job at this company in an ideal
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.440]   world to be like and start working your way towards there with this extra time.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.320]   That might not be a bad way of thinking about it.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.100]   Oh, I have a vision for what I could be doing here.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.100]   You know, I don't know.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.360]   Maybe it's building back-end tools that not only helps the company, but then the company
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.880]   can license and sell to other people and you're just on your own doing dev and no one really
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.840]   knows what you're doing in a particular day, but you're kind of pulling out cool tools
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.840]   or something like that.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.760]   That's an example of something you could do within your company that makes you really
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   valuable.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.840]   You could point to the money you're bringing in the door, like we're much better because
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.480]   of this and you made 500K selling licenses for this last year.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.600]   So like, obviously my salary is justified, but it's entirely autonomous and there are
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.600]   no crisis days.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   Right.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.800]   So something like that might not be a bad idea.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.560]   I don't want to discourage you from spending this time on a content creation related phantom
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.200]   part-time job, but I will say the content creation world is really hard.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.960]   I think you'd say that's probably true, right, Jesse?
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.960]   Like we work pretty hard at this and I have 20 years of writing books that helps.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:38.000]   I mean it's a tough, that's a tough world and there are traps there.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.080]   There's a lot of, a lot of this world right now is this thin stream of people making a
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:48.120]   good living and then a lot of people that they're, they're saying they can use similar
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.360]   tools and kind of feel like you're in this world.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.800]   You have like a sub stack or you're used to be like you're posting your medium post or
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:58.000]   you're doing your threads on X that are in the exact same format and at the end of this
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.720]   last one you say, if you want to find out more, sign up here, but a lot of that's just
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.440]   like getting people to churn and be online and be monetized.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.040]   Like you're not making money, you're being monetized.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.160]   So be careful about it.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:12.320]   Content creation is a rough world, but you know, whatever, you do you with that.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:17.240]   The final question then, regardless of how you choose to do through A and B, is how should
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.280]   you feel about, you know, guilt or non-guilt?
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.040]   Look, here's the thing, if you're not defrauding your company, if you are doing what they're
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:27.160]   asking you to do and you're doing a good job at it and they're happy with you and they're
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:32.560]   actually giving you a check that has money in it and that money is enough, the market
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.640]   is saying you are working enough as far as that employer is concerned.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   Right?
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:44.720]   Again, this pseudo-productive culture, pseudo-productivity culture, the thing I invade against in my
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.000]   book Slow Productivity.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.640]   Pseudo-productivity culture says activity is what is valuable and this arbitrary amount
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.040]   of activity, which should be like 40 hours, but really like 40 plus, like you should have
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:00.880]   a couple of late days, somehow that amount of activity means you're worthwhile and anything
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   less than that means you're not.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.920]   Which is crazy because if you look at any sort of kind of classical value creation figure
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.740]   from history, there's all sorts of different amounts of times they're working and it's
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.740]   not 40 hours.
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:14.560]   40 hours a week is just what the labor unions compromised with, with the factory owners
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.640]   for like how long can we get someone to stay on an assembly line and put steering wheels
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.960]   on Model T's before they begin to bleed out of the eyes.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.960]   Right?
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.460]   And they're like, well, the factory owners are like, can't you just do this for 80 hours?
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.460]   And the unions were like, I think people will die on their feet and like, all right, I guess
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.460]   40.
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.460]   Right?
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.280]   It has nothing to do with like web development.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.240]   It's no magic when it comes to what's the right amount of time to be a writer, to be
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.800]   doing marketing campaigns or to be working on software dev.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.520]   So what matters is, is your employer happy?
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   Are you making money?
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.520]   Are people paying you?
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.640]   I mean, money is a neutral indicator of value.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.120]   Are they paying you a good living for what you're doing?
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.560]   And there's no deceit, right?
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   You're not tricking them.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.560]   You're not tricking them.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.520]   Like I making them think you did something, you didn't.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.520]   They know what you're doing.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.520]   We have these clients, these clients are being handled.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.520]   The clients are happy.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.560]   Here's your paycheck.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.400]   That is a free exchange in a capitalist market.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.960]   Your labor is being valued there.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:08.040]   And it's, you know, one of the cool things about these sort of more entrepreneurial knowledge,
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:13.200]   sort of remote work, knowledge, work markets is that like the market, it will try to value
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   you properly.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.920]   And it's possible that like, yeah, this job is taking 15 hours a week and I'm making a
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.920]   good living off it.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.760]   That's not a problem.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.800]   That just means you're doing something high value for this particular company.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.240]   You're bringing skills to the table and it's worth that much money to them.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.900]   So I wouldn't worry about that.
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:32.160]   If they're unhappy with you, you're not working enough, right?
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.920]   That's what you should, but they're happy with you.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   You're working enough.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.120]   Now you're saying, how do I, now what do I want to do with my job?
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.360]   What do I want to do with my surplus time?
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.040]   So that's the way I would think about that.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   All right.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.600]   We have a case study here.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.160]   This is where people send in their accounts of applying the type of advice we talked about
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.040]   on the show to their own lives so we can see what it looks like in practice.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:57.540]   Today's case study comes from Ariel who says, I worked my butt off in grad school and landed
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.300]   what I thought was a dream job in biotech.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:05.200]   As these things go, the dream job, I'm putting this in scare quotes, is turning into a career
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:09.860]   with many flaws and limited growth potential, but I've really been able to improve my productivity
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.660]   per unit time.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:16.560]   To achieve what I used to accomplish in about 60 hours of, again, scare quotes, work, showing
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:21.080]   up at an office for six days a week has turned into about 10 hours of focused work that is
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.200]   very flexible plus 12 hours of meetings.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.600]   I use many of the tools you talk about as a means to be very productive, but work far
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.400]   less than I used to.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.360]   But the workaholic thoughts are a daily struggle.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.580]   Anytime I have some free time, I think things like, hey, maybe I should start a science
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.480]   sub stack in my specialty.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.440]   Maybe I should write some fiction.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.440]   Shouldn't I be busier?
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:45.080]   I would love to be at peace with consuming great books and movies, but the drive to create
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:46.760]   is pretty relentless.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:51.160]   I am torn between creating things in my free time that may benefit my career or turn into
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:55.520]   a new one or maintaining this fairly stress-free lifestyle while it lasts.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.400]   My question is simply why can't knowledge workers be happy just doing less?
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:03.240]   If we have the means and the drive, should we all just start creating content in hopes
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.040]   that people will consume it?
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   All right.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.440]   Well, interesting case study.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:13.960]   I want to really, before we get to the meat of Ariel's embedded question, let's get to
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.880]   the meat of what happened here that I think is really telling.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.720]   He was working 60 hours a week.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:25.640]   And when he stepped back and said, what actually creates value?
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.960]   And let me focus on that and be careful about my time.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.640]   He reduced that to 10 hours of deep work and then 12 hours of performative meetings.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.480]   This is true of a lot of jobs.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:40.240]   Pseudoproductivity is different than actual productivity.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:46.440]   Actual activity is a low risk, highly replicatable way of trying to trick people into thinking
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   that you're valuable.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:53.640]   But again, it is just rarely the case that actual value production requires roughly 40
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.640]   to 60 hours a week.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.640]   That's like an arbitrary number.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.520]   So I think this is really telling that in 10 hours of actual work, he did all the stuff
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.260]   he used to do in 60.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.740]   That's what happens when you move from pseudoproductivity to actual value production.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.120]   The workaholic question is an interesting one.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.960]   I'm actually going to point towards the future.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:16.680]   If all things go well, I believe I have an in-depth episode coming out on Thursday of
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:22.520]   this week, which is a conversation on exactly this question, this question of the pursuit
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.520]   of greatness.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.820]   Is this a problem?
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.080]   Why does it make us uncomfortable?
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.320]   Why does it also motivate us?
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.720]   How do we navigate the conflicting constraints and the conflicting demands of trying to be
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.760]   really good?
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.320]   We get into that in the upcoming in-depth episode.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.200]   So listen to that.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:47.860]   My short take on this, though, is it usually helps—so in this situation, if you're doing
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:52.940]   something good, you like your work, you think it's important what you're doing, it usually
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.640]   helps if you are doing some lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.480]   So what you're working towards with your time in your life is making your lifestyle closer
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.420]   to things that resonate and away from things that don't.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.420]   That might be professional.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.480]   It might be like, "Okay, once I've done lifestyle-centric planning, I really need to get to this point
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   in my job.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.440]   So I'm building up a new skill specifically because that'll allow me to move from the
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.200]   headquarters and work remotely out of Maine because I want to live by blah, blah, blah."
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.880]   Or it could be completely unrelated to your job.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.360]   It gives you a real effort for a real purpose for energy that you're investing outside of
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.460]   your job, whatever it is, like with your kids or your health or something else that's going
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.060]   on.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:37.920]   Lifestyle-centric planning is going to give you a direction for these efforts, so it's
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.400]   not just, "Maybe I'm just reading a lot of big books or maybe I'm just trying to do more
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.400]   work at my job."
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.200]   It gives you a reason for why you're doing that.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.000]   You have a particular target you're trying to go to.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.440]   So I think that might be helpful.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.440]   But also, it is okay to just have some seasonality and like, "My job's not that hard right now.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.320]   It's kind of nice.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.760]   I don't know.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.240]   I'm exercising a lot.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.960]   I spend a lot more time with my kids.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.640]   I'm like involved with a—yeah, I'm writing a fiction writing group just for fun, no stakes.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640]   Something to do."
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.960]   That's not the worst thing either.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.320]   I really think slow productivity, the book Slow Productivity, is perfectly timed for
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.120]   what you're going through now because it'll continue to have strategies to help you tighten
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   the strategies you're already doing to keep this job load small.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.600]   But the seasonality, you could really take advantage of the ideas of seasonality, the
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.960]   work at a natural pace principle, and the obsess over quality, like do something really
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.880]   well for more leverage, like that also is right where you are right now.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.720]   So I think that book is really going to resonate.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.960]   But I appreciate the case study, 60 hours down the 10 hours of focused work and 12 hours
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960]   of meetings.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.000]   And I bet in those 12 hours of meetings, 25 minutes of actual useful information, if I
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   had to guess.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.080]   All right, well, we got our final segment coming up where we'll talk about the books
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080]   I read.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.280]   But first, let's briefly hear from some more sponsors.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:57.560]   I want to talk about our friends at the Defender line of vehicles, the Defender 90, the Defender
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.760]   110, and the Defender 130.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:09.440]   This is a classic, iconic line of cars that have been reimagined to not only look fantastic,
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:18.000]   but to maintain the same sort of durability that they've had before, that sort of go anywhere
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.760]   durability they had before with the comfort of a modern vehicle.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.280]   I actually, this is true, Jesse, yesterday, I'm going to load this on my phone because
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   he's not going to believe me.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.920]   I'm going to turn out my phone here.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.920]   Our friend Brad Stolberg, who's like my partner in crime when it comes to Defender, sent me
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.120]   a picture from his neighbor.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.440]   Look at that.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:46.980]   So it's a Defender logo illuminated on the sidewalk next to Brad's house.
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.880]   His neighbors just bought a Defender.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:54.000]   And you can set the car that when it is parked to actually shine down the sort of Defender
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.040]   logo just sort of discreetly on the ground next to it.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.880]   I thought it was really cool.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.040]   I am assuming they bought that Defender because they heard me say they should.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.400]   But it's a really cool, these cars are everywhere.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.720]   Last time we did a read for the Defender, we saw one right outside the HQ.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.800]   We're doing a read for the Defender today, and Brad sends me a photo of his neighbor's
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   just got one.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   I don't know.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   It's a really cool car, but you can check it out.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:21.480]   If you haven't seen one, go to LandRoverUSA.com, and you can see what these cars look like.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.120]   It's an iconic car that's been updated with all of the modern conveniences, drives great
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   on road and off.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.160]   It's kind of like the official car of the Deep Questions podcast right now.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.880]   Check that out, LandRoverUSA.com.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.360]   You can explore the full Defender lineup when you go to LandRoverUSA.com.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.120]   I also want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:51.280]   Look, if you are going to be selling things online or in a store, you have goods you're
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.360]   going to exchange for money, you got to be thinking about Shopify.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:01.040]   But the thing that anyone who is in the online space like we are knows is this is what people
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.040]   use when they want to start selling something.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   They go to Shopify.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.880]   It makes it very easy to set up.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.920]   You get this sort of best-in-class tech.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.560]   The conversion rate on sales is high.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.000]   The experience is fantastic.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.240]   It makes everything simple.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.800]   People who set up physical stores, they use Shopify point-of-service systems.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.120]   It all just works really well.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:26.280]   It's basically almost like a shorthand in our world, our online world.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.760]   It's like, "Yeah, I'm going to start selling these shirts or coins or whatever.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.080]   Yeah, I'm going to Shopify it."
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:39.540]   It is the technology that people that we know who sell things, it is the technology that
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:40.540]   they use.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.720]   Statistically, they're the number one checkout on the planet.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:49.600]   Their shop pay feature, so this is what happens when you're checking out.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:54.560]   Sales conversions up to 50%, meaning that way less sharp carts go abandoned and way
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.640]   more sales get going.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.600]   If you're growing your business, your commerce platform better be ready to sell wherever
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.040]   your customers are scrolling or strolling on the web in your store and their feed and
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.640]   everywhere in between.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.480]   You need Shopify businesses that sell more sell on Shopify.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.160]   Upgrade your business and get the same checkout that basically everyone I know who sells things
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.500]   uses.
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:23.680]   You can sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep, but you have to type
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680]   that in all lowercase.

[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   All right, let's get on, Jesse, to our final segment.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.900]   All right, this is our first episode of March, so I'm going to talk about the books I read
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.960]   in the short month of February 2025.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.720]   The first book I read was Moral Ambition by Rutger Bregman.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.320]   A couple of people have been talking to me about Rutger.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.080]   He's, I believe, Danish, maybe?
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.080]   Danish philosopher?
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.840]   He's had a couple of books that have really raised some eyebrows, young guy.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.680]   I like the idea of this book, Moral Ambition.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.880]   It was basically a call to use your skills to go do things that are useful for the world.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.400]   I don't know if it's out yet or not.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.080]   I actually read this in galley form.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.440]   I was given a blurb for it, but I enjoyed it.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:17.760]   I actually read it very closely, and so I'm including it then on this list.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.000]   I admire the ambition of the book, Moral Ambition.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.040]   It's sort of nice to have someone say, "Hey, smart person.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.840]   Maybe your whole life shouldn't be centered on how do I make the most money in private
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.840]   equity or something.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.840]   Go do things that are good."
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.600]   I like when people challenge people to stand up, do more.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   It's an interesting book.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.720]   I like the program that Bregman has going on over there.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   Then I read a thriller.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.440]   You've got to have some thrillers.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.600]   The thriller I read was Brotherhood of the Rose by David Morrell.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:53.720]   David Morrell is a big thriller writer from the '70s and '80s in particular, maybe best
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.960]   known for Rambo First Blood.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.600]   It was First Blood that became the first Rambo movie, which was actually one of the very
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.280]   first modern form action movies.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.640]   I rewatched it a couple of years ago.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640]   It's worth watching.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   Actually, that's a very cool movie.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.200]   It's Sly Stallone, the first one.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:15.520]   The later Rambo movies is where he has the giant biceps and the headband and is firing
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.160]   exploding arrows.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.280]   The first movie was not like that.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:26.680]   It's at the tail end of the new Hollywood '70s, and it is a smaller movie.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:32.920]   The premise of the first Rambo movie is that he's a Vietnam vet who's suffering post-traumatic
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.280]   stress and walking through this small town where he's being hassled by the sheriff, like,
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   "Hey, hippie.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280]   Get out of here."
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:46.480]   He's really struggling, so he's unresponsive, and he cracks.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.640]   All of this training that he had as a special forces guy in Vietnam all comes out.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.480]   He goes back in autopilot and breaks someone's nose and stabs the other and flees into the
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.480]   woods.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.960]   They're going after there to catch him.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.160]   It was a book about war and its effects and its after effects, and the book has this real
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.240]   tragic ending.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.200]   The movie is cool, though, because of the famous scene where the colonel who trained
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:16.400]   Rambo comes to where they're trying to find him in the forest.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.040]   I think it's Brian Dennehy who plays the police chief.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.520]   The police chief is like, "Colonel, we don't need you here.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   We get it.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   You're worried about your man.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.680]   You don't want him to get hurt, but he killed one of us.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.680]   We're going to go get him."
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.320]   The colonel says, "I don't think you understand.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.600]   I'm not here to save Rambo from you.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.080]   I'm here to save you from Rambo."
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.760]   It's this kind of classic line, and he does kill a lot of them.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.440]   Different book by David Murrell.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.000]   Another classic one, Brotherhood of the Rose, is about these two orphans that have been
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.760]   trained by the CIA to be assassins, and then they're kind of turning on them and trying
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.280]   to kill them off to make them scapegoats, and they're being chased.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   Classic thriller.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.120]   I thought it was really good.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.280]   I was hearing about Murrell from Jack Carr, the ex-Navy SEAL novelist who wrote Terminalist
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   series of books.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.400]   He always talked about David Murrell, was a real inspiration for him, and so I had fun
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   with it.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.520]   Then I read How Dante Can Save Your Life by Rod Dreher.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:22.640]   It's an account of Rod Dreher going through a tough period in his life, and Dante's, reading
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:30.320]   Dante, the Inferno, Paradiso, and I forgot the one in the middle, but the whole belcanto,
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320]   the Grand Comedia.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   What do they call it?
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   The Comedia?
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320]   Comedia?
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320]   The Grand?
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.440]   I don't know what the right name is for the three books of Dante.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.440]   Look that up.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.880]   Oh, well, yeah, I'm getting that wrong, and I read a whole book about it, but basically
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.800]   he reads Dante, and it brings him out of this funk that he's in, and so there's some cool
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.040]   history of Dante, and then the lessons he drew out of it.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.000]   There's also some memoir going on.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.080]   He moves back to a small town in Louisiana where he grew up, and things don't go well,
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.200]   and he has a psychological crisis that leads to a physical...
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.200]   Divine comedy?
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.200]   The divine comedy, yeah.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.080]   There's an Italian name for it, right?
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.880]   That's what I was trying to say, the Comedia, which is not how you say it, right?
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.520]   But I'm clearly a Dante scholar.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.200]   I haven't read the full Divine Comedy, but I have a pretty good translation.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.200]   The Penguin...
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200]   La Divina Comedia.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.120]   Yeah, that's what I was thinking about, La Divina Comedia.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.120]   So it's pretty good.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.880]   I don't, I mean, honestly, this is probably not fair.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.560]   I'm not the right person to read memoirs.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.600]   I just, you know, Dreher came across as somewhat self, as the reader, he feels sort of self-absorbed,
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.680]   which I guess is just what happens in a memoir, but like his whole life was just centered
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:48.240]   in this period on like, I can't get past that, like, my family is slighting me or disapproving
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   of me or whatever.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.080]   And at some point you're reading the book and you're like, man, get over it.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.760]   There's a little bit of that going on, which is not fair.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.280]   But anyways, he ends up okay.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   All right.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.520]   I also read Buzzsaw by Jesse Daugherty.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.960]   This is the, Jesse Daugherty was the beat reporter for the Nationals in 2019, and this
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.440]   was the book he wrote about the Nationals winning the World Series.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.840]   And I went to see him speak at the, there's a new bookstore in Bethesda.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.440]   So I went to see him speak and Andrew Golden and Spencer Nussbaum were there, they're the
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.800]   current beat reporters for the Nationals.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.600]   And it was kind of cool to have like a lot of baseball fans get together and just sort
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.880]   of talk about it.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:31.600]   And I felt bad for him because his book, Buzzsaw, came out March, 2020.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.960]   This was the only book event he has done for that book is in February, 2025.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.040]   So I was like, this is the only event you got, but he had a full house.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.240]   So I felt, I felt really good about it.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240]   So I read the book.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   It was great.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.760]   I was like, oh man, memory lane, like remembering that season and his style of writing the book
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.280]   as he explained it is like, there's a, this is his editor at Simon & Schuster told him
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.000]   this, your book's on a highway that's getting towards them winning, right?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.160]   You're going through the season, but you're going to have off ramps along the way where
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.120]   we get backstories of like, oh, like how did this player come into this system or where,
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.960]   what's the backstory on this like head of scouting.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:06.000]   So you got all these like side stories about the Nationals as well as you had the through
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   line of the season.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   And it was a lot of fun.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.240]   It was, it was a better than I thought it would be.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.320]   Jesse's a really good writer.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.720]   Finally I read Chris Hayes' new book, The Siren's Call.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.720]   This is his big new split.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.200]   Chris Hayes from MSNBC is big new splashy book about attention, the attention economy.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.240]   This book didn't necessarily have like a big new thesis.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.240]   It's doing well.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240]   It debuted at number one.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.120]   Like Chris is pretty famous and he was on all the shows.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.880]   It doesn't have like a big new splashy thesis, but it's very smartly written.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.480]   It's just like a smart idea book.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:38.400]   There's no advice in it, but it's just let me try to understand.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.440]   And he's, he, his research assistants are busy.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.000]   There are a lot of things and examples they're citing.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.240]   And I thought it was like a really well written book.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.720]   Chris is a smart writer.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.360]   We talk about these issues a lot on this show.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.800]   If you want kind of like a smart cultural critic take on attention, the attention economy,
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800]   this was a good one.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800]   He's a good writer.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800]   All right.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.080]   So that's what I read.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.760]   What's this picture you've given me here, Jesse?
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.600]   It's a Sega Genesis game.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.080]   Oh, I didn't know we were going to talk about that.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.480]   I'm going to hold it up, hold it up to the camera.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:10.360]   It is a Sega, did a listener send this to us?
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.760]   It's a Sega Genesis game that has the title Sigma Insidious.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   Did we?
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760]   Okay.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.200]   So this is about us talking about both these terms.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.280]   Oh, I have, I have your text here.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   All right.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.680]   Here's what the listener said.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.040]   I was just listening to episode 331 of the Deep Questions podcast where the two words
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.480]   Sigma and Insidious have taken a prominent role, which made me think about how they perfectly
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.800]   align with the two central philosophies of the deep life.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   Putting these two words together, Sigma Insidious makes me think of an old RPG game where the
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.640]   hero has to fight the heroes of shallowness and distraction by accumulating career capital
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.120]   in order to live out and maintain his ever evolving ideal lifestyle.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.120]   I like that.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.880]   I love the Sega Genesis reference because that's like our childhood.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:55.200]   That's like 1994 to 1997 so that's definitely a deep cut.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.480]   I'm going to be honest though, I don't remember what Sigma means.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.560]   We talked about it, I guess.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560]   I don't remember what it means.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.520]   He describes it in the second paragraph if you want to read it.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.160]   Describes an individual who puts his energy into pursuit of real value rather than relying
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.160]   on empty flashiness.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160]   Oh, I like that.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   All right, man.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160]   Sigma.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.880]   It's like the big term with young kids.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   So it's good.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.880]   Did you know?
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   Cool.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   Did you know Ohio is like a negative term?
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.880]   Yes.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.620]   I learned it from my kids recently.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.160]   So Sigma is not Ohio.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   Right.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.720]   I still can't figure out if based is good or bad.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.720]   I hadn't heard of that.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   Based?
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.720]   It's a thing.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.720]   That's based.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.600]   That's the first I heard.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.600]   You're clearly not Sigma.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.600]   I know.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.720]   Guys, just so you know, Ohio.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.480]   A Sigma is no about based except for I don't know what it means.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.480]   All right.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.880]   Every 10 second interval that I'm talking about youth lingo is like a thousand listeners
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.760]   taking their AirPods off and throwing them.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.040]   So we should probably wrap it up there, but I appreciate that Sega Genesis reference.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   This was from Alex.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040]   Thank you for that.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   All right, everyone.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   Thanks for listening.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.960]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.180]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:09.840]   If you like today's episode, you might also like episode 339 titled Let Brandon Cook,
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.600]   which is about building a company around letting people do what they do best.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.800]   The brand there, of course, is a reference to the very same Brandon Sanderson I talked
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.160]   about in today's deep dive.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.160]   Check it out.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.160]   I think you'll like it.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:28.240]   Everything in our company is built around let Brandon cook and take away from Brandon
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.320]   anything that he doesn't have to think about.
