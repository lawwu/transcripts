[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   There are times that you are going to step into a on the mat or in a cage or in a ring
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.320]   With someone that you know who is better than what you are
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.540]   And that's where you have to rise to the occasion and you will have to impose
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.760]   Your will upon them. Yes. Now. I only believe in
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.680]   I always hear all these coaches. You gotta give me 110. You gotta give me 150
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.900]   That is
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.280]   bullshit
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.640]   There's only 100 and that's when you give your maximum effort and there's 101 when you went beyond your capabilities. Yes
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.680]   Who was
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.800]   The toughest guy you've ever faced in amateur wrestling
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.360]   Tell you right now. Uh, his name was uh, larry habiloff four-time world champion
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.040]   It wasn't russian. Yeah, it wasn't uh wasn't uh, I think he only won one or two at that point in time
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.520]   And I knew I was walking into a match
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.240]   That he's better than me
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   And I only have one thing that I can do to him is that I have to wear him out
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.920]   Because the moment I can wear him out
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.280]   I will be able to start scoring points. So so literally in the match
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.800]   I knew that I was going to be losing for how long at this match
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.320]   I did not know how I was going to be losing but he had me probably I don't know five six seven eight points to nothing
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.480]   Yes by the time
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.640]   Fatigue each time we went out of bounds. I'm the guy that's hustling back to center
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.580]   Referees and again, that's kind of that psychological aspect because the referee sees who's world champions kind of move a little slow back right there
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.020]   Getting on getting out of it
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.460]   And now i'm the first guy to advance across his match and I score the first point
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.020]   And it's firing the fuel into me then score the second point and they're getting closer and closer
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.580]   and the fact that I I tie him and then i'm ahead of him and just just
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.140]   Not only did I beat him once I beat him a couple times and the toughest one is to beat him
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:56.620]   In his own home country and his hometown in front of his people because you've heard the expression of being over
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.180]   You think I was being screwed over by points like this being in russia being in his hometown?
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.000]   I said that I didn't just beat him. I beat him and three referees
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.220]   Because you have your your main referee is on the mat and you have two side judges and half the time and the crowd
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.620]   Things are taking place. They don't even look because they don't want to acknowledge and have to score me points
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.100]   So that's what I said. I beat him. I beat him. I imposed my will upon him and I beat him because
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.720]   Technically could I beat him? Nope
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.240]   I imposed my will I rose to occasion. I gave 101
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.360]   percent you beat a man you couldn't beat exactly
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   You
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   You
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.860]   (soft music)
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.860]   You
