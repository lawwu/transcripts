[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:38.740]  , so, so there's, there's many ways. First, you need to be aware of the distance control. That's one of the things that was the best. To master the distance control, you need to master the footwork. To be always in balance and ready to explode. A lot of guys, they don't know how to manage distance control also because they don't have good footwork.

[00:07:49.440 --> 00:08:00.060]   What about on the ground, what's the difference between getting free or not? Well, there's a lot of difference. I believe in the jiu-jitsu, especially in the guard,
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:11.480]   obrig
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.180]   all the time.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.180]   So you are very close to you or I'm very far.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.180]   Can you try to get up?
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.180]   I'm very far.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.180]   Yeah, if I can't get up, no problem.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:11.180]   I'm using my leg to push you away or I can use the tip of my feet to adjust them.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.180]   So you need to be aware that I can't get you in there.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.180]   Yeah, so it's either very close or very far.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.180]   Put it on top.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.180]   On top, yeah.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:25.180]   So if I'm on top, the best position for me to be, ultimately, is not even mount,
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.180]   is to have a good position.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.180]   Okay.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:27.180]   The best position for me to be, ultimately, is not even mount, is to have a good position.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:27.180]   The best position for me to be, ultimately, is not even mount, is to have a good position.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.220]   And now, your back, left you to the floor from this position.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.220]   Because now you cannot hit me, I can hit you and I can either knock you out or commit you.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.220]   This is the worst.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.220]   Mount is the second best because I'm having a lot of control.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.220]   Mount and also with my knees under your armpits, the worst would be in your guard.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   So it's not as bad as it would be in a GT2 competition because I have the ground,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.220]   I can't even get up.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.220]   So I'm not even going to get up.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.220]   I'm not even going to get up.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   I'm not even going to get up.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   So I'm not even going to get up.

[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:50.880]   the adverse reaction. We got a lot of heart before we stopped. So I've always found that by sparring away the most important things and the two people get into a fight, skill little trumps everything else in terms of what's going to be in the outcome. Skill beats heart. Skill beats the opponent. That's not to say other things aren't relevant, but skill is more relevant. From what I understand, the proposed opponent is almost two years of being assisted. That's a big advantage.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:12:19.860]   So it will be an uphill battle. I will say however though, that he deeply impressed both George and myself with his overall ability to watch and study his very complete lead, his strength intelligence and see what is the crux of the problem, identifies what needs to be done, but I also believe that he's probably one of the craziest human beings on the planet.
