[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   I'm here training with George St. Pierre, probably the greatest fighter of all time
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.240]   and also one of the nicest guys of all time.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.320]   Not the nicest guy, not today.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.280]   Not today, next.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.240]   You came on the wrong thing, my friend.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.220]   He's breathing hard.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.940]   Yeah!
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.060]   Yeah!
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.200]   Yeah!
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.420]   Yeah!
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.940]   Yeah!
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:52.660]   Need a face shot?
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.320]   Yeah!
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.440]   Yeah!
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.020]   I'm not that old.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.540]   He dies, he dies.
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.560]   He dies, he dies.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:13.220]   Any advice?
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.060]   Well, it's actually pretty good.
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.800]   Standing position, I think,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.920]   sometimes you reach a little bit too much.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.300]   So, if you reach,
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.080]   reach out to me,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.160]   it's easy for me to take a good position
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.580]   or reach out to me,
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.540]   I can probably, like,
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240]   climb back on you.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.040]   So, what I would suggest is
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.800]   don't reach,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.600]   like, get closer with your feet
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300]   before you, you, uh,
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.220]   seek contact with me.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.860]   So, don't go here.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.820]   Go closer to each other's shoulder.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.040]   Yes.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   Let's go.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   Okay
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   Hmm
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   Hmm
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   Hmm
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   Hmm
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:35.040]   Hey
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   Hmm
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   Hmm
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040]   Hmm
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.040]   Hmm
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   Hmm
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   Hmm
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   Hmm
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   Hmm
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.040]   Hey
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   Hey
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   So how is it different if you're doing MMA?
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   Well there's a lot of difference because
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   in uh
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.040]   in grappling
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040]   you set up for example
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   when you're fighting
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   In MMA
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   there's different styles
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   I like to be using
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.040]   proactive and reactive
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.040]   takedown
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   Very often I use
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   one of my longest weapons as a decoy
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   to get in your leg
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   use my jab
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040]   to create a distraction
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   then I can get in
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.040]   Um
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   Other guys for example
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   like Khabib
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.040]   they're more like chain wrestlers
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   they shoot sometimes but
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   they're very good at using for example
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   the fence as
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   like pushing you to the fence
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   and then from there
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   they're using their
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   their wrestling from there
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   I'm more of a
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   more of a dynamic
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   I like to explode
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   so that's one of my strengths
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   which Khabib is very good at for example
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   very good technically
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   and also his
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   isometric strength I heard
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   so he's very good with this style of wrestling
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   Do you think you can take Khabib down?
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   I think I could yeah
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   I think he could take me down as well but
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   So how do I defend against this?
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   So there's many ways
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.040]   First you need to be aware of the distance control
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   That's one of the things
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   I was the best at
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   To master the distance control
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   you need to master the footwork
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   to be always in balance
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   and ready to fight
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   and not to explode
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   A lot of guys they don't know how to manage distance control
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.040]   also because they don't have good footwork
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   they cross their leg
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   they go all over the place so when you move
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   it's important if I go left
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   I push up with my right
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   if I go right I push up with my left
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   I go back I push with my lead
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   I go forward I push with my back
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   This is the basic
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   Thereafter you can use different
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   illusions
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   So if I'm here I look
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   I'm more of a threat to you
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   But I'm at the same distance
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   So one of my favorite ways to set up a takedown
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   a single or double
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   I use my jab which is one of my longest weapons
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   Of course my legs are longer
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   but I like the jab to create the distraction
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   So if I'm here you see me coming
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.040]   So I use a distraction
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.040]   I'm here like a cobra
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.040]   like a snake who launches itself on its prey
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   I'm using my body to
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.040]   So you have a false feeling of security now
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.040]   because you think I can't touch you
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   but because of my leg
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   boom
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.040]   and my
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.040]   and my jab starts
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   outside of your field of vision
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   So I'm not doing this
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.040]   I'm doing it purposely I'm putting it down
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   and I'm here and I'm attracting your attention here
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   because I'm moving my hand
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   boom once I tag you once or twice
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   now I have a perfect set up
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   because in fighting you have a
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.040]   short term memory
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   you always remember what hurts you
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   the last
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   and if it's my jab then I can
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   I plant a seed in your mind
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.040]   and go hop and get in easier
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   When you finish hop
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   you drop
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   There is many ways the best
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   highest per second move is the
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   elbow deep double leg
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   so when I get in I try to look
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.040]   across when I step across
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   so I get in I go elbow deep
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   the reason why I don't only go with my legs
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   is because if you're stronger and bigger than me
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   and you sprawl from there I can have a hard time
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   but if I go elbow deep
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   because of the leverage
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   you can't sprawl
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   I look across and I drive across
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   to put you down
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   sometimes you'll fight a guy
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.040]   like for example
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   Bisping was very strong
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.040]   and I couldn't drive across
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   so when that happens
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   if you can't drive across
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   you turn the corner
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   because
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   they open up on the other side
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.040]   would you like to try?
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   sure
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.040]   so I'm here
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.040]   yes go with your leg
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.040]   elbow deep here
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   and now you're going to drive across
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   yes
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   step across with you
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   if you do it again
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   jab
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   set it up jab
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   now go for it
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   yes
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   exactly
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.040]   and if I give you resistance
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.040]   once you get in I'm strong
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.040]   and I'm sprawling my leg
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   if you turn the corner
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   jab set it up if you find
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   I'm sprawling
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   yes
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   very nice
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   you feel the difference?
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.040]   if he's too strong you go on the other side
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   don't force or waste your energy
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   try to be as economic as you can
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.040]   as possibly you can be
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   what about on the ground
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   what's the difference in Jiu Jitsu for you and MMA?
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.040]   well there's a lot of difference
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   I believe
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   in Jiu Jitsu
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.040]   especially in the guard
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   you can't stay in mid range
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   I cover like this like I'm in a standing position
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   I want to cover like this
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.040]   my head is on the ground
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   my muscles of my abdominals are contracted
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.040]   so it's possible
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   for you to damage here but because I'm contracted
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   it's less likely
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   so I want to focus all the protection
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.040]   on my head
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.040]   are you ok with this?
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.040]   yes it's ok but I want to be here
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.040]   there's a gap where I can see you here
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   if I'm here it's not as efficient because you can go on the side
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   and it's easy for you to grab
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.040]   grab my wrist put it down
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   and hit
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   if I'm here it's harder for you
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   to control my arm if you want to grab it's hard for you to grab
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   so that's the first thing
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   another thing if your hand is right here
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   I want to take away your hand on me
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   I want to pull you
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   to me I want to control your head and your arm
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.040]   and from there there's many options
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.040]   I like to take that clamp because it controls your elevation
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   and you can't hit me
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   it's either I'm very close to you
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   or
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.040]   I'm very far
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   can you try to get up?
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.040]   I can't get up no problem
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.040]   I'm using my leg to push you away
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   or I can use the tip
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   of my feet to create distance
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   so you need to be aware that I can
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   kick you in the head too
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   it's either very close
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.040]   or very far
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.040]   on top?
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   if I'm on top the best position for me to be
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.040]   ultimately is
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.040]   not even mount
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.040]   is to have your back
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.040]   let you to the floor
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.040]   from this position because now you can't
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.040]   hit me
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.040]   I can hit you and I can either knock you out
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   or submit you
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   this is the worst
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   mount is the second best
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   because I'm having a lot of control
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.040]   mount and also with my knees
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   under your armpit
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   the worst would be in your guard
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   so it's not as bad as
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   if you would be in a jiu jitsu
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   competition because I have the
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   gravity on my side
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   but if I'm here I need to respect three rules
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   I never want to
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   let you to put my hands on the floor
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   submission all kinds of things
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   you can very easily wrap my arm
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   and wrap my head close the distance
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   and now it's a thing for me
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   so no way on the floor
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.040]   I don't want you to have your head
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.040]   higher than my head
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   because if your head is higher than my head
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   you have a guillotine
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   it's very hard for me to control and do anything to you
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   if my head is lower than your head
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   and another thing
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.040]   the third thing is I don't want to let you
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   take an angle of me so if you take an angle
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.040]   what did you get at me?
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.040]   you see you need to take an angle
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   so if I take away that angle
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   I kill your offense
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.040]   so my hands always on you never on the floor
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   are you trying to hit a little bit?
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.040]   yeah I can hit them at the same time
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   if you try to raise your head up
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   I don't accept it
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   if you try to take an angle
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   I put you back in line
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   so if I respect these three rules
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   as I'm respecting these three rules
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   I can cause damage
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   even if I'm in the guard
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   I can get to a more dominant position
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   I love it
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   in a nutshell
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   that's what it's about
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   you guys got a chance to train with Elon
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   to watch him train
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.040]   take steps on his martial arts journey
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.040]   what do you think?
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   I think he's very strong
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.040]   much stronger than the average man
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   he's got a lot of heart
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.040]   he's very tough
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   I've always found that
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   by far and away the most important thing
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   to train
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   is how people get into a clash
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   skill level trumps everything else
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.040]   in terms of what's going to turn me out
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   skill beats are
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   skill beats is important
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.040]   that's not to say other things aren't relevant
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.040]   but skill is more relevant
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   from what I understand his proposed opponent
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   has almost two years of training experience
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   that's a big advantage
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   so it will be an uphill battle
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   I will say however though
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   that he deeply impressed both George and myself
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   with his overall
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   ability to grasp his subject
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   and his ability to learn
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   and he's extremely intelligent
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   and sees what is the crux of the problem
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   identifies what needs to be done
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   but I also believe
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   that he's probably one of the busiest human beings on the planet
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   that said
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   these guys doing martial arts
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   training martial arts is pretty phenomenal
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   I think ultimately the deepest lesson
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   is that both of these guys have had an amazing impact
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   on 21st century society
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   and they still have a lot of work to do
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   and I think
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   that they are people who
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   have put themselves in a position
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   where they can create
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   greater benefits for humanity
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   than almost anyone else in the world
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   and so there's a sense in which
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   I wish they would focus more on that
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   than fighting each other
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   alright so one more round
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   this is for everything
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   yes sir
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   this is for the greatest fighter of all time right here
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.040]   yeah
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   nice
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.880]   Thank you, next.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.120]   Thank you.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.140]   - Yes.
