[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I'm here training with George St. Pierre, probably the greatest fighter of all time and also one of the nicest guys of all time.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Not the nicest guy, not today.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Not today, Nex. You came on the wrong day, my friend.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   He's breathing hard.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Sorry.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Hit, hit.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Hit, hit.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Advice shot.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   He dies, he dies.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   He dies, he dies.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Any advice?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Well, it's actually pretty good. Standing position, I think, sometimes you reach a little bit too much.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   So, if you reach out to me, it's easy for me to take a good position.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Or, reach out to me, I can probably like, climb back on you.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So, what I would suggest is, don't reach, get closer with your feet before you seek contact with me.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Don't go here, go closer to each other.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yes.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Hit.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Hit, hit.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Hit.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Hit.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Hit, hit, hit.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Hit, hit.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Hit, hit.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So, how is it different if you do MMA?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Well, there's a lot of difference because in grappling, you set up, for example, your takedown from hand fighting.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   In MMA, there's different styles.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I like to be using proactive and reactive takedown.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Very often, I use one of my longest weapon as a decoy to get in your leg.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Use my jab to create a distraction, then I can get in.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Other guys, for example, like Khabib, are more like chain wrestler.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   They shoot sometimes, but they're very good at using, for example, the defense as, like, pushing you to defense.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And then from there, they're using their wrestling from there.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So, I'm more of a dynamic.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yeah, I like to explode.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So, that's one of my strengths.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Which Khabib is very good at, for example, at very good technically and he's very strong in isometric strength, I heard.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So, he's very good with this style of wrestling.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Do you think you can take Khabib down?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I think I could, yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I think he could take me down as well, but...
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So, how do I defend against this?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So, there's many ways.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   First, you need to be aware of the distance control.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's one of the things that was the best step.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   To master the distance control, you need to master the footwork.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   To be always in balance and ready to explode.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   A lot of guys, they don't know how to manage distance control.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Also, because they don't have good footwork.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   They cross their leg, they go all over the place.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So, when you move, it's important when...
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   If I go left, I push off with my right.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   If I go right, I push off with my left.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I go back, I push with my lead.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I go forward, I push with my back.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   This is the basic.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Thereafter, you can use different illusion.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So, if I'm here, I look like I'm more of a threat to you than if I'm here.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   But I'm at the same distance.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So, one of my favorite way to set up a takedown, a single or double, I use my jab.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Which is one of my longest weapon.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Of course, my legs are longer, but I like the jab to create the distraction.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So, if I'm here, you see me coming.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So, I use a distraction.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I'm here, like a cobra, like a snake who launch itself on its prey.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I'm using my body to...
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So, you have a false feeling of security now.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Because you think I can't touch you, but because of my leg...
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   - Oh, you're shifting your weight. - Yes.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   - And now you can explode off it.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   - And my jab start outside of your field of vision.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So, I'm not doing this.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I'm doing purpose, I'm putting it down, and I'm here.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And I'm attracting your attention here, because I'm moving my hand.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Boom!
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Once I tag you once or twice, now I have a perfect set up.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Because in fighting, you have a short-term memory.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You always remember what hurts you the last.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And if it's my jab, then I can...
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I plant a seed in your mind, then I can go hop and get in easier.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   - And you finish how? You drop?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   - There is many ways. The best, highest percentile move is the elbow deep double leg.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So, when I get in, I try to look across when I step across.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So, I get in, I go elbow deep.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   The reason why I don't only go with my legs is because if you're stronger and bigger than me,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and you sprawl from there, I can have a hard time.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   But if I go elbow deep, because of the leverage, you can't sprawl.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Once I'm in, I look across and I drive across.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   To put you down.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Sometimes you'll fight a guy, like for example, Bisping was very strong.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And I couldn't drive across.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So, when that happens, if you can't drive across, you turn the corner.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   - Nice.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   - Because, that's... they open up on the other side.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Would you like to try?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   - Sure.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   - Yeah.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   - So, I'm here.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   - Yes. Go with your elbow deep here.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And now you're going to drive across.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Yes. Step across with you. Yes.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   If you do it again, jab.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Set it up, jab.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Now go ahead, go for it. Up.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Yes. Yes. Exactly.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And if I give you resistance, once you get in, I'm struggling and I'm sprawling my leg, you turn the corner.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So, jab, set it up if you're fine. Jab.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I'm sprawling. Yes.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Very nice. You feel the difference?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   - Yeah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   - So, if he's too strong, you go on the other side.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Don't force or don't waste your energy for nothing.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Try to be as economic as you can, as possibly you could be.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   - What about on the ground, what's the difference in Jiu-Jitsu for you and not in MMA?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   - Well, there's a lot of difference.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I believe in Jiu-Jitsu, especially in the guard, you can't stay mid-range.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I don't want to cover like this, like if I'm in a standing position.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I want to cover like this.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   My head is on the ground, my muscles of my abdominal are contracted.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So, it's possible for you to do damage here, but because I'm contracted, it's less likely.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So, I want to focus all the protection on my head.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   - You're okay with this?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   - Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. But I want to be here.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   So, there's a gap where I can see you here.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   If I'm here, it's not as efficient because you can go on the side.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And it's easy for you to grab my wrist, put it down, and hit.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   If I'm here, it's harder for you to control my arm.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   If you want to grab, it's hard for you to grab.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So, that's the first thing.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Another thing, if your hand is over here, I want to take away your hand on me.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I want to pull you to me.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I want to control your head and your arm.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And from there, there's many options.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I like to take the clamp because it controls your elevation and you can't hit me.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   It's either I'm very close to you or I'm very far.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   - Can you try to get up?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   - I'm very far. Yeah, if I can't get up, no problem.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I'm using my leg to push you away or I can use the tip of my feet to create distance.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So, you need to be aware that I can kick you in the head too.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So, it's either very close or very far.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   - Or go on top.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   - On top, yeah. So, if I'm on top, the best position for me to be,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   ultimately, is not even mount, is to have your back,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   let you to the floor from this position.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Because now you cannot hit me, I can hit you and I can either knock you out or submit you.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   This is the worst.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Mount is the second best because I'm having a lot of control.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Mount and also with my knees under your armpit.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The worst would be in your guard.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It's not as bad as if you would be in a jiu-jitsu competition
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   because I have the gravity on my side.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   But if I'm here, I need to respect three rules.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I never want you to put my hands on the floor and go submission, all kinds of things.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   You can very easily wrap my arm and wrap my head, close the distance.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And now it's a thing for me.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So, no hands on the floor.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I don't want you to have your head higher than my head.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Because if your head is higher than my head, you have a guillotine.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's very hard for me to control and do anything to you if my head is lower than your head.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And another thing, the third thing, is I don't want to let you take an angle of me.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So if you take an angle, you do a jujitsu kata on me, you see, you need to take an angle.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So if I take away that angle, I kill your offense.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   So, my hands always on you, never on the floor.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   - Are you trying to hit a little bit? - Yeah, I can hit at the same time.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   If you try to raise your head up, I don't accept that you have my head high.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   If you try to take an angle, I put you back in line.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So if I respect these three rules, as I'm respecting these three rules, I can cause damage.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Even if I'm in the guard.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   My goal is always, eventually, to pass the guard, get to a more dominant position.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   - I love it. - In a nutshell, that's what it's about.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   - Well, thank you, Jurek. - No, man.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You guys got a chance to train with Elon, to watch him train, take steps on his martial arts journey.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   - What do you think? - I think he's very strong.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Much stronger than the average man.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   He's got a lot of heart. He's very tough.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So, I've always found that by far and away the most important thing,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   when two people get into a clash, skill level trumps everything else in terms of what's going to turn the outcome.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   - Skill beats heart. - Skill beats everything.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   That's not to say other things aren't relevant, but skill is more relevant.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   From what I understand, his proposed opponent has almost two years of training experience.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   That's a big advantage.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So it will be an uphill battle.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I will say, however, though, that I'm deeply impressed with both George and myself,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   with his overall ability to watch the subject from a very good angle.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   He's extremely intelligent and sees what is the crux of the problem, identifies what would need to be done.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   But I also believe that he's probably one of the busiest human beings on the planet.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   That said, these guys doing martial arts, training martial arts is pretty damn awesome.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I think, ultimately, the deepest lesson is that both of these guys have had an amazing impact on 21st century society
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and both still have a lot of work to do.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I think they're two people who have put themselves in a position where they can create greater benefits for humanity
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   than almost anyone else can afford.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And so there's a sense in which I wish they would focus more on that than fighting each other.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   All right, so one more round. This is for everything. It's a submission.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Yes, sir!
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   This is for the greatest fighter of all time.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Yes, sir!
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Yes, sir!
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.240]   - Thank you, Lex.
