[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.920]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.060]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need

[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I am your host,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   and today I want to share with you a simple idea
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.480]   to help you to coach your children
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.020]   to acquiring the skills and ability and knowledge
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.420]   that they will need to be successful and effective in life.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.320]   And then in the latter part of the show,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.960]   I will introduce briefly a series of episodes
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.260]   that you'll hear coming in the coming days.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.800]   One of the goals that we all have as parents
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.900]   is the success of our children.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.240]   If you have children and you've set goals,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.380]   I'm sure that on your list of goals,
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.300]   you have goals related to the success of your children.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.620]   But as with many things in life and in money,
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.180]   it seems that we often gravitate to the goals
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.680]   that are the easiest to enumerate in clear numbers.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.920]   I've worked with many people who say,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.660]   "I have a goal of saving $50,000
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.460]   "for my children's college education,"
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.820]   or "I have a goal of sending my child
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.600]   "to a private school," et cetera.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.660]   These goals are useful because they're easily identified.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.900]   You can understand if you're hitting them or not.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.840]   And yet, as with many things that I've observed
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.620]   related to money, while not wrong,
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.580]   they're sometimes not the most effective way
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.740]   of accomplishing what you're really trying to accomplish,
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.820]   what you really want to make happen.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.100]   What you really want is for your children
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.540]   to be successful, not to have a college degree.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.900]   Now, to the extent that the college degree
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780]   helps them to be successful in life,
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.000]   to live the life of their dreams,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.260]   to be happy, to be fulfilled, to be competent,
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.980]   to be effective, to be provided for, et cetera,
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.060]   then it fits into that.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.580]   But the fundamental plan is that you want
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.900]   your children to be successful.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.020]   And you know, and the reason why I'm talking
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.060]   about this on a personal finance show,
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.940]   that not only do our children consume
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.340]   a tremendous amount of financial resources,
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.340]   but there are few pains greater for a wealthy person
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.700]   than if that wealthy person has to survey
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.020]   children who are failures in life,
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.420]   in whatever sense you consider someone
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.580]   to be a failure in life.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.260]   It's very painful, very, very painful.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.480]   And yet we have a few precious years
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.900]   where we can make a tremendous difference
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.460]   into our children's lives.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.700]   Now, during those years, especially in the younger years,
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.700]   we do a number of important things with our children.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.780]   But at its core, what we do is we install
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.280]   into our children, in some ways, an operating system.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.900]   I don't believe in the tabula rasa theory,
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.180]   the idea that children are just a blank slate.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.180]   It's a little bit,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.860]   I think that's a little bit excessive.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.480]   But in many ways, children are a blank slate.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.060]   And as parents, we install into them
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.540]   the operating system that makes them tick.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.260]   They have all the basic hardware,
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.700]   but it's the input that they receive in their life
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.500]   that will largely determine what they think about life.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.560]   Now, a lot of that input is not accidental,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.740]   but it's out of your control.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.500]   I've often imagined,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.180]   you know, what do people,
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.720]   you know, a child who's raised in the war-torn,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.460]   in the middle of a civil war,
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.420]   where at eight years old,
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.500]   somebody puts an AK-47 in their hand and says, "Go kill."
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   Right, that's a devastating virus to install
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.480]   into the software set of a child.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.780]   And yet, we infect our children so many times
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.040]   with viruses that are unnecessary.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.540]   And a lot of times, it happens accidentally,
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.720]   happens based upon the inputs and the influences
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.520]   that we allow into their lives,
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.020]   which is why, as parents, we have a responsibility
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.940]   to be so extraordinarily careful and picky
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.780]   about what we allow into their lives,
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.260]   to make sure that, in essence,
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.400]   the operating system that they receive,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.620]   the way of looking at the world,
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.500]   the way of thinking about things is appropriate,
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.380]   is as correct, is as useful as we can possibly make it,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.080]   is as genuinely,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.060]   is as close to truth as we are able to accomplish.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.180]   So how do you do that?
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.500]   Well, I think first, it involves
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.620]   living an examined life yourself,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.360]   doing your very best as a parent
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.500]   to understand what you believe and why you believe it,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.300]   doing your best to live as a model before your children.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.940]   Ideally, all of us who are parents
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.740]   should be able to say, "Follow me, do as I do,
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.300]   "model me, imitate me, copy me."
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.020]   I've often found, I think,
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.860]   some of the most compelling words in scripture,
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.780]   "Follow me as I follow Christ."
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.740]   That was, of course, the Apostle Paul,
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.740]   or to put it into a more modern translation,
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.140]   "And you should imitate me just as I imitate Christ."
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.940]   I think that, at its core, as parents,
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.780]   our goal should be to lay before our children
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.740]   an example that is worthy of following,
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.900]   and that, to the extent that we can do that effectively,
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.760]   we can make an enormous impact in their lives.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.140]   We all know that none of us will be perfect,
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.300]   none of us will live perfectly,
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.020]   none of us will do things perfectly for them,
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.020]   but we know that if we can do that effectively over time,
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.660]   then that'll be the strongest influence in their lives.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.940]   They're going to want to be like you.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.860]   They're going to want to do the things that you do.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.260]   And as a man, I find that incredibly motivating,
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.740]   because I often look myself in the mirror,
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.740]   and I think, "Would I want my child to do what I'm doing?
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.220]   "Do I want my son to model me, to copy me?
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.040]   "Do I want my daughter to live as I'm living?
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.520]   "What do I want them to see?
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.780]   "And if so, I'd better make it real,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.160]   "because I can't fool my children.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.780]   "I can't tell my children that I am something,
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.980]   "or I believe something, and it not be the truth,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.400]   "'cause they will know, and worse,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   "not only will they know that I was wrong about that,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.800]   "that I lied about that,
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.480]   "but now they'll know that I'm a liar.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.020]   "They'll know that I'm an inauthentic liar,"
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.980]   which would, of course, be devastating
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.980]   to their image of me and what things would happen.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.740]   But in addition to that,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.300]   I think we need to install into our children positive ideas,
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.420]   ideas that have served the test of time,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.300]   ideas that will help them in life,
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.340]   ideas that are empowering to them.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.800]   And I believe that if you're a parent,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.020]   you're nodding your head with me.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.780]   I can't imagine anybody would brook disagreement
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.380]   with what I'm saying.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.900]   But the question is how, how do you do that?
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.020]   Well, I think at its core,
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.300]   ideally, you do it intentionally.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.340]   And where I see the biggest weaknesses in life
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.900]   is often with regard to philosophy,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.260]   instilling philosophy, a way of thinking,
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.660]   a way of living, a way of being into children.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.940]   If you participate in the mainstream school system,
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.940]   your child will receive basic instruction in math facts,
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.740]   basic instruction in literacy,
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.820]   basic instruction in basic knowledge of the world,
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.600]   perhaps an appreciation of some bare facts of history
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.240]   and geography, et cetera,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.440]   maybe an appreciation of how to wield a paintbrush
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.180]   or how to do a breaststroke.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.380]   But at the end of the day,
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.860]   the philosophy that is going to be articulated
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.460]   to your child in a formal school setting
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.300]   is often not a philosophy with teeth.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.740]   It's often not a fully well-rounded philosophy.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.700]   There will be a philosophy accompanied by it
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.780]   because facts don't exist in a vacuum.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.580]   Facts are always laden with a philosophical worldview.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.060]   And that's why you and I have a responsibility
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.540]   to be so cautious and so careful as to the teachers
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.540]   that we allow into our children's lives.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.460]   But at its core, since that kind of training
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.460]   and instruction is fundamentally religious in nature,
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.420]   it's difficult for avowed non-religious schools to do it,
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.420]   which means that children often pick up their philosophy
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.500]   from their friends or from popular sources.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.420]   And we don't install a better operating system.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.220]   We don't install a better philosophy.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.140]   So I wanna give you some suggestions
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.960]   on how I think you should install a better philosophy.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.180]   At its fundamental level, you'll of course wanna begin
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.180]   with a religious worldview.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.040]   You'll wanna begin with the great questions of life,
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   the meaning of life, the purpose of life, et cetera.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.840]   And so if you ascribe to a particular religious tradition,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.920]   it's made simpler for you.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.560]   It's made easier for you because you say,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.900]   hey, this is what we believe,
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.860]   and we're going to install this operating system,
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.720]   these ideas, this philosophy into our children.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.600]   For someone who comes from a structured background,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.640]   who's part of a structured religious tradition,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.080]   many times there are catechisms or family instruction
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.280]   manuals that you can use,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.040]   and that can be very, very helpful.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.160]   That may form the base.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.460]   But there are a lot of other philosophies
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.480]   that would not be taught in that kind of religious tradition
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.560]   that you'll want to pay attention to,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.480]   especially philosophies and points of thinking
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   with regard to money, life, success,
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.520]   how much control you have over what happens to your life.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   And I believe that you can install from a very early age
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.600]   philosophies that will make a big difference.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.800]   You can do this in many ways.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.520]   You might just be a purveyor of pithy proverbs,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.320]   and as such, you drop these little gems
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.160]   into your child's heart.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.240]   These are the classic things
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.120]   that perhaps your grandmother said.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.460]   A person convinced against their will
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.640]   is of the same opinion still.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.040]   There's a great truth and meaning in that axiom
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.020]   that if a child grasps it can make a big difference.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.200]   Or related to money, profits are better than wages.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.960]   Profits are better than wages.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.840]   A simple statement like that,
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.760]   repeated hundreds of times throughout a child's life,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.160]   whenever appropriate, will have a profound impact
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   on the financial philosophy of a child.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.840]   Profits are better than wages.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.920]   Pay yourself first.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.540]   Whatever your little sayings are,
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.560]   they make a big impact in your children's lives.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.240]   There may be things that you don't say.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.280]   For example, I'm very cautious to never say
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.960]   something like, I can't afford that.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.480]   I never use those words, either to myself
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.280]   and especially not in the presence of my children.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   I never say, I can't afford that.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.880]   Because I know that I can afford anything
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.160]   that I choose to afford, it's just a matter
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.320]   of am I willing to pay the price
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.640]   to accumulate the resources necessary
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.240]   to be able to afford it.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.200]   And so I'll use language of responsibility,
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.920]   such as, we choose not to spend money on that.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.480]   Or, I don't think that's worth spending money on.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.600]   I don't think that's a good buy.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.100]   I don't think that's worth it.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.900]   Similar things.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.100]   I never say, I don't have time.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.260]   I might say sometimes, I feel like I don't have time,
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.780]   but I don't say, I don't have time.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.820]   And I especially am never gonna say that to my children.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.380]   I don't have time.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.380]   The answer is, I have the same amount of time
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.340]   as anybody else, so it's not the matter of having time,
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.580]   it's a matter of my personal priorities.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.060]   But this goes far beyond.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.060]   This goes far beyond to things like complaining.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.060]   It goes to, how do you talk about other people?
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.500]   It goes to the respect that you use
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.580]   to talk to other people.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.800]   The example that we set before our children
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.780]   makes a tremendous difference in how they think
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.940]   about life and how they think about others.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.580]   I think there's still a need, however,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:15.580]   to install deeper level philosophies.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.560]   And I want you to think about how to do that
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.420]   in your child's life.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.060]   If there's something that you think is important,
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.380]   how are you going to install it into their life?
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.540]   How are you gonna cause them to think what you think?
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.900]   What it's core, you're gonna have to tell them
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.820]   what you think and why you think it.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.580]   And that's our responsibility as parents to say,
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.100]   this is what I believe is correct.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.300]   This is what I believe is right.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.340]   And here's why I believe it's correct.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.220]   Here's why I believe it's right.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.640]   One of the most powerful ways to do that,
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.280]   in addition to your personal example,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.700]   in addition to your personal stories
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.000]   and your personal instruction,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.620]   is to invite other people who are qualified teachers
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.280]   into your home to give those lessons.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.520]   And so this is what you do when you're helping your child
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.440]   with their numeracy.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.080]   This is what you do when you're helping your child
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.560]   with their piano.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.660]   You invite a teacher into your home.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.660]   But how do you invite the teachers that can speak broadly?
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.480]   I would say the simple and obvious answer to that
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.180]   is read to your children.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.240]   The books that you choose to read to your children
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.440]   will make a tremendous difference in their life
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.280]   and it will shape their thinking.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   It will shape their way of operating.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.640]   And if you'll give them the tools that they need
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.760]   to be successful in life,
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.760]   both through your direct instruction
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.720]   and by passive instruction with books
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.340]   and things that you put before them,
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.460]   you'll help them to be able to navigate situations.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.920]   Now this is intensely practical.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   At an early age, there are so many things you can do.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.200]   You know, I just recently, a while ago,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.380]   I found this wonderful book for children.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.660]   It's not in English, it's in Spanish,
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.080]   but it's called Mis Palabras.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.000]   And it's written by someone who's a Montessori teacher.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.600]   And it's this really well done story
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.280]   where it involves a boy and a girl
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.440]   having an argument on the playground.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.400]   And in the first example, they have an argument.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.880]   They wind up kicking each other,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.160]   they wind up throwing sand at each other
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.180]   'cause they're angry 'cause they don't know
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.520]   how to use words to communicate,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.780]   to solve their problems thoughtfully.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.640]   And then the protagonists in the book
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.140]   teach the Montessori method of using
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.040]   basically a speaking stick where you speak
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.000]   and you listen to one another.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.800]   And then of course, magically in the storybook,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   the children work it out and they resolve their problems.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.720]   Now it's a great kid's book.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.160]   But it teaches a lesson that if we teach our children
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   and we give them the tools,
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.560]   or here's how you settle conflict
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.900]   and you do it in a peaceful, nonviolent way,
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.120]   it's extraordinarily helpful.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.620]   It helps tremendously.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.380]   And yet, do you do that?
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.200]   Are you giving your children the tools that they need?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.060]   The simple everyday tools of society matter tremendously.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.560]   I'll give you a simple example.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.020]   I teach my children with very modest success
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.180]   at this stage of their life,
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.360]   but I aspire to be able to do this
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.220]   with more success in time.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.280]   But I teach my children how to talk to people.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.260]   And a simple tactic, for example,
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.080]   I teach my children that when somebody finishes talking,
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.700]   you should wait three to five seconds.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.000]   I make them count to four.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.200]   You know, three, four, five seconds
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.620]   to make sure that they're really done with their speech.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.460]   It's an incredibly valuable technique
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.780]   that you and I use every day,
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.680]   that when someone speaks,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.140]   you just simply cultivate the habit
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.380]   of not responding immediately, not interrupting,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.700]   not correcting immediately, but stop and wait
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.400]   just three to five seconds to see if they're fully done.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.420]   And it's a powerful tool in communication
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.680]   to help you become a better conversationalist.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.920]   And yet, were you ever taught that as a child?
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.820]   Did your teachers ever say,
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.220]   "Let me teach you how to be a conversationalist?"
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.720]   Years ago, I used to go to networking events
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.640]   and cocktail parties,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.320]   and it's often been hard for me to talk to people
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.480]   that I didn't know.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.960]   And I stumbled across in a book
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.360]   a list of 10 conversation starter questions,
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.460]   just general, normal stuff
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.780]   that some people don't have to study.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.100]   Things like, "How did you get involved in this business?"
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.520]   Just simple things like that
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.440]   that are simple, open-ended questions
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.580]   that facilitate and lubricate the early stages
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.060]   of a conversation in that kind of context.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.280]   I memorized them, and I just practiced using them.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.480]   Well, one of the things that I will do
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.360]   as my children get older
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.140]   is I'll give them similar questions.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.780]   Here are ways that you start a conversation.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.540]   I remember my wife, when she was younger,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.740]   she tells me that she felt just very awkward.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.840]   She didn't know how to talk to people
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.300]   because she didn't know how to start a conversation.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.620]   And yet, if you just simply input
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.680]   into your children's operating system,
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.180]   read them a book on how to be a great conversationalist,
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.900]   and then have them memorize, as part of their education,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.620]   10 questions that you can use to start a conversation,
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.040]   and then have them practice,
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.680]   you can help your child to be a great conversationalist.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.860]   And that little bit of practice
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.280]   in their operating system is incredibly valuable.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.560]   Now, I think your basic tool
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.220]   is simply to have your child read books.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.340]   But I think many people wait too long
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.540]   to start to have their child do it.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.740]   They wait until their child is 15 and say,
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.700]   "Okay, when you're 15, I'm gonna give you a book on money,"
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.060]   instead of starting earlier.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.520]   And so I think that we should start earlier.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   I think that we should read our children useful books
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.800]   that teach them lessons.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   Now, the best way to do it
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.260]   is usually in the context of a story.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.260]   A story or a parable that has a lesson,
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.080]   a moral lesson, a practical lesson embedded within it,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.600]   is the most powerful teaching device that we have.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.560]   And so you can choose and should choose carefully books,
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.720]   resources, et cetera,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.580]   that are going to help your children to learn lessons.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.220]   And you should read them intentionally to your children.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.220]   What I would encourage you today, however,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.940]   is don't stop with children's books.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.940]   I see no reason not to take the very best resources
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.500]   for adults and then share them with your children
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.160]   and to do it from a very early age.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.000]   So I'll give you an example
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.660]   and I'll tell you how I'm doing this.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.260]   And you can watch over the years
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.780]   and we'll see how effective this is.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.000]   But sometimes I like to say things in advance
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.480]   so that if it is effective and if it works,
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.000]   you know it's not by accident.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.160]   Kind of like when you're playing pool, you call your shots
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.460]   so you know it wasn't just slop.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:14.460]   I read all kinds of books to my children.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.180]   And I try to choose lots of books, storybooks,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.660]   first of all, that are perfectly clean,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.780]   that have model character, model behavior,
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.020]   that have the values that our family stands for.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.780]   And it's very difficult,
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.020]   but we actually work very hard often
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.020]   to weed out the most, the bad example.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.460]   I don't have any data,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.300]   I've never really been able to prove this,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.140]   but I don't think it helps children
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.620]   who don't have a very good filter
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.540]   to see examples of badness, whatever that badness is.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.780]   I'll give you a silly example, you'll laugh.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.940]   But it's a true example.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.380]   A number of years ago,
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.020]   my wife kicked Curious George out of our house.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.660]   Now, it's hard to find anybody who's gonna say,
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.500]   Curious George is not,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.660]   is anything wrong with Curious George?
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.160]   You got this classic book that's just fun about a monkey.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.020]   But if you look at the Curious George stories,
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.100]   in every single story, Curious George is basically naughty.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.580]   He disobeys almost everything that he's told,
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.740]   he gets into problems that are very significant problems,
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.140]   and then through some great stroke of life,
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.660]   stroke of luck, he escapes by the skin of his teeth,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.820]   and everything is fine,
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.260]   and he bears no consequences for his behavior.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.500]   And I loved Curious George when I was a child,
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.340]   and she pointed out to me,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.620]   like, no, but I like Curious George,
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.180]   and then I realized, you know what, she's right.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.180]   This is nothing but an example of a naughty monkey
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.620]   who never pays for his misdeeds,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.980]   who's never held accountable.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.660]   Now, is that going to turn my child into a delinquent?
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.620]   I don't think so.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.580]   But in that same time,
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.860]   where we're reading a negative example,
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.340]   that's just, oh, this is fun, this is harmless,
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.340]   I could be using a positive example.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.700]   And instead of filling my child's mind
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.620]   with the idea of a naughty monkey,
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.560]   who's forever causing problems
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   and getting away with his mischievousness,
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.780]   I could choose to do an example of kindness,
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.620]   of love, of people being obedient,
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.580]   of people behaving properly,
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.060]   because the examples that are held in front of us
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.820]   impact us to a very high degree.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:41.820]   So think carefully about what you allow into your life
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.060]   and into your children's lives.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.740]   So practically, that's an example
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.940]   of getting rid of the negative.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.340]   Now, if negative comes in,
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.660]   I think you can mitigate the negative by talking about it,
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.340]   by discussing it.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.340]   And this is something I think that we need to continually do.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.700]   You will not be able to as a parent,
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.380]   nor necessarily should you always shelter your child
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.820]   from negative things.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.480]   But what I think we need to do is when they come in,
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.260]   we need to think critically about them
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:17.100]   and learn how to engage with them in an appropriate way.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.980]   Number of years ago,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.720]   my children were playing with another boy,
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.140]   and this boy told them
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.140]   that if you did such a certain thing,
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.140]   I'll give you a piece of candy when you get to the car.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.260]   And so my children happily complied.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.260]   And then they got to the car
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.580]   and they asked him for the candy.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.780]   And he said, "Oh, I don't have any candy."
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.860]   And the boy had blatantly lied to them
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.860]   and really hurt them.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.660]   They didn't know that at that time,
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.980]   they were fairly well-protected.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.020]   They didn't know that people lied.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.580]   They didn't know that people would lie to them.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.140]   And so it really hurt them.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.380]   And of course they responded,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.860]   "Well, I'm not gonna be your friend, et cetera."
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.580]   And so those are kind of examples are inevitable
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.420]   and they're important.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.260]   Our children need to face conflict and problems, et cetera.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.780]   But then they're an opportunity to say,
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.020]   "How do we respond?
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.140]   "What's the proper way?
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.680]   "And how can you understand things like this in the future?
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.620]   "How do you understand the real world?"
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.980]   I think one of the most valuable things you can do
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.900]   with young children is read them the kind of books
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.060]   that you read and you should be reading,
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.880]   especially as it relates to life skills.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.920]   So whatever you think is necessary
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.080]   for the success of your children, read them that book.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.460]   So I read my, right now, as an example,
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.380]   right now I'm reading my children,
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.380]   "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.700]   That's a book that is appropriate for a 70-year-old man
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.080]   and a seven-year-old child, in my opinion,
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.900]   because it basically gives useful things to think about,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.700]   useful principles of getting along with people,
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.020]   how to win friends and influence people.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.220]   And what we do, what I do, is number one,
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.620]   I fill the house with books,
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.140]   and I try to make sure that those books
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.940]   are all quality books, that all have some benefits.
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.140]   Some of them are technical books,
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.660]   some of them are stories, et cetera,
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.360]   but they're all gonna have some significant purpose to it.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.120]   So there's lots of books available
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.100]   that the child can read on their own.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.540]   I also wanna make sure that I read to them.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.100]   And so I do this in a couple different ways.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.180]   Number one, at the breakfast table,
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.820]   I always read at the breakfast table,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.340]   about 15 to 20 minutes,
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.580]   something that's going to be specifically helpful
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.700]   and instructional to my children.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.820]   Most of the time, this is materials
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.980]   that are aimed towards children, parables,
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.180]   stories about so-and-so, and with a lesson,
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.940]   an important lesson of a character quality,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.540]   et cetera, associated with it.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.260]   Right now, I'm using that time to read an adult book,
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.260]   "How to Win Friends and Influence People."
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.860]   In time, I'll use it to read books
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.660]   on how to be a conversationalist,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.860]   how to read, how to speak, how to listen,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.860]   how to be a friend, how to handle money.
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.820]   And if you would be, I mean,
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.060]   I guess I shouldn't say you'd be amazed,
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.940]   but it's impressive how much adds up
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.580]   with 15 or 20 minutes of reading
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.180]   right at the breakfast table.
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.680]   And what I like about it is by having a focus
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.740]   at the start of the day, at the breakfast table,
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.020]   on one specific thing that we're focusing on,
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.100]   as a parent, that now gives me a tool
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.820]   to point out to my children
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.980]   some way that we're doing a great job on it,
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.740]   or some way that we're not doing a great job on it.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.220]   So, you know, principle one
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.540]   on how to win friends and influence people,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.900]   never criticize, condemn, or complain.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.480]   And so we're working hard in our family
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.780]   on complaining at the moment.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.820]   There's never a reason to complain about anything.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.660]   Nobody wants to hear you complain.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.340]   And yet it's hard to get that through to children
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.740]   without examples and whatnot.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.540]   When I read to them chapter one
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.380]   of "How to Win Friends and Influence People,"
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.880]   then we had enough examples
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.820]   of showing how complaining,
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.620]   but now there's a more clear example.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.820]   My children are starting to catch themselves.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.140]   Oh, I was gonna complain.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.420]   Well, there's no reason to complain.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.540]   So there's never a point to complaining.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.940]   So let's just move on.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.180]   And it's great.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.060]   Principle two, right?
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.380]   Give honest and sincere appreciation.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.460]   And so by reading it over the course of several days,
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.740]   now I can remind, again,
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.140]   honest and sincere appreciation.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.060]   Then I work to catch them.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.420]   We do sticker charts in our household.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.660]   So let me catch you appreciating somebody,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.300]   selling someone, you know what?
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.760]   You know, brother or sister.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.360]   I appreciate this about you.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.640]   I appreciate you for this.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.200]   I appreciate this.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.620]   And getting them in the habit
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.300]   of expressing appreciation to other people.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.560]   And if you can instill that habit when a child is young,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.900]   it just becomes a part of who they are.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.700]   They're accustomed to expressing honest
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.300]   and sincere appreciation of other people.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.860]   And of course the principles go on.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.100]   So I would encourage you,
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.420]   as I wind down today's episode,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.960]   these things that we're talking about,
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   if you do them, as I want to say,
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.480]   if you do them,
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.000]   you'll often save yourself the money on the backside
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.080]   to have to pay someone else
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.260]   to try to make up for what you didn't do.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.740]   So financially, for example,
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.000]   I have the blessing that when I sit down
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.540]   at the breakfast table,
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.400]   I can sit down, we have breakfast,
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.680]   I can read for 20 minutes.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.520]   It's a leisurely thing.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.820]   And then I go to work.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.760]   But you can do that too.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.360]   Maybe for you, that's what financial independence means.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.300]   It means adjusting your work schedule
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.880]   so that you can have breakfast with your children
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.120]   and dinner with your children every day.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.860]   Maybe it means changing to a business so you can do it.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.080]   Maybe it means you cut back your hours
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.760]   so that you have more of that time available
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.560]   during those important years of parenting
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.680]   and plan to make it up later with hours.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.820]   Think about it.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.840]   But if you can spend 20 minutes a day
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.480]   of specific focused instruction on the moral character,
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.720]   the operating system, the personal philosophy
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.920]   of your children,
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.600]   that makes all the difference in the world.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.120]   And I would encourage you,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.560]   go out and look for the books
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.480]   that make the difference for you.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.560]   Look for the books that are gonna help you
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.980]   to do this effectively.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.780]   Maybe in the days to come,
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.200]   I can do something like a YouTube video
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.280]   and share with you some of the books
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.760]   that have been useful in our family
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.320]   and then solicit your recommendations,
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.600]   things that have been useful to you in your family.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.680]   But go out and look for them, buy them.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.920]   Start reading them to your children.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.560]   Read to them in the morning, read to them at night.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.640]   And what you'll find is that that will help you.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.960]   The best way to learn something effectively for yourself
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.720]   is to teach someone else.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.080]   So if there's something that you wanna get better at,
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.640]   get a book on it and start reading it to your children
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.460]   because now you'll have the motivation
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.080]   to get better together.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.360]   And don't be scared of older books,
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.240]   meaning books that are aimed at older children.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.160]   Again, I'm reading currently
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.680]   "How to Win Friends and Influence People"
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.400]   to a six-year-old, a four-year-old,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.360]   a three-year-old, and a one-year-old.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.680]   Now, a one-year-old will give him a pass, right?
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.640]   But on the other hand, the others,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.720]   they absorb some of it.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.560]   And what I like about also reading adult-level books,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.320]   and I don't recommend nor do I exclusively
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.240]   read adult-level books.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.540]   I like to read children's books
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.360]   because I don't want my children to be so lost
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.640]   that they don't understand and then they just tune out.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.380]   And so I read lots of stories and children's stories.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.200]   But I think it's important to even read adult-level books
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.080]   to your children so they understand there's more.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.040]   And it helps with their vocabulary development.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.360]   And they'll ask you questions about,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.920]   oh, this word and that word, et cetera.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.720]   And it helps them to think and see things
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.420]   from a mature perspective, even from a young age.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.320]   So don't be shy about
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.920]   reading adult-level books to your children.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.240]   It's worth it and it can really help.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.440]   Read to your children, instruct your children,
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.200]   engage with them, and install a philosophy
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.440]   that will lead to success in their heads.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.200]   Don't teach them to be victims.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.680]   Teach them to be victors.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.240]   Think through carefully what a philosophy
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   that will lead to success is, what it looks like,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.440]   and then get engaged and teach that to your children
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.300]   and you'll set them apart in life
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.620]   in a really powerful and profound way.
