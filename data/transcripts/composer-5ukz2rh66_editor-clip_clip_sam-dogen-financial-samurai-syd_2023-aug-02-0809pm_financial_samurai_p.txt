[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sydney
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.560]   from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.000]   And in this episode, we wanna do a catch up
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   because Sydney, you're back from almost a week
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.800]   in Tokyo, Japan.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.480]   The children and I missed you
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.280]   and we wanted to hear how your trip went
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.140]   and also some realizations that I had
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.280]   about basically being a single dad for almost a week.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.280]   So how was your trip?
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.600]   - It was good, it was very productive.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.240]   This wasn't like a vacation, just to clarify
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.200]   that I had to accompany my mother,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.040]   who's in her late 70s,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.640]   to take care of some family matters.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.880]   And I left the US on Monday,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.560]   which means I didn't get to my hotel
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   until Tuesday night in Japan.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.240]   And then was busy doing things Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.180]   and then left Japan Saturday morning
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.560]   and then got back here Saturday morning
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.440]   with a time difference.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.800]   So overall, it was a busy but productive trip
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.160]   and it went well.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.240]   I missed you guys too.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.960]   It was hard to be away,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.840]   but everything worked out pretty well.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.520]   - Yeah, it sounded really productive
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.220]   because for the couple months leading up to this trip,
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.760]   you seemed more stressed than usual,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.020]   especially since you lost your passport
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.360]   and you had to go through the whole debacle to get it.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.560]   I mean, it was like mission impossible.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560]   - It's been a rough six months.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160]   I don't know, for those of you out there
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   who have elderly parents whom you have to take care of,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.000]   I know how hard it is.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.480]   I don't even live with my mom.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.040]   She lives across the country,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.240]   but still, even having to help her
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.400]   through so many things from a distance is hard enough.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.540]   So it was a quite stressful six months
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.760]   and I feel a lot more at peace
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.040]   and content about things having gotten through this trip.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.160]   There's still a lot more that we still have to do,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.080]   but things are in much better shape than they were,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.040]   so that's great.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.560]   - And she's in professional hands with the lawyers in Japan
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.060]   to manage the estate for her sister,
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.340]   so that's good, that's important.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.760]   Managing the estate for our loved ones is very difficult,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.680]   even while they're living,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.040]   and so I think this is a good opportunity
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.720]   to remind everyone to put together that death file,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   sad to say, but it has information on usernames, passwords,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.100]   where to find the extra set of keys,
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.680]   and all these things that your loved ones
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.880]   need to know about if they're gonna handle your estate.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.720]   Consider putting together a revocable living trust
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.400]   to avoid probate, and talk to an estate planning lawyer.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.280]   These are professionals who are gonna help you
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.880]   in a really difficult time.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.640]   And don't be surprised if you have elderly parents
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.360]   that it could take a very long time,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   at least with my parents,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.400]   there's still so much of their own death files
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.320]   that I've requested that they still haven't done.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   I've tried all kinds of things to not bribe them,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.240]   but essentially motivate them to get them done,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.160]   and it's like pulling teeth, they just don't wanna do it.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.100]   And I understand it's not something pleasant to do,
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.820]   but even as important as it is,
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.140]   it can take a very long time,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.860]   and it takes a lot of patience on our part
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.860]   to help them along and get them to work on it.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.780]   It's not easy.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.220]   - And if you're a parent,
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.140]   I think we should all take the responsibility
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.660]   to work on these files,
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.300]   and get our estate clearly organized,
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.920]   and who to contact if something were to happen.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.380]   Because this is a gift of love to our beneficiaries,
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.940]   our children, our relatives, our loved ones.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.660]   Sydney and I, we spent the pandemic
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.500]   getting new term life insurance policies,
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.460]   20-year term policies,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.740]   matching policies with the same amount of death benefits.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.820]   And we also spend time putting together
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.460]   our respective death files.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.220]   And so we should be set,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.540]   and this is because we're thinking about our kids,
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.260]   and just in case something happens.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.380]   So in terms of Japan, how was Japan?
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.820]   Was it busy, hot?
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.620]   Was it back to normal, international travel post-pandemic?
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.940]   - Yeah, I hadn't been back in more than 10 years, I think.
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.020]   And normally July is hot, but not as crazy hot as August.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.300]   But this year the heat came early.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   So it was about 98, 99 degrees every day I was there,
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.000]   and humid.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.980]   In the evenings you'd get a little bit of breeze,
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.580]   which would help cool things down.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.300]   But walking with my mom at a slow pace due to her age,
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.300]   and using a cane in the summer heat there was tough.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.620]   So while I was with her, I had to stay very patient,
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.860]   and I tried to keep her indoors as much as possible.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.640]   And then I had to do a lot of things independently from her
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.660]   to keep her out of the heat.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.140]   So coming from San Francisco,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.100]   it was quite a shock to have such an extreme change
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.300]   in temperature 'cause San Francisco summers are very mild
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.700]   and actually quite cold.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.700]   And in terms of busyness, Tokyo is as busy,
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.740]   it felt as busy as it ever was.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.000]   People are out using the trains, the buses, going to work,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.980]   out and about, it felt normal.
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.980]   It didn't feel unusually slow or anything like that.
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.340]   So it was good to be back,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.300]   but also I'm happy to be home again.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.240]   - Would you ever wanna live in Tokyo?
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.700]   Like let's say when our daughter turns five or older,
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.420]   you know, we had the opportunity to slow travel
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.880]   for months on end, maybe years on end,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.100]   what do you think about sending them
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.220]   to international school in Tokyo?
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.620]   - I would not want to live there.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.780]   It's fun to visit and have a vacation there,
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.460]   especially if you can go off peak when the weather is better
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.860]   and there's less people.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.100]   Japan can get very, very crowded.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.560]   And it's just not the type of lifestyle that I want.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.240]   I like slower pace, I like less people.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   And Tokyo is just, it's a place where you have to
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.920]   go through really long commutes.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.280]   For example, I saw my friend
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.640]   who I've known since kindergarten,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.680]   she moved back to Japan a couple of years ago
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.620]   and her daughter has to commute an hour to school one way.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.200]   Granted, she is going to an international school,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.580]   which is going to be farther away.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.360]   She's eight years old and she does this all by herself.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.760]   One hour to school every day all by herself.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.700]   - Well, that's actually good.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.280]   Well, toughens her up.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.520]   - Yes.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.640]   You know, if she was going to a local Japanese school,
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.360]   she wouldn't have to travel so far.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.040]   But you know, if we were going to do
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.080]   the international school thing,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.000]   it would be a lot of commuting.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.400]   - Well, not if we lived close to the international school.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.360]   - Well, yes, but there's all kinds of pros and cons
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.640]   and whatnot that we probably don't have time
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.560]   to get into today.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.680]   But it's not the type of lifestyle
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.120]   that I would want for our family.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.000]   - Interesting.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.680]   One of the things, I lived in Kobe, Osaka, Kobe,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.300]   when I was six years old for a couple years.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.560]   And I loved my time there.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.800]   The food is amazing, the adventure was amazing.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   But I don't know if it's because I was six, seven years old,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.280]   which is why the world was amazing.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.840]   But when I went back to Tokyo,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.200]   this was during college years,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.920]   and see some of my friends,
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.360]   I thought it was expensive.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   However, now, as income earning adults with net worth,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.640]   versus being a student having nothing,
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.560]   it doesn't seem that expensive now.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.400]   Did you feel that Tokyo was expensive
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.380]   or inexpensive when you went back?
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.720]   - I mean, I don't know anything about
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   the current cost of living expenses there.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.040]   In terms of food, which is what I had the most exposure to,
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.840]   food is reasonable.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.280]   Again, the friend that I met with said
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.680]   they spend less money on food than they did
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.600]   when they were living in LA.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.040]   And not only do they save money,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.080]   the quality of the food is better.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.240]   - Yeah.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.640]   - Which is true. - The food is so good.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.200]   - The food in Japan is very good.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.400]   Even little small places that you'll find
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.760]   in the alleyways and whatnot, it's very good.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.120]   And even their produce, I find,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.720]   is much fresher, much tastier
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.680]   than in the US.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.560]   Very good produce in Japan.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.040]   - Like the kyoho grapes and the pears
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.680]   and the peaches and nectarines,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.040]   and the yakiniku, oh my goodness.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.480]   What was interesting, you got me a shirt
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.120]   from the airport with Mount Fuji on it.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.800]   I was like, oh, thank you for the shirt.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.720]   And it said 1,500 yen,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.760]   and I think the exchange rate is like 135 to one.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   - Well, when I left, it was about 140.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.600]   When I was going there as a kid,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.920]   it was about one to 100.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.640]   So it's much better now in terms of
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.160]   how far you can stretch a US dollar.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.480]   - Right, right, yeah, so 1,500 yen,
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.040]   I was like, oh, that's like 11 bucks.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.160]   That's so cheap for a T-shirt,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.520]   'cause here in the States,
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.040]   the cheapest T-shirt would be like 20 bucks.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.640]   Maybe $25. - In a lot of places,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.400]   yeah, in a lot of places.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.280]   - Was everything digital,
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.840]   or did you still use the hyaku-yen coins
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.960]   for the train and all that?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.720]   - I used some cash and coins for little things,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.080]   but I really didn't need cash.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   I got a mobile transit card before I left the US,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.320]   and I used that every time I went in
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.480]   and out of the train stations.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.200]   It automatically calculates the cost of your trip
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.880]   and any transfers that you take.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.560]   Super easy, very, very efficient,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.200]   very technology-forward country.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   So it's great to be able to get around very easily.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   The public transportation system in Japan is phenomenal.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.360]   Very accurate in terms of timeliness,
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.040]   very clean, very reliable.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.520]   - Yeah, and this Pass,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.840]   do you just download it on Apple or something?
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.680]   How does that work?
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.360]   - Yeah, well, the one that I used is called a Suica,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.620]   S-U-I-C-A, a Suica card.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.420]   They also have Passmo is another very popular one.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.220]   And I just got mine hooked up through Apple Pay
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.420]   and through the Apple Wallet system.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.780]   The only catch was I had to use a MasterCard for some reason.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.900]   Visa doesn't work very well, at least US-based cards.
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.660]   Amex, US Amex also works, so that's what my sister had to use.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.660]   Little tiny things like that, but it was very easy,
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.840]   and you just basically top up your card
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.020]   through Apple Wallet when your balance starts to run low.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.180]   - This is an app on your phone, not a card card?
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.340]   - Well, it's basically like a mobile transit card.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.340]   You can get a physical card as well
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.340]   if you go to the airport or a train station.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.440]   - So it's like an app?
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.580]   - Essentially, yeah, it's like a digital card
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.600]   that you use through your Apple Wallet.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.500]   - Got it, got it.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.740]   Okay, so it sounds like the whole trip was a success.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.240]   Very productive, do you feel less stressed
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.600]   now that you're home?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.400]   - I do feel less stressed, and I'm just trying to,
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   tether my mom, I don't know if that's the right word,
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.400]   but basically just remind her how much we did accomplish,
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.240]   and the rest will just be sorted out over time.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.080]   - Got it, got it.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.920]   Are there any things you learned about yourself
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.440]   that you didn't really realize from this trip?
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.040]   Because I have a lot of things to share about myself.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.740]   - I didn't have any huge epiphanies.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.460]   I mean, it was a nice reminder how easy it is
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.980]   to travel independently or without children.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.460]   And I felt very safe traveling through the airports
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.820]   and the airplanes in terms of COVID.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.140]   I didn't have any fears of getting sick,
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.780]   or everything felt like it was pre-pandemic,
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.980]   which was a nice experience to kind of have that
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.900]   out of the way.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.200]   And yeah, traveling by myself was quite easy.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.640]   - Yeah, I bet it was.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.440]   You don't have to pack too much.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   - Exactly, I just had a backpack and a carry-on,
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.320]   that's all I had, it was very easy.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.720]   - Yeah.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.740]   Well, I wanted to share some of my perspective
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.560]   from you being away, because I was at home
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.680]   with two children, we had some help at night
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.200]   and in the morning sometimes.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.180]   But I wanted to share some perspectives
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.960]   for those who kind of fear being alone,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.880]   raising your children without a significant other there.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.260]   Because you have, I don't think,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.800]   except for the birth of our daughter,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.600]   you haven't been away from any child,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.400]   actually, since you were giving birth,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.560]   you haven't been away from any child
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.400]   for six years and six and a half years.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.000]   So they've been used to me being there all the time.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.080]   So this was, we were both a little nervous
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.340]   about how they would react.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.680]   Our son handled it super well.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.800]   He has been like, bye mommy, see you later,
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.700]   I'm gonna go play.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.280]   It was harder for our daughter, she's still very attached.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.880]   But I think overall she handled it well.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.640]   - She did, yeah, not bad.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.620]   So I wanted to say that I was a little bit afraid,
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.980]   I guess, how things would go with just me.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.520]   But I'm pleased to say that after five nights and six days,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.580]   things went smoothly.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.800]   And I think it went a little bit better than expected.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.100]   And as a result, I have more confidence as a father
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.560]   to take care of the kids by myself
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.160]   and with some help when I need to.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.560]   And so that was a real big plus,
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.760]   because you really don't know how well you can perform
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.960]   until you're faced with that situation.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.400]   So face that fear, do it,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.580]   and I think you'll gain a lot of confidence.
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.160]   The other thing I learned was that
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.460]   when there's no other option,
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.520]   the work actually gets easier.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.340]   So when I say no other option,
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.000]   for example, let's say I pick up the kids after school
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.440]   and I play with them for an hour and I'm just tired.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.640]   So the option is to say,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.720]   hey, can you guys go play with mommy?
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.460]   And then they will.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.700]   And I can just veg out on the phone
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.700]   or write a post or something.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.020]   And I'm just chill.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.400]   But when I have no other option,
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.740]   when there's nobody else to take care of them,
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.300]   I can't relax in the sense,
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.180]   but I also can't just slip off my responsibility as someone.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.020]   I just have to do it.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.300]   So when you know that you have to do it,
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.740]   you build this muscle where it gets easier
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.160]   and easier over time.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.220]   So by the fourth night, fifth night,
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.580]   I was like rocking and rolling.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.060]   I knew what to do.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.620]   And I had the confidence and courage to do it.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.260]   And so it just kept going.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.100]   And this is a parallel to how the kids reacted
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.700]   while you were away.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.660]   Because when they were gone,
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.960]   they were much less whiny, complained much less,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.500]   and didn't cry as much as all.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.700]   I think they only cried once when there was some small fight.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.620]   - Right, when I was away, they were better behaved.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.580]   - Right, exactly.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.300]   They were better behaved.
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   And the epiphany there is,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.140]   I think they also realized the next day,
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.700]   mommy wasn't coming back until Saturday.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.060]   And so when they had no other option,
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.900]   they said, well, you know what,
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.260]   there's no point in whining and complaining
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.420]   and fighting for love and intention.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.380]   They just got to get on with it, right?
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.460]   And so this is really important, I think,
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.700]   as a lesson for all of us,
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.380]   trying to face challenges and hardships,
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.060]   that when you have no other option,
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.500]   it's just that one choice, actually embrace it.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.520]   Because the only thing you can do is go forward.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.180]   There's no distractions, you know?
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.980]   There's no 10 opportunity choices
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.000]   that's gonna cause you to think and wonder,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.180]   should I do this or that?
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.940]   You just have to do one thing.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.840]   And I think that's really relieving.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.540]   Now, what do you think?
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.100]   - Yeah, I can see that.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.300]   I had a prediction that with me away,
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.620]   they would be a lot better behaved,
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.220]   there wouldn't be so many fights and crying and screaming,
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.860]   and that I also predicted that the day I would get back,
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.500]   all hell would break loose,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.040]   and the whole week's worth of pent up emotions
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.300]   in their little bodies would just kinda let loose
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.940]   and explode, and that is actually what happened,
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.700]   which is pretty funny.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.700]   I remember texting you. - With our daughter, right?
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.040]   - I remember texting you, the screaming has started,
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.100]   like when they were with me,
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.260]   they just started attacking each other.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.620]   But again, this doesn't happen all the time.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.180]   Things were much better the second day that I was back.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.500]   But yeah, they tend to be very emotional with me,
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.500]   and less so with you.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.460]   But it all works out, it all works out.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.300]   - Right.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.140]   (laughing)
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.700]   And here's another epiphany for creators,
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.980]   and actually for all spouses or people in relationships.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.060]   And so every time I write a post,
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.140]   it takes hour and a half, two and a half hours to write,
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.020]   and after I'm done, I feel very proud.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.620]   And especially after I press publish,
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.680]   I'm excited to see what the community
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.700]   will think about the post,
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.460]   whether they'll comment or share or get upset
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.860]   or be really laudatory.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.960]   It's just the way it is as a writer.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.460]   As a writer, you just wanna be read,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.420]   and as, let's say, a podcaster, you wanna be heard,
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.240]   and as a videographer, you wanna be seen.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.920]   And so I know that every time I write a post,
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.720]   I text you and I say, oh, I finished this great post
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.520]   on this great topic that came to me.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.020]   And the reason why I do that is because you're my rock,
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.140]   and you're my cheerleader and support system,
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.380]   and I depend on you for support.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.880]   Because when you're putting yourself out there, folks,
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.900]   sometimes you can get attacked, right?
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.900]   And the more opinionated you are,
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.460]   the more you're gonna get attacked.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.140]   And so this is one of the reasons why
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.060]   you see a lot of vanilla content out there,
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.820]   because people get tired of getting attacked all the time,
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.600]   even though their intentions are good,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.720]   even though they come up with some reasonable explanations
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.320]   for why they think the way they do.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.020]   And so when you were gone,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:42.520]   I just didn't seek fulfillment,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.240]   not fulfillment, approval anymore,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.360]   because during the day here in San Francisco
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.720]   was nighttime in Tokyo, and vice versa.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.440]   And so I just sucked it up.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.200]   I said, well, nobody's here to praise me or anything,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.300]   or support me, I'm just gonna keep my head down
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.600]   and go, go, go.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.900]   And what I realized also is that it is kind of a burden.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.620]   It's a heavy responsibility for any couple,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.640]   any person in a relationship,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.100]   to provide constant support,
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.680]   and you can do it, and encouragement.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.600]   You know, I think some of us
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.120]   have higher self-esteems than others.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.200]   Some of us want more encouragement than others.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.680]   And I didn't realize how much
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.420]   I had relied on you for support.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.360]   So first of all, I really appreciate that.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.200]   After all these years.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.560]   And second of all, I think I need to look inward more
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.640]   and actually be more quiet,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.240]   and just write because I wanna write,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.400]   and actually not bother you so much,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.200]   because you're always busy doing other things.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.920]   - Well, what I will add is that
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.080]   I'm not that great over text,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.540]   and I'm even worse over email.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.300]   And a lot of times we're on opposite schedules, right?
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.300]   When you're working, and writing, and doing things.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.340]   I am with the kids,
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.340]   and so you tend to send these messages over text,
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.380]   and while they're coming in,
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.900]   I'm like, you know, in the bathroom,
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.860]   helping the kids go potty, or making their food.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.820]   My mind is very frazzled and distracted,
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.660]   and I'm not as good as I could be
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.620]   in terms of pausing what I'm doing,
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.760]   and looking at those messages,
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.740]   and acknowledging and appreciating
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.780]   everything that you're doing
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.260]   on the other side of the house
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.920]   while I'm doing these things.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.420]   So I think, I just thought of this right now,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.100]   I'm much better in person,
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.220]   so we just need to do more of these conversations
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.140]   and catch-ups when we're together in person,
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.580]   and the kids aren't distracting.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.060]   'Cause my mind, you know me,
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.340]   my mind gets very frazzled very easily,
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.860]   and I get distracted and lose track of things easily.
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.020]   - It's called the mental load.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.220]   There's like this great comic strip
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.160]   about this mother doing so much work,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.100]   and maybe the husband said,
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.760]   can you just do this and that?
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.300]   And it was just like these little things,
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.620]   they sound little, but when you add them up,
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.860]   the mental load gets huge,
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.260]   and it can overflow and become super burdensome.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.380]   But yeah, communication is so important in any relationship.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.780]   I was watching something online,
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.240]   and it was talking about how unsaid expectations
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.260]   are what crush relationships.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.780]   So again, unspoken expectations.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.860]   So first of all, if you expect the world
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.820]   of your partner or someone,
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.020]   that is really dangerous,
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.740]   because if you expect 99% performance,
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.980]   and they give you 98% performance,
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.280]   you will be disappointed in their performance, right?
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.140]   So expectations is one thing,
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.700]   you gotta manage your expectations
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.220]   of what you can expect in terms of support, love,
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.860]   attention, all that stuff from your partner.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.060]   And at the same time, you need to speak your expectations,
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.820]   and you can't expect your significant other
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.060]   to read your mind.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.940]   So-- - Yeah.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.860]   I think the more we have,
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.340]   more in terms of us and other couples
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.100]   have in-person communication, the better.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.780]   We all forget how reliant we are on our phones.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.780]   And communicating over a text message and emails,
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.340]   it's just really not the same.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:36.300]   So much can get lost in the shuffle.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.580]   Even just text messages.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.460]   That's why I do like how Apple added the reply feature
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.220]   to their iMessage.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.600]   'Cause sometimes you get,
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.100]   well you might get 10 text messages from somebody,
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.660]   and there might be three questions thrown in there.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.460]   And if you're trying to reply,
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.660]   you might forget what you're responding to
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.600]   for something earlier.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.620]   So you can click on, let's say,
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.500]   the first question in a chain of 10,
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.980]   and you can reply to that specific message
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.580]   so that the recipient knows what you're talking about.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.620]   It's just a little tiny thing. - Got it.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.780]   Oh, okay. - But in terms of--
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.900]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.180]   Reply to a specific message, yes, yes.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.000]   - Right, right, right.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.780]   'Cause so much gets lost in the shuffle.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.540]   We're all so busy doing so many things at once.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.620]   And digital communication is super convenient,
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:28.380]   but it's also not as great
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.460]   as in-person communication a lot of times.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.060]   Or video, you know?
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.740]   - And this is another point.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.500]   If you do, your example is 10 text messages.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.260]   So the chances are higher that the other person's
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.100]   gonna miss one or two points.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.940]   And it's the same thing with crafting an argument.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.120]   Let's say if you have 10 reasons why,
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   it kinda dilutes the reasoning
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.280]   versus if you had three reasons why
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.900]   you should do this, this, or that.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.120]   So that's something to work on.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.160]   And communication is something that I've been trying
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.640]   to work on as much as possible.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.040]   It was my favorite class in business school,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.760]   communications class.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.680]   And as a writer, and now as a regular podcaster,
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.160]   I'm trying to speak more clearly,
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.800]   deliver more clear, concise prose
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.680]   so that people can understand better
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.920]   because if I'm talking over people, then I'm failing.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   So I thought, in conclusion,
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.520]   this was a great conversation to catch up
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.880]   and I'm glad you're back.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.380]   It seems like it went really quickly.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.220]   What do you think?
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.680]   - On my side, it did because of the time change
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.520]   getting there, right?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.880]   I basically lost a day, lost two days almost
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.840]   because I left here midday Monday.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.560]   It didn't really get settled until Tuesday evening.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.920]   So, and then, yeah.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.140]   And then I was leaving already Saturday morning.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.800]   So it went fast.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.440]   - Oh, this is one other thing,
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.720]   another realization of you being gone.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.000]   'Cause we're seldom not apart
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.840]   because you're at home, I'm at home, we don't travel.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.080]   We're always together.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.760]   - We work from home too.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.260]   - So yeah, the biggest, the other cool realization,
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.480]   so I've been a very focused and serious
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.160]   stay-at-home father since 2017, since our son was born.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.920]   But man, it has been tough being second fiddle since 2017.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.780]   For, I would say, at least three and a half years,
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.280]   I was second fiddle to our son.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.020]   He always would run to you or want you.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.540]   And same thing with our daughter.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.060]   I've been, you know, just kinda like chopped liver
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.340]   many times and I've written about that.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.440]   And so, one of the positives of you being away
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.260]   was that finally, ah, it was me.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.700]   I was number one.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.900]   - You got all the love.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.120]   - I got all the love.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.100]   They ran to me, they gave me the hugs,
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.220]   they gave me the kisses, they said, "I love you, Daddy."
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.780]   So that was an amazing, amazing feeling.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.020]   - Yeah, yeah, it's hard.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.540]   Kids can be so loving and they can also be so cruel
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.180]   at the same time, you know?
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.100]   There've been a few occasions when they've rejected me,
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.380]   but definitely not that many.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.460]   And I know it's been hard on you so many times
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.140]   when all you wanna do is play with them
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.740]   and they're like, "No, I wanna do this with Mommy instead."
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.660]   It's hard to hear that.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.740]   - It is hard to hear that.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.820]   And this is one of the reasons why, folks,
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.700]   that I wanna go back to work once our daughter
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.580]   is in school full-time in the fall of 2023.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.520]   Because then, once that happens,
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.860]   I've got eight hours of free time, right?
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.420]   And I can't play pickleball and tennis all day.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.460]   I wanna fulfill my time.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.580]   Yes, I can spend time writing a book,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.940]   recording podcasts, FS,
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.060]   but I do miss that camaraderie with other people.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.660]   I do miss having a nice, steady paycheck.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.140]   It'd be nice to have healthcare benefits.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.060]   It seems like a more efficient path.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.380]   So many times over the past six and a half years,
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.160]   I've thought about going back to work
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.620]   because it was hard being the second fiddle
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.820]   stay-at-home parent.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.740]   It really is hard.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.780]   So for mothers out there who have fathers
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.700]   who wanna be stay-at-home parents, who are trying,
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.100]   we're trying.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   And a lot of times, the return,
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.180]   the quote, "return on an effort,"
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.300]   isn't there because of the innocent
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.060]   and honest rebuffs of our children.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.260]   And so, I've got to this point,
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.340]   and we'll see whether I get that job or figure it out.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.940]   I mean, what are your thoughts on that?
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.700]   - I mean, I know you very well,
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.400]   and I think, while it might sound great,
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.980]   I think the reality of it might not be
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.100]   as wonderful as you might be imagining.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.420]   And I think you work a lot more
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.180]   than you give yourself credit for.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.520]   You work very, very hard.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.400]   And for those readers out there
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.300]   who have never written a blog before or run a website,
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.980]   it takes a lot of time.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.460]   Sam works so hard, you guys.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.660]   It takes a lot to run a website.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.640]   And we're all very, very appreciative
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.200]   of everything that you do.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.240]   So you definitely need to give yourself more credit.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.200]   And don't forget how much it used to annoy you
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.120]   at your old job when you had to go
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.360]   to all of those meetings about meetings.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.120]   - Oh, but I-- - Meetings about meetings.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.520]   - But I feel like I could be a meeting sit-downer expert.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.720]   Just go in there, pretend you're listening,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.680]   and then nod your head, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.840]   And then-- - Yeah.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.760]   - And then like-- - Maybe you'd--
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.240]   - That's it. - Maybe you'd have fun
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.060]   with that for like a month, and then you'd be like,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.640]   why am I here wasting my time?
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.760]   I wanna be doing this.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   I could be so much more efficient and, yeah.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.240]   - I don't know. - Maybe.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.280]   - Maybe, maybe not.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.220]   I've been inspired by many of the techies that I've met
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.840]   during the middle of the weekdays playing pickleball.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.720]   - Right.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.160]   - They're making good money, and they're having fun.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.760]   And I'm like, how many hours a week do you guys work?
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.320]   It's like, yeah, like 20 to 25, 30.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.040]   And they make multiple six figures.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.360]   And I'm like, wow, that sounds pretty good to me,
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.840]   but unfortunately I have no technical skills.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.240]   So, that will be tough.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.640]   But it always seems, you know,
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.240]   grass is always greener on the other side.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.760]   - Grass is always greener.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.840]   - Alrighty, folks, well, that's our latest catch-up.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.720]   Sydney and me, I hope you liked it.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.480]   If you enjoyed this podcast, we'd love a share, a review.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   It helps keep us going.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.200]   A lot more episodes in the future.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.700]   Also, just on the audio stuff in the future,
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.180]   I'm doing my best to figure out
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.340]   how to get the best audio quality possible.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.520]   Sometimes it's not possible because of the technical setups
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.420]   or the Wi-Fi of the guests on the other side.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.600]   Hopefully this audio setup right now
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.640]   with this interview is really good
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.600]   because we're in the same house with the same Wi-Fi system.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.240]   So just bear with me, folks.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.740]   Hopefully the content is what matters most.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.960]   I'm just a one-man band sourcing the interviewees.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.200]   Recording, doing the show notes,
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.960]   doing a little bit of editing, not really,
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   and putting it all together.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.200]   So keep in touch, folks.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.360]   Please subscribe to the Financial Samurai newsletter

[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.440]   Take care. - Bye, everybody.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.600]   (silence)
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.760]   (silence)
