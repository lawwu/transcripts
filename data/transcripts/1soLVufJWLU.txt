[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   What's harder, perception or control for these problems?
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.320]   So being able to perfectly perceive everything or figuring out a plan once you perceive everything,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.600]   how to interact with all the agents in the environment.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   In your sense, from a learning perspective, is perception or action harder in that giant,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.280]   beautiful, multi-task learning neural network?
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.520]   The hardest thing is having accurate representation of the physical objects in vector space.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:37.020]   So taking the visual input, primarily visual input, some sonar and radar, and then creating
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.160]   an accurate vector space representation of the objects around you.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.200]   Once you have an accurate vector space representation, the planning and control is relatively easier.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.480]   That is relatively easy.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.160]   Basically once you have accurate vector space representation, then you're kind of like a
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   video game.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.240]   Cars in Grand Theft Auto or something, they work pretty well.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.680]   They drive down the road, they don't crash, pretty much, unless you crash into them.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   That's because they've got an accurate vector space representation of where the cars are,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.920]   and then rendering that as the output.
