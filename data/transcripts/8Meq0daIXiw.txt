[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 189.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I'm here in the Deep Work HQ along with my producer Jesse.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Jesse, I'm not in great shape as I've told you.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   I'm still battling a sickness.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   My family was passing around.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   You probably hear it in my voice.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So our goal is to get through today's episode and Thursday's episode,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   which we're recording back to back without me losing my voice or passing out.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Now if the latter thing happens, Jesse, you've got to just jump in heroically
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and just push the show through.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I'll mimic your voice and I'll finish off the podcast.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   You've got to mimic my voice and finish off the podcast.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I'll sit in your chair and I'll put you over on the floor.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Just prop me up in a blonde wig like a Weekend at Bernie's thing.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   What are you talking about? The Scarecrow? That's what I'll do.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Exactly. Yes, there'll be a Cal Scare-- or a Jesse Scarecrow.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   You'll have to do the voice when we cut to it, your own voice.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And then for me, yeah, I'm easy to imitate.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Just deep, deep, deep, email, email, email, Facebook bad,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   you misunderstand Deep Work, blah, blah, blah.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   All right, easy to do.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   All right, so speaking of the show,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   quick administrative announcement about YouTube.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We're changing something up about our YouTube channel,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We are going to post fewer videos.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So the original idea was that we were posting
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   not just the full episodes in video format on YouTube,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   we were also posting an individual video for every question and segment.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   It turns out that from the perspective of people who use YouTube,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   that's way too many videos.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So now what we're going to do is still release the video
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   for the full episode of every episode that we record,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   along with a handful of videos of individual questions or segments
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   that seemed particularly interesting.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It turns out there's two class of people
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   that interact with this show on YouTube.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   There's people, this was the audience we had in mind at first,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   who listened to it on the podcast,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   but maybe occasionally there's a particular question
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   they liked the answer for,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and they wanted to go back and be able to find it and share it,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   so they could go to the YouTube channel to find and share that question.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And then there's this other group of YouTube users,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   which seems to be by far the bigger group,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   that we didn't realize this at the time,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   of people who just prefer to use YouTube to consume the podcast.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And so for that second group,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   they were just being completely overwhelmed
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   by having every question turned into a video.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So we decided to serve them,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   because for the people who want to occasionally go
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and find a question I answered,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Jesse has put these very good, what are they called, chapters?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yeah, so if you look at the description of the video of each full episode,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   every question is written in the description with a link,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and you can click on that link to jump straight to that part of the video.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And then if you do that, the URL is now,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   if I understand this right, Jesse, the URL now has that time up in it.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So if you share that URL with someone or you bookmark that URL,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   you were bookmarking the video starting at exactly that point.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So it turns out the full video with good chaptering,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   solve that problem of occasionally people listening on the podcast app
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   would want to go just bookmark a particular question,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   while having fewer videos overall,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   means that for those who like to just listen to the podcast online,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   they're not having the episodes be buried in all these individual question emails.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Also, I think it was possible that Jesse's eyes were going to melt.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I think having to look at that many hours of Cal Newport talking about these topics,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   there's a lot of videos, Jesse, that you were sort of up to your neck in editing.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So I think that's a hidden benefit.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Yeah, it was good. It was good, though.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Good videos. We're learning as we go along.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Learning as we go.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Speaking of learning as we go, I figured let's do a new segment,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   which I'm tentatively calling Cal Reacts to the News.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And the idea is simple.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Let's just take a news article that I came across I thought was interesting,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and we will talk about it.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So in today's Cal Reacts to the News segment,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I want to talk about a lot of articles talking about the same event,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   which is the New York Times, and in particular, I believe it was their executive editor,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Dean Bequet, I don't really know how to say his name,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   sending out a series of memos to the New York Times reporter saying,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   essentially, stop using Twitter so much.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Let me quote from the article that I grabbed.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It was from the Nieman Lab at Harvard.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So the Nieman Lab at Harvard is like a journalism watchdog type organization,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   so that foundation writes good articles about stuff that's happening in media.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So in this article from Joshua Benton at the Nieman Lab at Harvard,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   he starts by saying, enough with all the tweeting already.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   That's how I'd summarize the New York Times new guidelines on how a journalist use Twitter.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   This morning in a series of memos from executive editor Dean Bequet,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I'm for sure saying that wrong, and deputy managing editor Cliff Levy,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   the Times made it clear that it would like staffers to shoo away from the little bird,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   the little blue bird on their phones, or at least not feed it as often.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Okay, now if you go deeper into this article,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   and this is the best one of the various articles I read, this one from Nieman Lab was the best.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   If you go into this article, they pull out three different reasons
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   given by the Times for why they want their employees to use Twitter less or stop using it altogether.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   One is harassment. They think it makes it easier for the reporters to be subjected to online harassment.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Twitter is conducive to that.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Two is distraction.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   They do not write as well if they're spending all of their time on this heavily emotionally engaging and distracting medium.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And three is influence on their reporting.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   There is an echo chamber effect.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I think that exact terminology might have even been used.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I guess Dean Bequet called it echo chambers.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   He said we can become overly focused on how Twitter will react to our work to the detriment of our mission and independence.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So it's a third complaint.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   If you're on Twitter all the time, it can really affect what you write about as a reporter
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   in a way that's maybe not representative of what you should be writing about
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   or how the whole nation as a whole feels about something.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And so they said you don't have to leave Twitter,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   but there had been an informal mandatory Twitter policy at the New York Times.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It was heavily, heavily encouraged.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And now they're saying that's no longer the case, and we're really good if you don't want to use it at all.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   So those are their three reasons.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   There's also a fourth reason they don't say, which I'll get to in a second,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   but is also another big reason why they're saying this, they're just not admitting it.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So we'll get to that in a second.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   But let's react briefly to those three reasons.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And let me start by saying, and I am going to say this with all triumph, I told you so.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So if you go back to my 2016 book, Deep Work,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   in that book I talk specifically about the development that happened at the New York Times.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   This was right around 2014, 2015, I believe, when I was working on that book,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   where the New York Times got very serious about Twitter.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   This was an era where they initiated what they called the social media desk at the New York Times,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and that desk began to heavily pressure their reporters to be on Twitter and to use Twitter.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And I reacted to that in Deep Work and said,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   "It is a bad idea for the New York Times to pressure their reporters to use Twitter."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   So I called this shot, I called it when they started doing this,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   that they were going to regret that move, that this was going to cause problems.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Now, I have to lower my triumph because I would say the details of my critique
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   were maybe less prescient than they could have been.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   I was focused mainly on the distraction issue.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I highlighted one of the reporters at the Times who had just won the Pulitzer Prize
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   for her reporting out of, I believe, the Paris Bureau,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and I made this case that here's someone who is doing fantastic work for the paper
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   by cultivating long-term relationships with sources overseas,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   by marinating herself in the reality and nuances of this news environment,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and from there being able to produce these long, intricate, and incredibly revealing articles
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   about what was happening in this part of the world.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   She won the paper a Pulitzer for it, and I argued,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   "Who benefits if she has to instead be on Twitter?"
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Because this is going to cause her to constantly be context-shifting,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   this is going to cause her to get involved in emotional entanglements
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   and arguments and psychological torment online.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It would objectively make her worse at doing this type of reporting.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   How is that possibly a good trade-off for, what, more retweets online
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   or slightly more attention from that small, very narrow crowd that is engaged
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   in reporter interactions online, that they see the word "New York Times" more often?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I was like, "This does not make sense. I think this is a bad idea."
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   At the time, again, that was probably considered regressive.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Now, what is this, six years later, the New York Times is basically saying,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   "No, you're right. That is a problem."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Now, I missed the other two things, but they're worth focusing on.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Their Haasman issue is a big one, but I'm going to generalize that.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Let's generalize that beyond very specific and intense cases of,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   "I'm really harassing you," in a way that has legal ramifications,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   and just talk about the psychological harm of Twitter interaction.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   These reporters are having their brains scrambled by having to be a part of these
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   incredibly frustrating, highly partisan back-and-forth fights,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   completely interspersed with bots that are jumping in there and just trolling
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   in the middle of the melee.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   This makes you anxious and miserable and stressed.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I recently talked to a New York Times reporter I know about this,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   who absolutely validated that. It's a massive source of anxiety and stress.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Even if you look beyond just, "This person is being harassed by a legitimate
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   security threat-style stalker," just normal Twitter behavior,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   especially in the sphere of news reporting, is psychologically incredibly damaging.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   That's a lot to have to expose someone to.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   It's hard to do your job or even live your life when you are being exposed
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   to that type of back-and-forth.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   The influence issue, that's another one that I didn't predict when I wrote
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Deep Work because, again, the nature of social media was different in that era.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I was writing that book largely in 2015.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But I think that came to be a really big issue.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   What brought that to my attention, probably most prominently,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   was when Barry Weiss resigned from the New York Times,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I think this might have been in 2018, citing their perceived illiberalism.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   For people who don't remember, Barry Weiss, she's a slightly right-of-center reporter.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   She was at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   After Trump won in 2016, the then-editor of the Op-Ed page,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   the opinion editor for the New York Times, said, "We missed this completely.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Our newsroom had no idea this was even a possibility.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   We must be out of touch with big swaths of the country,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   so we need to bring in more conservative voices."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Now, they didn't go out and get fire-breathing conservative voices.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   They brought on Bret Stephens. They brought on Barry Weiss.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   These were people that were barely kind of to the right-of-center, but whatever.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   They brought them in.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It took about two years before Barry was gone, that the opinion editor was gone.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   They drove him out for publishing the Tom Cotton Op-Ed
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   about using military force to help disperse protesters,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   which is a very bad thing to do, unless it's the Canadian trucker protesters.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Then it's a very good thing to do. The whole thing's very confusing.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   But anyways, Barry got pushed out, and she said in her letter,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   she wrote a letter to the publisher of the New York Times,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and one of the things she said was, "Twitter is not on the masthead of the New York Times,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   but it might as well be. It is the ultimate editor."
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   That was a really revealing moment.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   What she was trying to say is, people are writing their articles
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   with Twitter as their ultimate audience.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   What is going to be celebrated by my team on Twitter?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   What is not going to bring the approbation from my team on Twitter?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   What's going to best help me take my turn at the plate,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   taking a swing against the other teams on Twitter?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   The very small number of people who actively use Twitter,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   which is very small, there's something like 15 million active Twitter users in the US,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   and then an even smaller percentage of them that are actually using it a lot to do political dialogue.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   It's a very small, non-representative group of people,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   but they're having this huge influence on what was being written.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   This is not an issue just with press.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   That very small group of very active people on Twitter
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   also had a huge influence on politics,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   because a lot of politicians, their staffers are young,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   their staffers were living on Twitter,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and so you were seeing a lot of political movements being influenced by Twitter.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I was just at a talk the other day by a philosopher who studies technology,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and she was pointing out, and this is scary,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   the degree to which now you see people on the floor of Congress,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and I think people can know what examples I'm talking about here,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   who are now just straight up performing for an incredibly small subset of their constituents
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   that are active on Twitter.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   They're just directly performing for that small Twitter.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   There's a photo going around during the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   purportedly of Ted Cruz checking his Twitter reactions on Twitter under the desk
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   right after he was done with his confirmation.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   So Twitter is having this huge outsized influence,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and it's so few people who are on it, and it's so non-representative.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And so the New York Times is realizing this.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   If we are writing to support our team, a very small team on Twitter,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   which is non-representative even of the people who read the New York Times,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   that's a problem.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   The New York Times should not be a system
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   that's just trying to help people write good tweets or what have you.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   So these were all problems they pointed out, and they all seemed like they were good problems.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And they're all problems I would take seriously.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And I think it's very smart that if these three things are going on,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   that you start telling your reporters, "Stop using Twitter."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Or if you do use it, use it a lot less often.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And I think it's a very important culture shift,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   because it was until just a minute ago at the New York Times
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   considered near mandatory to use those technologies.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   All right, so I mentioned there was a fourth mystery reason
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   unstated by the Times, but I think is looming over these decisions.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And the other thing I think is going on here, this is the more cynical take,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   is they are trying to get the balance of power
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   away from the individual reporters and back towards the paper.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   So we can think of this as the Taylor-Lawrence issue.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   There's this big fight going on online right now
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   between Taylor-Lawrence and Maggie Haberman.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   So Taylor's a technology reporter who just moved to the Post from the Times,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and Maggie Haberman's a longstanding White House reporter for the New York Times.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And they're having a fight about the role of things like Twitter
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and the need for writers to have their own brands.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   But anyways, the TL;DR version of this is Taylor, who is younger,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I think she's more my age or younger,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   is from the school of thought of you as a writer have to have your own brand,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   and you have your own audience you have access to,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   and you use social media platforms primarily to feed and connect with this audience.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And your job at the New York Times, your job at the Washington Post,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   is just like a platform that helps gives you credibility
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   and makes it easier for you to build that audience.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   But what matters is that you build your audience.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And this is what Barry Weiss did.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   So when she left the New York Times, she wasn't stressing about her bank account
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   because she went and started her own media company
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   built around a sub stack newsletter and a podcast that's bringing in millions.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   She's doing very well with that, much better than she was doing at the New York Times.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And so Taylor and Maggie were having this fight where Maggie's like,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   the reporting is what matters.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Don't waste all this time trying to build online audiences
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   and interacting with them and fighting online
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   and being a part of the online cultural discussion, write really good articles.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And Taylor's like, that's naive. This is the way things happen.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Without taking a side in that fight, I would assume the New York Times
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   likes the Maggie perspective because it's much better for them
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   if their reporters, in other hands, are putting the paper first
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   and not their own individual personal brands
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   because then they become too good for the paper.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   They're too big for the paper. They leave.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   They also get involved in big, splashy fights.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Taylor gets involved in a lot of these things
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and it can be distracting and negative for the paper.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   They maybe like the model of just look, Maggie Haberman knows Donald Trump
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   and could get quotes from him off the record whenever she wanted.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And therefore her TikTok reporting on the Trump presidency was the best
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   and helped them win awards for their coverage.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   They're like, let's just get really good reporters.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   So I think that's the other thing going on here.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Is that in 2014, the Times is like, get on Twitter.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It'll help get us readers.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And by 2022, they're saying, wait a second.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I think you're too big on Twitter. We should maybe come back.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   So that's the fourth mystery reason as well.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   All right. So that's what's going on. That's my read of this case.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   There's obvious issues with Twitter for reporters
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   and there's this more sort of complicated, cynical issue going on with reporters.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I don't know. Again, in the end, I don't think my conclusion here
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   is going to be surprising to our listeners.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Deep work is difficult.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   It rewards long, undistracted focus on things that are cognitively demanding
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   that you can apply a skilled effort to.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Writing at the highest level, writing at the level of the New York Times
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   is cognitively demanding that requires deep work.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And in most circumstances, it's probably going to be better for the paper
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and psychologically way more healthy.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And from a time management perspective, way more sustainable
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   for reporters to be freed from the burden of having to be
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   in that bloody, messy, distracting, psychologically devastating arena
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   that is Twitter.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So regardless of which of those reasons you agree with or disagree with,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I think most people will see there's enough good reasons there
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   to justify this shift away from everyone associated with media
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   in any sort of way having to be so actively engaged
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   on all of these platforms.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   So that's my take.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And I'll just use that as an excuse to once again say, "I told you so."
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   All right. Well, Jesse, we've got some good questions,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   but I think we should talk about a couple sponsors first.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I'll tell you the sponsor we should be thanking today is NyQuil.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Yes, that's where I am.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Sudafed. I am hopped up on Sudafed right now.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   We'll see how that goes.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Sudafed and Advil. I have aches. I have chills.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I'm telling you, man, this is--and I think this is a literal fair comparison,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   the equivalent of Michael Jordan's flu game in--what was it, '96?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Same thing.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Same thing, right?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Both in terms of the difficulty of what I'm doing
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and how bad I feel and how impressed the world will be by my performance here.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   You're going to come out and score 40?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   There's going to be a 30 for 30 about this podcast episode we're recording right now.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   It's going to be called "Minor Podcaster I Think Has a Cold?"
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   That's what they're going to call it.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   It'll come right after the article when you got attacked by the zebra in Africa.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Oh, man, but sponsors.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Okay, well, here's a sponsor that I recommend to avoid getting sick too often
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   because if you're in good shape, you get sick less often,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and no one's going to get you in better shape than My Body Tutor.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   My Body Tutor is founded by my longtime friend Adam Gilbert,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   who used to be the fitness advice guru on my original Study Hacks blog.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   I remember when he started this company.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I thought it was very smart at the time.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   After the pandemic made everyone get really used to remote video
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   and remote connection with people, it became a brilliant idea.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Here's how it works.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   It's a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   the lack of consistency.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   They do this by simplifying the process of getting healthier and getting stronger
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   into practical, sustainable behaviors,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   and then they give you daily accountability.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   You use an app on your phone to check in with your personal online coach every single day.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Here's what I ate. Here's what I did. Here's how much I slept.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Here's what I'm worried about. Here's what I need some advice on.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   That accountability is why My Body Tutor gets people in shape in a way that just buying a book
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   or buying a Peloton or buying some weights and just staring at them
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and trying to convince yourself maybe I should use them doesn't do.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   If you are serious about getting fit, Adam will give you as a Deep Questions listener $50 off your first month.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   All you have to do is mention this podcast when you sign up.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   If you have any questions, Adam wants you to call or text.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   You can actually find his personal cell phone number at the top of every page of mybodytutor.com.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   That should tell you A, how committed he is to his clients,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   and B, that this is not some massive venture-backed 7,000 coaches doing automated coaching type of organization here.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   This is a personal organization. They will work with you. They'll get you healthier.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   mybodytutor.com
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   We also want to talk about ExpressVPN.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Now you know that I am a believer in VPNs. That stands for Virtual Private Network.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   With a VPN, instead of directly connecting to the website or service you want to connect to,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   you instead connect first to a VPN server with a secure encrypted connection.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   You tell the server who you want to talk to. The server talks to that site.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   The server talks to that service on your behalf.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   So that site or service has no idea where you're coming from or who necessarily you are.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Your connection to the VPN is encrypted, so people sniffing your packets nearby have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Look, computer scientists like me, we use VPNs all the time.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   ExpressVPN is the one I use when I am in particular traveling or when I want to connect to places
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   where I don't want them to know I'm connecting to them because it has the most server options,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   the most bandwidth, it's fast, it just works in the background, you don't even know that it's on.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   You should be using a VPN too, and ExpressVPN is what I would recommend.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   So Blazing Fast Speeds, it'll work with all of your devices, phone, laptops, media council, smart TVs, and more.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   They now have servers in 94 different countries.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So for example, if you don't live in the UK and you want to watch something on BBC,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   connect to a VPN server in the UK and then go to BBC, it thinks you're in the UK, you can see that free content.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   You could do that in a lot of different countries with a lot of different tools.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   And so I recommend it. So be smart. Stop paying full price for streaming services
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   and only getting a fraction of their content. Stop letting your traffic be sniffed by anyone nearby.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Stop letting all these websites you're talking to track every last thing about you
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and sell that to advertisers and use it to profile you.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Instead, get a VPN like I use at expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Don't forget to use my link at expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   If you do that /deep, you will get a three extra months of ExpressVPN for free.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   All right. Sponsors.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I heard, Jesse, that we have sold out every ad slot for 2022.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   So I think people are interested in the Deep Questions audience.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So I guess thank you, audience, for being so sellable to.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I don't know if that's a compliment or not. Whatever you are, you're very attractive to advertisers.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   So, you know, cheers.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Keeps the podcast rolling.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Keeps it rolling. Yeah. I mean, come on, you're $500,000 a week.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   That paycheck's expensive.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   These type of digs that we record in, that doesn't come cheap.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Coffee bill.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   The coffee bill, that alone is $50,000 a month.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   The dumb waiter for the drinks for happy hours.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   We don't have that yet, but that's coming.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I'll say I was looking at some of our YouTube videos recently.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   The HQ shows up, shows big on YouTube.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   I don't know if you notice this when you're editing them,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   but like when you watch it and you see this black curtain back there,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   to me it looks like I'm in like a really big, like on a stage.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Like we're in this like huge space with these curtains in the distance.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I don't think people realize that I could reach forward, if I lean forward a little bit,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I could touch Jesse's face.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And this curtain seems like, I don't know why I'm giving away these secrets,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   this curtain seems like it's, you know, 10 feet away in a giant platform,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   but I'm touching it right now.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   So it's funny.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   We can see the bathroom while we're recording.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But you know what? I like the suspension of disbelief that we are in like a massive studio.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   As we talked about, the table is really nice.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   It's a nice table. Yeah, it's small, but it's nice.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   It doesn't show on camera, but there's like a really nice metal work legs.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   I don't know what you'd call it, but whatever.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   All right. Well, I know people like to hear our thoughts on interior decorating,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   but I suppose we should do a couple of questions.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Our first one comes from Andrew.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Andrew asks, "Is the hive mind ever beneficial?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I am convinced by your core tenet that the hyperactive hive mind is almost always
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   counterproductive to the ends it seeks to achieve.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   As a personal example, I used to work for a large consulting firm where incessant emails,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Teams messaging, and unproductive meetings were the norm.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   I now work for a 15-person startup with minimal communication
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   and a lot of trust between team members.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   My ability to produce quality and develop my skills has grown significantly.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   However, as a thought experiment, I am curious whether you think that there are ever
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   certain emergent outcomes of the hive mind spontaneity that ultimately creates better
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   collective outcomes. Beehives, after all, are very impressive compared to individual bees."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Well, first of all, Andrew, speaking of sponsors,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   whatever this company is you work for now, this 15-person startup,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   that should be a sponsor of the show because the way you describe that startup,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   I think you'd get a lot of really good applicants if you were to actually advertise.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I love that. Minimal communication, lots of trust, your ability to produce work
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   and develop skills has grown significantly. Everyone keep that in mind.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   There are companies, there are teams that do not just worship at the altar of the
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   hyperactive hive mind. They get things done. People are happier.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   They produce better work.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   The utopia I lay out in my book, A World Without Email, is possible.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   All right, so let's get to his question.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Quick reminder, the hyperactive hive mind, this is a term from my book,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   A World Without Email.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   It is an idea where the notion is this is my name for the default collaboration
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   and coordination strategy that most office work environments deploy.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   That's where you figure most things out with back and forth unscheduled ad hoc messaging
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   delivered via email, delivered via team, delivered via Slack.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I don't care about the medium.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   The defining attribute of the hyperactive hive mind is that it's just all unscheduled
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   and on the fly. Hey, what about this? Did you get this? I don't know.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Do you want to meet next week? When are you free?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Hey, when should we, what should we tell this client when he comes?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Just messages back and forth, asynchronous, unscheduled, back and forth.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And the whole opening part of my book argues that for most places, that's a disaster.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   It's a disaster primarily because if unscheduled back and forth messaging is how you do most of your coordination,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   that workflow requires individuals to constantly monitor these channels of communication,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   not because they have bad habits, not because they've never heard about batching,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   but because it's required.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   You would slow everything down if you wait hours before you respond to everything,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   because you might have 10 different ongoing coordination decisions that need 15 messages each to be decided.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   They all have to be decided by tomorrow. You can't wait four hours before you send the next one back.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   So the hyperactive hive mind requires constant checking of channels.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Constant checking puts you in a constant state of context, shifting terrible,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   terrible setup to actually get cognitive work done at any sort of reasonable level.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   OK, but Andrew is saying, is there any instances in a work environment where the sort of like back and forth
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   on the fly messaging might actually lead to a really smart outcome?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And I would say, Andrew, the only instance I can think of is small groups.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   So if there's a small number of people, let's say three or less, working on whatever,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   getting a startup off the ground, and maybe they're in the same office or you're spread over the country
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and you're on a Slack channel.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   That's actually a perfectly reasonable environment to say, let's just rock and roll.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   There's so much we have to figure out. We can't even list the stuff that needs to be done.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   We're just in crisis mode. Hey, what about this? Can you do this? Decision after decision,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   bouncing things back and forth. You're a small group of people. It's not a bad way to coordinate.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   In fact, historically, and I'm talking pre-computer network technology,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   the hyperactive hive mind is the workflow deployed by small groups of people.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   The example I give in my book is that if you have a collection of three paleolithic mastodon hunters
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   trying to position themselves to kill a mastodon, what's their collaboration strategy?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Hyperactive hive mind. Hey, what about there? Go over here. Do you hear this? Stop for a second.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Okay, now I want you to move over there. On-demand, ad hoc, back and forth, unscheduled.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   So hyperactive hive mind has a naturalistic foundation, very efficient, flexible way
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   for small groups of people to coordinate. Once the groups get bigger,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   once they get beyond the small group of people, it doesn't scale.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Then there's just too many conversations going on. Now you have to constantly be servicing it.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   The actual work these conversations are about now can't actually get done at any sort of reasonable level
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   because you're constantly context shifting. So once you get past the small group, no, Andrew,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   the hyperactive hive mind is almost never going to be what you need to do.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   So if you look at bees, for example, yes, the collective behavior of bees is way more sophisticated
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   than the behavior of individual bees. I'm more familiar with ant hives.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   The collective behavior of ants is way more sophisticated than what an individual ant is actually encoded to do.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I've actually done research on this. I've published some papers.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   They're probably pretty impenetrable, I would say, to the lay audience.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I'm trying to think what the name of the last paper I wrote on this. I wrote a paper on this years ago.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Now this will put people to sleep. The basic idea was we were looking at a cooperative ant searching problem
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and we're proving mathematically the minimum bits of memory needed in an automaton representing an ant
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   required for this collaborative search to be anywhere near optimal.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   And the hint is that it's something like the double log of the number of ants involved.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   You need something like the double log. So the logarithm of the logarithm.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Choose your base. I don't care. We're being asymptotic. The logarithm of the logarithm of the number of ants.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   You need at least that much memory if you're going to have any hope of whatever your coordination algorithm is
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   to fully take advantage of the collaborative search abilities.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   So maybe I should get a whiteboard and I'll go through some of the math.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   No, but anyway, the point is I know about this stuff.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Those behaviors were evolved over millions of years because it's incredibly complicated to figure out the right
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   individual behavior, the algorithm, so to speak, that these individual units run in an ant hive or a beehive
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   that's going to cause this really smart global behavior for the whole hive itself or the whole ant colony itself
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   is really, really subtle and really, really difficult.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   It took millions of years of evolution to figure out.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   That should be instructive when we're thinking about groups of people who are trying to work together in a business context.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   It is really hard to figure out what is the right stuff for each individual to do, the right behavior,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   the right rules by which you react to things, the rules by which or mechanisms by which communication happens,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   whatever our digital equivalent is of the pheromone trails that ants evolved to use or the waggle dances that bees evolved to use.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   If you don't know what a waggle dance is, look it up. It's crazy. It's really interesting.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   That's really difficult to figure out.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   So if you want to figure out the local behavior that's going to lead to an optimal emergent collective action,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   don't expect that to just be whatever you guys come up with, you know, in the three years after this new tool was introduced.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Don't just expect it like, hey, guys, just rock and roll. Here's some email. Here's teams. Enjoy. You're welcome.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And if you're not, you're not going to be able to do it.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   So I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   It's the equivalent of just putting a random algorithm into the brains of a bunch of ants.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Let me tell you, as someone who studied this, what will happen if you put just an arbitrary algorithm into the brains of a bunch of ants.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Those ants are going to disperse and be killed immediately.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And yet, when it comes to work, we just assume, ah, it should be fine.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   We'll let people figure out on their own, like, what's the right way to collaborate.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   We'll just email. It'll work out. And it doesn't.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   So anyways, this is my argument, Andrew, is that the lesson from nature is that it's very difficult to build an effective distributed system.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   The individual algorithms, the rules, the tools by which you can build big systems that work well are non-obvious.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   They're non-trivial. They require either a ton of evolution or a lot of thinking and testing.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   So we should be way more serious about how we run our organizations.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   But to me, it's by far the most surprising thing about the state of business today is the lack of time we actually spend thinking about those things.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   There we go. Jesse, I'm sure you've read that paper of mine.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Jesse brings it up all the time.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   There's a few simplifying assumptions in our constant state Markov model that he believes are elementary and maybe short-sighted.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Am I quoting you correctly?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Pretty much, yeah. As long as you get the whiteboard in here, we've got plenty of space for it.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Yeah, we've got to get that whiteboard in here.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   So now we have a triple threat podcast idea based on our previous discussions.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Sports news on sports I know nothing about. Fantasy, like fandom news that just angers fans because we know nothing about the fandoms.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And then we connect it with just a lot of mathematics. Triple threat.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   We would just call it the worst podcast.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Truth in advertising.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Oh man. All right. Is that just one question?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Yeah, I'm sick. I got to pick up the pace. All right. We're going to pick up the pace here.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Abhishek has the next question.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Abhishek asks, how do I address a heavy workload if I do not have much agency over the work assigned to me?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I'm in logistics and it's been a very busy period for the last few years.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Some days I find myself having to switch between three to five projects, a few of which have deliverables this week.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   I'm very good at scheduling my time, time block planning, multi-scale planning, etc.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And my manager is a good manager. And they listen to me when I say I have too much on my plate.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But sometimes projects just keep coming back for additional rounds of bidding.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And there are weeks when I have to work on three or four projects every day.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   What are some ways I can manage a busy week that requires frequent context shifting?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   All right, Abhishek, there's a few things I want to say here.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   I mean, the standard you have to maintain of all the different types of advice I give,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   the standard that you want to maintain is I work on one thing at a time until a stopping point.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And I do not context shift during that work.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   No email, no slack. If I'm going to work on this, I'm going to work on this till a stopping point.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   I'm not saying if you have a 10 hour review, you're going to do 10 hours in a row without a stopping point.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   But you'll break that up. But when you're working on these chunks, you work on it without a context shift.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   All right. This means during busy weeks, there's not going to be a ton of time that you're actually able to,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   let's say, engage with the hyperactive hive mind back and forth with the emails and the questions.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And people might even in the moment get a little bit annoyed.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Right now, for example, I'm just coming off this really hard period at Georgetown.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It's hard because I was I was co-chairing a faculty recruiting committee.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I was sitting on another faculty recruiting committee. So we were just bringing out lots of candidates to interview.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   So it was hard in the sense that I just lost a lot of my time because meals, lunches, interviews, going to talks, et cetera.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   But I was committed. I work on one thing, work on one thing at a time.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And when I was outside of all those commitments, I typically most of my time was being filled on the other stuff that has to be done.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Prepping for courses, research, et cetera, some writing. And so I didn't get to see my inbox a lot.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And, yeah, that would annoy people in the moment, but they get over it.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   I mean, I just saw an email in my inbox just before we went on the air.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Like a few days ago, some writer friends of mine had sent out something like we should restart a writers group, which were whatever.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Like it's good. And like, here's a doodle poll. Can people fill it out?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I hadn't seen that because it's been three days since I've been able to look at that particular inbox.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   And I had a follow up email that's like, you got to answer us because we want to move on.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And, you know, so I'm annoying people. But, you know, sometimes that's just when you're in a busy week, you're going to annoy people.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   But you can give things full attention till you move on to the next thing.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   It's going to make that much more tractable. It's going to reduce the amount of time that it requires.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   So I think that's important.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Two, to the extent possible, when a non-trivial bit of work falls on your plate.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Oh man, this project just came back for rebidding.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Figure out before you get going the entire process for how you are going to execute that,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   including how and when you're going to coordinate with other people involved.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Reduce work in the processes.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   I'm going to work on this on this day, Wednesday afternoon.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   I'm having an open Zoom where I'm going to discuss three different projects that are going on now.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   So you have to come and talk to me then. And that's where we're going to do the revisions.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   And then I'm going to send it to you for feedback on Thursday morning.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Spend that time up front so you have clarity.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Here's how we're going to execute going forward.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   And you're not wasting time thinking about what I should do next.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Or having to do context switching and email to try to make progress on things.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   You want to, as much as possible during busy periods, reduce your dependence on the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   The perfect state during a busy period would be one where you never have to look at an email inbox.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   It's all figured out how the work is going to happen and you're just executing.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   You're getting rid of that overhead.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   The final thing I want to say here, Abhishek, is general.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   You say your employers listen to you when you say you have too much on your plate already.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   But you are way miscalibrated.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   This is a very common issue when you're trying to figure out what's a reasonable workload.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   When you say yes to things.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   You're looking at probably best case scenarios.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   You are calibrating your load.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   A lot of people do this. They calibrate their load to the best possible case scenario.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Well, you know, yeah, if I'm just working on one of these projects at a time, it shouldn't take too long.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And there's like long delays before they come back.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   And most won't come back.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And so like this should be fine.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Yes, I'll do this too. I'll do that too.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   You need to calibrate your workload instead to like expected case or worst case scenarios.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   In a week where all of these things I say yes to have come back and I have to work at them all.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Given the other types of stuff I have to do for the company.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Will that be a sustainable week or crazy?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And if it's crazy, then I have to say no.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   So a properly calibrated work volume.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   That's my terminology for the total number of things on your plate that represent an obligation you have to satisfy.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   The proper calibration means there will be times where you feel under scheduled.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And then occasional times you feel like you really are using every minute of your day.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And again, I think we calibrate too often for the best case or an average case.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And so when we get those not infrequent harder cases.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   It becomes completely unsustainable.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   So if they'll listen to you, then tell them I need to I need to drop this load by another 50 percent.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   The total number. And I would track large and medium projects on your plate.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I would track it. And here's how many here's how many of these I should have.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   I'm at my quota. I can't take this on.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   If you're doing this sort of process centric planning, put the work time for projects on your calendar.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   So you can see real easily like there's no time left for me to fit something else in.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   So I think you probably need to cut back more on the work on your plate.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   All right. Picking up the pace, moving right along.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   We have Jeffrey. Just my papers here. All right, Jeffrey, what do you have for me?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Jeffrey says, what do you do when your passion might start to become economically viable?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Currently, I have an OK thing going as CFO for a small company, but for a long time I had a hobby.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Writing fiction, I got some short stories published in professional publications.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   I even received a few prizes and caught the interest of an agent.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   At this stage, I realized that the next step was to write a full novel, but this would take significant time.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   As a consequence, I'd perform some basic economic analysis, determine how best to spend my time.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   I'll spare you the details of all of Jeffrey's analysis.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   But basically, he worked out that if he wrote one hour per day, it would take him three years to write the novel.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And then he had a lot of issues about that. Would he lose interest if he had to drag it out that long?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Though he has time to do that, would that be time he could have spent on other activities that would help him advance his career as a CFO?
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   So he's trying to figure this all out. All right. So, Jeffrey, my thoughts.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   A, it's clear from your tone that you're interested in novel writing and not super psyched about your job.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   You say, it's fine. I like my boss. It's manageable, but not super exciting.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   In your elaboration, you say that multiple times. So that's interesting to me.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   So what you want to do, it sounds like, is seriously explore the possibility of making more of your income come from writing, spend more time writing.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Now, I think we have to do a Derek Sivers thing here, right? We need to use money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   We can't just guess, especially when it comes to fiction writing.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   You can't just guess how much am I going to make as a writer and plan based off of that.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   You need to make money as a writer and say, here's how much I make as a writer.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   And then you can make really informed tactical decisions about what to do with your job.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   So how do you get that information faster?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Well, I'm going to say, first of all, you've got to write more than an hour a day.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   I think you should find out how to get the 20 hours a week. I think you can do that.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   I think you need two hour writing blocks, which means you probably have to start earlier in the morning and a large weekend block as well.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   I think do at least that. You can get the 20 hours a week.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Now we're greatly accelerating the pace.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And even if you're only doing 15 hours a week, you're greatly accelerating the pace. And then two, take time off.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Take two weeks off. Don't even have to be vacation.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Look, you're going to assume that you're going to sell the novel and agent is interested.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Roll the dice and take a two week leave of absence. You can get easy 50 hours in two weeks.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   So you can get like a big push to finalize and polish it.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   So that's what I'm saying, like 20 hours a week, 15, 20 hours a week, four months from now, take a two week leave of absence.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Knock that thing out. So let's get the feedback soon.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Get that novel out there, see if you sell it, how much money, what does my agents think, what does my editors think?
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   What are the reasonable case scenarios for my career here as a writer?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Then you have the data to make the right decision and the right decision may be full time writing.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Maybe, I mean, if your spouse also works and you can live kind of cheap, that might work.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Maybe, and Jeffrey, I'm looking between the lines here.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   If Jeffrey is a pseudonym for Brandon Sanderson, I would say you probably are OK.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   You're probably OK. You can probably quit your job.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Or maybe what it is is you change your job. You know, you're a CFO of a small company.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   That means you could be a financial consultant for companies.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   We see this all the time. Part time CFOs that smaller firms and smaller nonprofits hire to spend 10 hours a week.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   They keep their books and help them make decisions, but they can't afford a full executive.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Go to that work and like, great, and I'll be able to do that 30 hours a week and I'm writing the rest.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Then when my books get more successful, I can drop that the 10 hours.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   There's a lot that will be open to you, but you need the hard data and you have to publish the book or at least sell the book.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Sell the book to get data to make that decision. And I'm just going to say don't take three years.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   Work harder. Take time off. Take some but manageable risk.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Risk not like quitting your job, but like leave of absences or putting aside all promotion activities for a few months.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Get the book done. See what happens.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   As Brandon Sanderson learned when he wrote Name of the Wind, you sometimes you got to just write.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   All right, Jesse, it's not an episode if we don't annoy.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Not only does that annoy fantasy fans, but annoys everyone who's not because they have no idea what the hell we're talking about.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   So that's another double whammy. That's the type of stuff you're going to get with our triple threat show.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Once things die down, he's probably going to be your first guest.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Brandon?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   He'll be in here. He'll like Tacoma coffee.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Where's he? Where's he based? He's like Utah or something.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   He's probably got enough money to fly here, though.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Yeah, he's got to fly out here.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   I do want to have I mean, we do want to do guests.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   We're trying to think through like what the right format is.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Do we want people who are living interesting lives? What famous people do?
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Whatever. We're trying to figure that out.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Selfishly, I want you to talk to a bunch of people. I want you to talk to Elon. I want you to talk to Mark.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Jesse has the most unreasonable plans for our.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   I think they all want to talk to you.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Jesse has ridiculously unreasonable plans for who's going to come in here.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   I can pick him up from the, you know, the train with my truck.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   That'd be awesome. If you picked up Elon in your truck, Zack would bring you a truck.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   You know how many publicists would get fired if those people came here and like they came with their publicist?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   They're like, oh, my God, I'm terrible at my job.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   No, I like your optimism. I like it.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   But anyways, we're going to have guests. And I for sure at the top of my list is I want to have novelists on.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   I think it'd be cool to talk to. I'm going to talk to working, not literary novelists, because that seems unapproachable and hard, but genre novelists.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And like, tell me about your life.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Yeah. Speaking of publicists, real quick, it's in some of those shows like the super pumped one and we crash one.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   They have publicists in there and they get treated horribly.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   The publicist?
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Despite those like really rich CEO dudes who are like a tenacious.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Oh, man.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And by the wives.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Well, hopefully Lillian and Margo, you don't feel like I treat you that way.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I try to be I try to be nice.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   We got a great team of publicist at Portfolio who have been dragged around various cities with me to going to various various places and studios.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   And I always appreciate what they do.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   So Lillian and Margo, you have my appreciation.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   I will try not to be like the WeWork guy.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Speaking of work, this is going to be another professional transition.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Speaking about work, I want to talk briefly about workable.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   The company you should be using to hire.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Hiring is critical and it's never been harder.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   One stat that I just have off the top of my head because I think about these things is that there are 40 percent, 46 percent more jobs being posted than before the pandemic.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   And there are 44 percent fewer candidates applying to each one.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   So you need help hiring.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Use workable to get that help.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   When you sign up for workable, they will first help you cast the widest net possible by posting your jobs to all the top job boards, more than 200 total.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Then they have tools to help you go through the process of hiring.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Once you find candidates, video interview tools, e-signature tools.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   They'll even help you automate repetitive tasks like doing the scheduling itself so you can focus on just talking to the candidate and hiring the right person.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   So whether you're hiring for your coffee shop or your engineering team, or if you need a new publicist for your publicity firm because your last one took your client to Cal Newport's Deep Work HQ and it was embarrassing.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Workable is exactly what you need to hire the right people fast.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Start hiring today with a risk-free 15-day trial.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   If you hire during the trial, which a lot of people do, it won't cost you a thing.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   So just go to workable.com/podcast and start hiring.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Workable is hiring made easy.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   Just you know I'm sick and tired because I keep bumping into the microphone.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   This is real professional grade broadcasting.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   You don't see Joe Buck on, you know, the Super Bowl broadcast knocking into his microphone.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   So you know, you know where everyone's in.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   He just got a new contract actually.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Crazy contract.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   There's a lot of money in being good at talking about sports.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   By the way, it's really hard.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   I've learned it's really hard to talk clearly and confidently on the spot about anything difficult.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   And people are like, I know sports.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Like, yeah, but you can't talk for two hours about here's what just happened in that play.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   And it's really difficult.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   They never stumble.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   And they have to know everybody's name and how to pronounce it.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   Yeah, that's a hard, that's a hard job.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Hard job.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Another hard job is writing clearly.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Look, here we are in 2022.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And you're out there trying to get things going again.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Maybe you're trying to get a new job or grow your company.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   Nothing is going to be more important than being able to express yourself clearly.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   And that requires good professional writing.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   This is why you need Grammarly to help you produce that writing.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Grammarly is more than a spelling and grammar checker.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   It's an all-in-one writing tool that allows you to clearly and effectively communicate your ideas.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   There's a free version and a premium version.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Both have features that can save time and give you the confidence of knowing your writing sounds professional.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   It works on all the devices you use.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   It works on all the apps that you write.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   You should use it.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   I have been messing around with Grammarly Premium.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   I am floored by the type of stuff these tools can do today.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   I remember when grammar checkers would tell you that you used the possessive form of "there" instead of the other form.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   And that was about it.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   No longer.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Today, it's like having a digital editor sitting there looking over your shoulder.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   Grammarly will actually adjust your clarity.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   It will tell you your tone.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   It will say, "Okay, we've studied what you're writing.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   This is the formality level.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Maybe that's too formal."
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   I was really impressed with what I see, especially from the advanced features in Grammarly Premium.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   So it will help you be clear and assertive in your emails.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   It will help you persuade your audience with a confident and polished tone.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   That's where the tone adjuster can work.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Let's say you have a hard-to-read sentence.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Its full-sentence rewrite tool that you can get in Grammarly Premium will help you make that sentence much better.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Let's say you're using too much jargon.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Its clarity suggestions will come in and say, "Just say it this way.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   This is much clearer."
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   That's the type of stuff I get from my editors.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   You can get this now with the Grammarly Premium plugin.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   So get through those emails and your work quicker by keeping it concise, confident, and effective with Grammarly.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Go to grammarly.com/deep to sign up for a free account.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   When you're ready to upgrade to Grammarly Premium, you will get 25 or 20% off for being my listener.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   But you have to go to that grammarly.com/deep when you originally sign up to get that 20% off.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   So that's 20% off at g-r-a-m-m-a-r-l-y.com/deep.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   All right.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Let's say we're going to do lightning round here.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   I have two questions.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   I'm out of time and energy, so let's do them fast.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   All right.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Question number one comes from Andrew.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   "Do you have suggestions for dealing with the tradeoff between teaching and scholarship obligations?
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   For me, as a professor at a liberal arts college, this balance is particularly hard because we're definitely expected to publish,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   but we teach a lot and we're expected to devote quite a bit of time outside of class aspects of teaching as well.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   I've started to come to the conclusion that I might have to simply accept a lower standard of quality when it comes to teaching,
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   doing what Oliver Berkman in his book, 4,000 Weeks, calls choosing what to fail at.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   In other words, create assignments so they can grade more quickly,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   even if they don't do the job quite like I'd like them to, or assign fewer of them,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   stop failing with my lectures every single semester, et cetera."
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   All right.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   Well, Andrew, you're right, though.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Don't use Berkman's terminology here.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Don't use Berkman's terminology here.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   You were right in the sense that you need to spend less time on your teaching prep,
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   but you're not choosing to fail at your teaching prep.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   What I actually want to argue is that you can spend less time on your teaching without degrading the quality of your teaching.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   If anything, you might even increase the quality of your teaching.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   There's a sort of famous study that came out of Sunni Stony Brook, and I apologize, I forgot the author's name,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   but he was studying professors in the classroom and actually found that a reduction in time spent in class prep
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   could increase the positive evaluations of the course.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   So this is why I say you're right and you're wrong.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   You're wrong in saying that spending less time means you're failing at teaching.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   I don't think that's the case, but you're right in the sense that you need to spend less time.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Come up with assignments that, yes, test the material well,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   but are also optimized so that they are not going to take up all of your time to grade.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Once you've written a lecture really well, don't rewrite it from scratch every time you teach that course.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Lean into the fact that you can reuse that effort.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Do a 10% or 20% tweak rule.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   I do this a lot with problem sets.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Why am I going to rewrite a problem set from scratch every single time I teach a class?
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   I've worked a long time on those problems.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   What I'm going to do is make it 10% better.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   So if I keep teaching this class, over time, those problem sets get much better and better,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   and the problem set I'm giving to my class five years from now is going to be much better than anything I could write from scratch.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   Like these type of things where you're trying to reduce time do not mean you're giving up on the class itself.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   I've seen teachers completely drown at the college level in over-preparing for every lecture,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   where often the lectures that come across well is someone who knows their stuff well,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   they publish in the field, they're clear and they're confident, and they deliver the information.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   No clickers involved.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   No complicated breakout groups needed.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   I know my stuff. I'm going to explain it clearly.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   I'm going to make my expectations clear. Let's rock and roll.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   Actually, like a lot of students, like, great, I know what's going on here.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   I understand it. I'm evaluated fairly. That's good.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   The other thing that kills professors from a time perspective in the classroom is this idea that
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   if I'm not always accessible in every possible form, the students will be mad.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   A complete myth. The students don't need you to be available all the time.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   They need extreme clarity about when you are available.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   If they have clarity about how I get in touch with Dr. Andrew and it's reasonable, they're fine.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   They just don't want to waste time worrying like maybe I can't get in touch with them,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   maybe I'm not going to get in touch with them.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   So, Andrew, I think you can significantly reduce the amount of time your classes are taking in your schedule
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   without reducing the quality, if anything, your students might like it better.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   All right. Final question. Moving fast. Comes from Patrick.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   How do you approach complexity? I always wonder how effective thinkers approach complexity.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Of course, it all starts with getting a cursory overview and then circling in on certain points, weighing options, etc.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   But how do you approach all of this when already the first step requires you to make decisions?
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   That's when I start to lose my mental framework and get lost in different scenarios.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   Endless research and tend to get overwhelmed by dependencies between different factors.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   And I'm not talking about doing fancy research project. For me, this is trying to buy a vacuum cleaner.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   Patrick, you exhaust me just hearing you talk about this.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   It sounds like you're someone who spends probably too much time on those rationalist bulletin boards
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   where everyone's trying so hard. Like if I can just figure out how to be super, super rational about everything,
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   I'll optimize everything I do and no one can be no one will ever be able to like say something mean to me
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   because I'll always know the right thing and always act in the right way.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   You got to loosen up, Patrick. You got to loosen up when it comes to personal life decisions.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   Just make a reasonable choice. Choose a couple of things you like about it. Be happy about it. Move on.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   You have a fine vacuum cleaner. I like that the cord is long. Great. Move on with life.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Don't obsess about it being the right vacuum cleaner or that you're the best vacuum cleaner guy.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Or you know more about vacuum cleaners than anyone else because that's going to exhaust you.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   And also it makes people think you're annoying.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Now, when it comes to mastering complex ideas and research and work and writing, that's a whole other different topic.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   But even over there, I'll just tell you this very briefly, Patrick.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   There's a lot more intuition involved in that than you might expect.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Like if I'm working on a complex topic, like I'm writing a really long article or a book chapter or something,
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   I'll marinate in it. I'll read. I'll talk to people.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   And then when it comes time to write about it, I try to apply a simplifying framework to it.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   And I just listen to my gut. And if it doesn't feel right, if there's like a nagging little friction,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   a little bit of grit in the gears, I'm like, I got to change something here.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Either got to simplify it or change the framework. And when it feels right, I'm like, this is good.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Not that I'm getting things exactly right. Not that this is like every detail that matters.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   But this is a deeper, almost mythological truth about this situation.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   It's getting to the core of it because it feels right. It doesn't feel like there's grit in the gears.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   It doesn't feel like this doesn't quite fit with that. There's a lot of gut to it.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   And you practice by reading lots of arguments at similar levels of complexity in books,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   listening to a podcast of smart people. So you train your taste.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   I understand when complex ideas are presented well, but honestly, there's a lot of gut involved in it.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   So Patrick, chill out a little bit. Your vacuum cleaner is fine.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   You're not going to optimize everything. Do the best you can. Focus on what's interesting. Trust your gut.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   All right, Jesse. Well, that's all I have before I collapse here.
