[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, if my faith was stronger, would I be healthier?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.460]   If my faith was deeper, would I be more financially secure?
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.840]   And would I be happier and more comfortable?
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.520]   In other words, does Jesus say that our sorrow is traced back to a lack of faith on our part?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.960]   Today's question is from a podcast listener named Scott.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.200]   A question always arises for me when I read about Jesus' exorcism of the epileptic boy
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:36.320]   possessed by a demon in Matthew 17 verses 14 to 20, Mark 9, 17 to 29, and Luke 9, 37
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.800]   to 43.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.760]   What does Jesus mean by 'because of your little faith'?
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.180]   What is it exactly that the disciples lacked?
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.100]   It seems like Jesus' answer gives easy fuel to suffering Christians who might be told
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.140]   that Jesus suggested if they just had enough faith, they could be healed.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.480]   How is that not the takeaway?"
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.680]   Well, I'm going to try to deal with these words of Jesus, even though I do not fully
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.400]   understand them and find them in part baffling.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.000]   And I choose to go ahead and try to answer this just so that our listeners will know
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.960]   that there are passages in the Bible that are baffling, at least there are to me.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.720]   They leave me with questions, and I thought it might be helpful to just struggle out loud
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.960]   and invite others to join me and maybe go further than I can.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.260]   And I should say here at the beginning that bumping into things like this doesn't undermine
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:56.740]   my faith, because Jesus has done so much and said so much that the glory of God in him
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:05.620]   has won me over to trust him and treasure him because of what I do see and I do understand,
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.740]   even if there are aspects of what he says that sometimes I don't understand.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.100]   So that's how it works with my faith, in case anybody wonders, "Well, how do you even sleep
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.260]   at night if you can't understand Jesus?"
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.300]   Well, it's just one little part that baffles me.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.540]   So here we go.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.500]   Let's focus on Matthew 17.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.740]   I can't deal with all these texts.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.940]   Let's just take one, Matthew 17, verses 17 to 20.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.920]   Jesus comes down off the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.180]   He finds that the disciples were unable to heal a boy and cast out a demon that the Father
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.120]   had brought to the disciples, and Jesus' response to their inability in the Father's statement
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   they couldn't do it, he says, verse 17, "Oh, faithless and twisted generation, how long
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   am I to be with you?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.300]   How long am I to bear with you?
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   Bring him here to me."
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.880]   And I think that that's a reference not just to the crowds, but to the disciples, because
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.120]   they're the ones who couldn't do it.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   They're the ones who didn't have the faith.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.640]   So he's saying some pretty strong things.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.560]   "Oh, faithless and twisted generation," keeps going.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.360]   Verse 18, "Jesus rebuked the demon.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.040]   It came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.600]   And then the disciples came to Jesus and said privately, 'Why couldn't we cast it out?'
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.840]   And he said to them, 'Because of your little face.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.160]   For truly I say to you, if you have face like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.100]   mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.100]   for you.'"
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.880]   Now, here's what's baffling to me about these words.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:58.760]   First, in verse 17, Jesus says to the disciples that they are faithless, apistea, they're
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   faithless.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.120]   That is, have no faith, at least no faith for this healing.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.960]   And then in verse 20, when the disciples say, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.880]   He says, "You have little faith.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.360]   That's because of your little faith."
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.120]   I was like, scratching my head.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.880]   Okay, no faith, little faith?
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.760]   Why does he say both?
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.360]   And then, to make matters even more perplexing, he says, "If you had faith as a grain of mustard
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.560]   seed, you could move mountains."
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.240]   Well, now, back in chapter 13, verse 32, he had said that the mustard seed is the smallest
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240]   of all seeds.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.120]   So clearly, the point here is, if you just had a mustard seed faith, you could move mountains.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.240]   Well, if that's true, why is it that their small faith was the reason they couldn't
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.240]   cast out the demon?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.440]   I mean, how small faith is what a mustard seed-sized faith is.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.920]   And yet he's accusing them of having small faith, and that's why you can't cast out
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   the demons.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.560]   And then he turns around and says, "If you had a mustard seed faith, you could move a
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.920]   mountain."
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.520]   You see why I'm confused?
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.400]   I'm baffled by what Jesus is saying here.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.760]   So, here's my stab to try to make some sense out of this and how it relates to the question.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:28.360]   First, in saying that we all need a mustard seed of faith to move mountains, it seems
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.880]   to me that Jesus is saying quantity of faith is not the issue.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.720]   Why else would he refer to mustard seed faith if quantity were the issue?
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.080]   So size of faith is not the issue.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.480]   That's the point of mustard seed.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.840]   Number two, second observation.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:59.720]   In describing their little faith as virtually the same as faithlessness, he is saying that
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:07.100]   whatever little faith they're trying to have to heal this boy, it was the wrong kind
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.300]   of faith, not just the wrong size of faith, because size is not the issue anymore.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.040]   It's the wrong kind.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.940]   Faith as a grain of mustard seed seems to be not just an issue of size, but kind, something
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.700]   about this seed.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.420]   Since they had small faith, but it was useless.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.660]   It was as good as faithlessness, so it wasn't like this mustard seed of faith.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:40.980]   Third observation, when we ponder not just how faith differs in quantity but kind, that
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:48.740]   starts to bring up issues like the condition of their hearts when they pray, and the discernment
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.660]   of God's will when they pray.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.020]   There are other parts of Jesus' teaching and the other parts of Scripture that make
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.740]   answered prayer depend on the condition of the heart, like James 4, you ask wrongly to
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.820]   spend it on your passions, that's why you don't get answers to your prayer, and sovereign
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.660]   purposes of God in whether our prayers are answered.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.260]   Like in 1 John 5, you have to pray according to God's will.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.820]   So conclusion, but not a big solution.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:32.240]   I would say to Scott, be sure to take into account all the teachings of the Bible regarding
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:39.180]   answered prayer, both in relation to the condition of the heart of the one who's praying or trying
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:48.540]   to do a work for God, and in relation to the sovereign will of God, rather than assuming
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:55.100]   that in every case of unanswered prayer, for healing's sake, the problem lies with defective
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.380]   faith.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.780]   That was the case here.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:05.340]   But given the way Jesus answers and the other things he says about prayer, I would not assume
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.340]   that's always the case.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.900]   Well I love watching you sweat through hard text.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.700]   Such an encourager to every amateur exegete like me.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.300]   Thank you Pastor John, and thanks for listening and supporting the podcast.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.220]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive, and send
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.860]   us an email of your own, even hard Bible questions, just to watch John Piper squirm a bit.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.740]   You can do all that through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.540]   Well we Protestants don't use confessionals.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.580]   Martin Luther apparently thought the confessional booth was a good idea, although he was very
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.340]   careful to make the practice voluntary, not binding.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.820]   More recently it was John Stott who commended the regular practice of confessing our sins
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.980]   to a trusted pastor.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.140]   There may be a rare Anglican church here or there that has a confessional, but on the
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.820]   whole Protestants don't practice auricular confession of our sins to a minister.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.500]   So what place should private confession of our personal sins to others, fellow Christians,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.580]   play?
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.300]   That is still a very open question, and it's on the table on Wednesday.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.220]   Till then, I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you then.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:12.720]   [END]
