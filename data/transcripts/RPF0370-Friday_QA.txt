[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's Friday.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:22.600]   That means live Q&A.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.320]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.080]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.200]   On Fridays, whenever I'm able to do it, we're a couple of weeks behind here, I do a live
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.440]   Q&A where I show up to a phone line and patrons of the show call in and ask their questions.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.560]   I know the topics that are coming, but I don't know the specifics.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.320]   So together, let's find out what they are and see if I can provide some useful ideas.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.120]   If you'd like to do Q&A, I've always loved this format of radio.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960]   I always enjoy hearing individual people and the problems that they're facing and I figured
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.840]   out a way to do it and bring it to Radical Personal Finance without necessarily setting
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.080]   up a phone screener and all of that.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.680]   We do it in the form of a conference call.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.960]   So every week when I'm in town and I can sit down in front of my computer, we set up the
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.080]   conference line, I open it up, and these calls are open to patrons of the show at a certain
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080]   patronage level.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.840]   If you're not a patron of the show, you can become a patron at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.040]   You'll find all the details there and then that will enable you to have access to this
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920]   call in line where you can call in and ask a question.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.320]   So thank you to all of you who do support the show as a patron.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.560]   Again, details at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.280]   Right now we've got three, oh, four, five.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   We've got five callers on the line.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.760]   So we're going to start with the first few that I know and then we'll see where we go
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   from there.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   We're going to kick it off with Chris in Minnesota.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.840]   Go ahead, Chris, and let me know what your question is and let's see how I can serve
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840]   you today.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   Hey, Josh.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   I really appreciate these.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   I think these are an awesome way.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   I agree with him.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   I think these are an awesome way.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.680]   I agree with you that radios need more caller participation.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.000]   So my question is around defined contribution benefit plans for pensions.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.320]   I work for a state government, which I'm sure you're not a big fan of, but I like it.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.280]   My question revolves around the, there are a lot of people who really don't like defined
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.360]   benefit pension plans because they lose a lot of their control over being able to decide
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   how they invest their money, what they're going to get for payouts, those kinds of things.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.200]   I was wondering whether you had any suggestions.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.960]   There's been talk about maybe allowing people to pull out of the defined benefit plan and
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.840]   invest in my 457 instead of a defined benefit plan.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.240]   I was just wondering what advice you could give me on that.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.000]   Are you asking the question because you have a specific decision that you need to make
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.360]   or just kind of generalized what are your thoughts on the subject in general?
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.800]   I don't have a decision I need to make yet, but there has been talk in the Minnesota legislature
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   of going ahead and removing the defined benefit plan and replacing it with a 401k style plan.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.120]   It would allow us to either continue in our benefit plan as current, the people who are
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.440]   already in can be grandfathered and maintain it until its end, or I can roll over into
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   a 457.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   Okay.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   All right.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   Let me give you just a little bit of background and explain this for the listeners and then
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.160]   we'll cover your particular situation.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.600]   The difference of these terms where we talk about a defined contribution versus a defined
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.680]   benefit plan is important and it indicates a difference of how the money is set aside.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:58.240]   So when we use the word pension, most people think of that word pension as meaning a steady
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.480]   stream of payments that's guaranteed by a government entity or by a large corporation.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.880]   So the best example here would be payments that are similar to what we all understand
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.180]   social security payments to be.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.260]   When you retire and when you file for social security, you're going to receive a steady
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.500]   stream of payments coming in no matter what happens behind the scenes.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.320]   You're not concerned with the balances in the account.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.260]   You're not concerned with whether there's money there or not.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260]   You're just going to get a check.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.160]   Government employees are the most common ones who have these, whether it's someone like
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.840]   you who's an employee of a state government or whether it's someone like a firefighter
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.240]   or a police officer.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.180]   We all know the benefits there.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.700]   If you know a firefighter who retired at 55 years old and they got $5,500 a month coming
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.280]   in for the rest of their life, that's because they were enrolled in a pension plan.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.060]   Now the term pension plan should be used, if used accurately, to be both a defined contribution
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.060]   and a defined benefit plan.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.180]   But in normal kind of non-financial planner speak, most people use the term pension plan
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.300]   to refer to that type of plan.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.620]   That type of plan is called a defined benefit plan.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.420]   The reason is because what's defined is not how much money you put into it, but how much
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.660]   your benefit is, the defined benefit.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:21.180]   That's why you can have a chart that says when you retire at the age of say 60 years
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.380]   old, you're going to receive 75% of your final year's salary.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.580]   There are some variations to that formula.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.940]   But all defined benefit plans are calculated based upon the actual benefit amount that
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.100]   you're going to receive.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.840]   Then they're funded, ideally, enough to achieve that benefit amount.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.060]   Now that's contrasted with a defined contribution plan.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.860]   And this would be what we would usually understand as the standard structure of something like
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.780]   a 401k plan.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.860]   There are many other types of plans, not just 401ks, but we're most familiar with this 401k
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.060]   type of plan.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.860]   So under a defined contribution plan, you're not calculating how much the benefit is and
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.580]   the actual benefit is not being guaranteed.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.340]   You're just simply have an amount that you can contribute.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.380]   So we know, okay, you can put $16,000 into your 401k plan.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.260]   And then we don't know how much it's going to be in the future, but we're just guaranteeing
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.460]   that this amount is going to be put in.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.540]   We're defining the contribution.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.580]   We don't know what the benefit amount is going to be.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.860]   Now, historically, when companies provided pension plans for their employees, the majority
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.220]   of them used a defined benefit plan structure where they promised that when you retire,
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.160]   we'll pay you 60% of your final year's salary.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.980]   And this worked out pretty well for the employees because most people are pretty bad investors
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.620]   and they're not going to receive much.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.700]   They're not going to make good investment decisions.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.880]   They're not knowledgeable.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.260]   They're not emotionally stable enough to make good investment decisions.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.480]   And so under this circumstance, they didn't have to worry about it.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.100]   They just know they're going to get their check and their only job is to figure out
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.640]   how to depend on the check.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.540]   This was also good because it kept professional investors in charge of the funds where the
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.580]   professional investment managers probably had enough expertise and knowledge to make
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.340]   good investment decisions and they were trained and there were mechanisms in force to help
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.040]   them to keep them from responding emotionally, not making bad decisions just simply because
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.680]   of a market up or down.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.820]   So these plans worked out really well for the retirees and they worked out well for
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.500]   the investment managers.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.560]   What didn't work out well was for the companies who were sponsoring them because when you
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.300]   promise to pay a certain amount of benefit in the future, you have to fund that plan
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.280]   and the company has to set aside out of its money a certain amount to fund that plan.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.860]   And so the actuaries every year on these types of plans, the actuaries every year are sitting
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.760]   down and they're calculating how much money do we need in the pot in order to pay out
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.360]   these benefits to our retirees.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.440]   So this put the companies on the hook.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.260]   Well, once the cat got out of the bag with companies realizing that they could start
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:17.360]   to use the defined contribution plan, most popularly the 401k profit sharing plan which
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.760]   technically is a profit sharing plan where individuals can make their contributions to
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.780]   it, make your 401k contributions to it, then they realize the benefit.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.240]   The benefit is that the company is not on the hook to guarantee your retirement check.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.480]   All they have to do is just write a check up front for the amount of their match and
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.120]   you're on the hook for it.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.880]   Now people who are participating in the 401k plans often like these types of plans especially
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.640]   if you're a savvy investor.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.120]   It's possible that you could invest more aggressively.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.800]   It's possible that you could invest more wisely and that you could come out on the other side
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.840]   with far more money.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.200]   And they like the fact that they would have access to the money in the term of a lump
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.920]   sum instead of just you're going to get $6,000 a month.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.200]   I might have a million or $2 million in this account in theory.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.760]   So it's very much a matter of competing priorities and it's a real question as far as what's
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.400]   better for me and how am I actually going to navigate it.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.880]   Which brings us to today.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.360]   One of the pressures that's on most large companies have done away with a defined benefit
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.480]   plan and they've transitioned over to a defined contribution plan.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.720]   You will sometimes see defined benefit plans.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.680]   People more often see them as a form of executive compensation rather than for rank and file
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.000]   employees.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.440]   The 401k type of plan has really swept across the marketplace and the companies really like
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   it.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.080]   If I were a business owner, I really would like having the 401k plan because I am not
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.040]   on the hook for future contributions.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.300]   But many governments have still been holding out and have still provided these defined
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   benefit plans.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.920]   And there are a couple of reasons for it.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.500]   You could say, well, maybe they're more conservative.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.060]   Maybe they feel this serves the interests of their participants.
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.060]   Maybe so.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.060]   I don't know.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.600]   Personally, I think that one major factor of this is that it's easier for politicians
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.840]   who have to face election to promise very strong retirement benefits and those retirement
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.440]   benefits to be in the future.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.500]   And depending on how the large investment markets are functioning at a certain time,
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.640]   they can get away with this or they cannot get away with this.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.960]   And the idea here is that if I'm an elected politician and Chris is a state government
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   employee, I know I've got to keep my state government employees happy.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:46.240]   I've got a limited amount of tax revenue and I've got to figure out how do I keep my employees
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.960]   happy, keep my union representatives happy without going over my budget.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.000]   Well, if I promise a bigger retirement plan in the future, then I don't have to pay for
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.360]   that today and some future politician's got to deal with it.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.000]   No, by the way, we're in a strong period of strong market performance and so we can figure
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.960]   that our investment plans will probably get about 10 or 11 percent.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960]   We've got plenty of money.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.360]   Our actuarial calculations are doing fine.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.280]   And this is what has happened to a lot of governments where they – both local, municipal,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:24.320]   state – I can't confidently say federal because I haven't researched that, but it
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.560]   very much impacts local, municipal and state governments where they've promised very large
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.080]   retirement packages.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.240]   And if you speak with many local and municipal and state government employees, you'll find
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.160]   that they're primarily interested in their retirement package.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   The pay today is not great but they really love the retirement package and one benefit
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.960]   that they love is this guaranteed payout.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.560]   So the challenge, Chris – let's come back to your situation.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.840]   The challenge that anybody who is making this decision has to face is they have to look
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.720]   at their state's budget.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.800]   Some states are financed well and these funds are capitalized well and there hasn't been
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.840]   all kinds of skullduggery behind the scenes where the promises have been too high.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.640]   Rather, the funds are well capitalized.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.940]   They're in a good position and they're strong.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.040]   Some states, it's exactly the opposite.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   Some cities, it's exactly the opposite.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.560]   And your guarantee of a retirement program – of a retirement benefit is only as strong
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.160]   as the government entity and their taxing authorities' ability to deliver it.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.100]   And so it's a major challenge to sort through because it's so broken up and each city is
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.040]   different than another and each county is different than another and each state is different
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   than another.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.480]   So you've got to look at the specifics of your situation.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.820]   So that's the background, Chris.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.400]   Are you leaning towards one or another?
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:49.600]   Well, I guess my grandfather was always telling me about how wonderful a pension is because
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.280]   it's defined how much you're going to get and always get that and everybody who doesn't
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.040]   do that is dumb.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:02.520]   But he was not always the poster child for financial responsibility.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:10.080]   So I guess all I really know is that the defined benefit sounds great, but because I'm so young,
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.360]   I'm 24, I could afford to take a few more risks.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:21.240]   I could potentially earn more by being a little bit more risky now and have time to recoup
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.760]   if it doesn't go well.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.640]   It might make sense for me to pull out of the pension and go for the defined contribution
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.200]   if it becomes an option.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   I guess I'm not sure which way to lean.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.680]   I would lean more towards the pension if I were a bit older, but because I'm not, I'm
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.040]   not sure whether I should look at the...
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.560]   You took the next question was going to be how close you are to retirement.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.240]   If you're 24, you're quite a ways from retirement, especially within the context of the pension
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   plan.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.520]   So a couple of things that I think would be your major factors that you would need to
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.280]   weigh in making this decision.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.680]   Number one, do you know anything about the health of your state's pension fund and how
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.160]   well funded it is?
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:13.280]   Yes, it is currently funded at 88% and they have a whole bunch of weird rules that indicate
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.720]   as soon as it gets up to, or as soon as it gets down to 85%, then the employer share
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   goes up from the currently the employee and the employer both chip in 5.5%.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.360]   If it comes down to 85% funded, then the employer share goes up to 6.8%.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:38.480]   And then if it drops all the way down to 75% funded, then the employee share comes up to
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   6.8% as well.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.240]   The challenge with the funding things, and this is where you've got to look deeply at
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.040]   it, and I would search carefully to see if there's somebody who's carefully analyzing
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.840]   your pension program.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.240]   But I don't know all of the rules on how they report those ratings of how well funded it
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   is.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.080]   So does that mean when they say this is well funded, does that mean that they have this
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.280]   amount of money sitting in reserve assets, which are currently capable of doing that?
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.200]   Or are they counting on future contributions?
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.360]   My guess would be that would be the first one, but I have very little confidence in
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   people's willingness to disclose difficult facts.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:29.360]   And the challenge for states and local municipal governments with regard to funding their pension
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.600]   obligations, the challenge they have that the federal government doesn't have, is that
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.920]   people find it very easy to move out of one tax jurisdiction into another.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:45.520]   So if things start to become a problem, then the situation starts to get bad, people will
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.120]   quickly move from one county to the next, one municipality to the next, one state to
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.280]   the next even.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.080]   And so a lot of times, the assumption of revenue, the assumption of the tax base, the assumption
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.520]   of those things that's being calculated, starts to break down when you encounter population
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.120]   shifts.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.800]   I don't know how to give you advice on that without reviewing in detail your plan, and
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.920]   I think that would put me beyond where either I have the interest or the legal ability to
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.720]   do without going in a rough direction.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.780]   But I would encourage you to dig deeply into your state and see.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:25.560]   At this point in time, I have, in the coming decades, especially given your age, in the
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:33.600]   coming decades, I think that the trend will be that many local municipalities and state
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.680]   governments will start to face more and more significant financial headwinds.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.820]   When you look at some of the early warning signs of some of the different municipalities
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.520]   that have declared bankruptcy over the last couple of years, and you watch and you see
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.740]   what's gone on, you see the trend.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:57.280]   Now the problem with it is that I don't see any immediate fear.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.040]   For example, people are often talking about, "Well, everything's going to collapse this
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   year."
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.380]   No, that's not what happens.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.760]   It happens over a period of time.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.720]   It happens over decades and decades.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.680]   But I don't see how, with the structure that many governments have brought onto themselves,
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.800]   I don't see how they can maintain it over time.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.200]   And so what will happen is, politically, the pensioners will get stiffed.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.760]   And that's happened many, many times with all the municipalities.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.180]   Many, many, it would be too strong of a statement.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.480]   That's happened many times with the municipalities which have gone bankrupt over the last couple
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.740]   of years.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.960]   So I would consider that and research it carefully.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.700]   And I would generally trend towards not trusting at first, but I would allow myself to be open
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.780]   if I could trust it.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.160]   For example, when I was with Northwestern Mutual, I had a pension plan, a traditional
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.400]   defined benefit plan, and I dug into it.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.760]   The company was very financially strong.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.960]   There was a long track record, and I really liked having that traditional defined benefit
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.840]   plan because I was confident in its funding and its performance.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.540]   So I like the structure of a defined benefit plan if it's well-funded.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.440]   But the question is, is it well-funded?
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.840]   The second thing that I would consider if I were you would be how long you intend to
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.520]   be at this employer.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.140]   A defined benefit plan usually has a relatively long vesting schedule.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.360]   And in order for you to benefit from it, you're going to want to be there for a long time.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.860]   And that's sometimes hard to predict.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.740]   How confident are you that you've been at this employer for a long time and you're going
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.080]   to be there for a long time?
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.200]   Pretty confident or less confident?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.720]   Reasonably confident.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.280]   My employer has a different style of vesting structure where after five years, you are
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.440]   eligible to receive your full benefit, but then they prorate the benefit based off of
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:55.000]   your years of service as opposed to a 25%, 50% sort of thing.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.880]   It's a 1.7% for every year of service.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:08.160]   And so after five years, I'm eligible for the full benefit I can achieve, but it is
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.800]   variant based off of how long I stay here.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.520]   But I also really like what I'm doing.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:20.360]   I'm trying to reduce regulation and improve our government's ability to actually function
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.960]   without being strapped for money and all the rest.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.880]   I increase efficiency.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.880]   I think it's a good mission.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.400]   And so I like being here.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.480]   I think I might be here for a good while longer.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.880]   Well, if you can survive, I hope you can and I hope you can do the work.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.000]   If you're going to be there for a long time and if your plan is well-funded, I think they're
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.720]   really, really strong.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:52.120]   I love doing retirement planning for a couple where they have a defined benefit plan of
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.840]   some kind to rely on because it solves that major problem of having a floor under your
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.200]   income and it helps you to be more aggressive in other areas of investing.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.320]   When I used to work with clients, I would always use this example when it came to retirement
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   planning.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   Remember 2008?
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   And I said, "Remember that and think of your friends."
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.000]   Everyone has a friend where one of the person where the husband is a retired firefighter
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.920]   and the wife is a retired teacher and they're living just on their pension income, their
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.800]   defined benefit income.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.640]   How nervous or uncomfortable were they in 2008?
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.760]   Not very.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.520]   Way less nervous and uncomfortable than the retired executive where all of his money was
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.560]   sitting in a 401k and he's sitting there looking at his stock values and saying, "What am I
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.940]   going to do?"
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.860]   So that confidence that you can have when you have a guaranteed number is really powerful
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.120]   in planning and I think it should be given some priority.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.960]   That doesn't mean that you can't additionally invest to get what you're hoping for to be
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.240]   higher returns from another place.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.160]   So given the facts that you have described to me, I would investigate the health of it
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:05.840]   and I would probably lean toward pursuing it myself and I would lean away from investing
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:11.200]   in the 401k at least if my choice was either/or.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.020]   I think you're a good candidate for the defined benefit plan if you can verify and keep your
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.720]   eyes on those factors.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.440]   All right, next let's go to Rocky.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.440]   How can I serve you today?
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.440]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.100]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.480]   Today my question is more of a behavior question versus tactical.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:39.160]   As I talk to people who achieve financial success and that just means that they've been
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:45.600]   able to build up a decent retirement account and I read books, it seems to come down to
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.800]   two simple principles.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:54.240]   One is spend less than you earn and the second principle is take that amount that you've
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.280]   saved and invest it, save it, do something to make it grow.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.920]   Every time I sit down and I talk to these guys, they all say the same thing.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.200]   It's these two simple things and then we scratch our heads and we have this one big
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.920]   question I have never been able to find the answer to.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.680]   Why don't more people just do those two simple steps?
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.800]   So that's my question for you.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   What do you think?
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   What's your opinion on the subject?
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.520]   You know, I think it's probably two things.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:37.640]   One, I don't know that everyone is taught that and two, there's no money in delivering
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.180]   that message.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.080]   So you know, the auto dealer is not going to deliver it.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.520]   The guy, you know, selling stuff at Walmart is not going to deliver it.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.960]   Your boss doesn't want you to retire.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.560]   He wants you to keep working for him.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.120]   So I think people in general are probably or people just want more and then they have
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   to balance.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.480]   So there's no money in selling that message to people for the most part except maybe for
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.040]   the financial planner.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.640]   If I could answer that question, I could probably get rich off of answering that question.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.040]   So because you're right, it is the fundamental.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.240]   I'm looking for your answer.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   There we go.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   All right.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.880]   Well, I'll give you some ideas and these are probably more speculative.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.920]   I haven't done a PhD dissertation on it.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:32.920]   But when you look at people in my informal survey of stories that I've read and people
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:38.560]   that I've talked to, I think one of the strongest influences behind whether or not somebody will
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:45.280]   put into practice those simple routines is their example, either the positive example
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.180]   or the negative example.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:54.600]   So we know for whatever reason that in general society's wealth, wealth distribution, income
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.000]   distribution is going to be generally governed by the Pareto principle.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.480]   20% of the population is going to own 80% of the wealth.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.600]   20% of the population is going to earn 80% of the income.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.480]   80% of the population is going to earn 20% of the wealth.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.560]   I don't know why that is.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.760]   I've never read a satisfactory explanation of why the Pareto principle seems to hold
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.840]   so consistent, but it seems to be consistent in just about anywhere under just about any
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   system.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.000]   So if you recognize that, that means that 80% of the population is only holding 20%
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.800]   of the wealth and is only holding 20% of the income.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.880]   That means that 80% of the population is seeing a negative example.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.320]   Only about 20% of the population is seeing a positive example.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.960]   And then the higher you go in the numbers, the Pareto holds true at every distribution
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.360]   of income and wealth.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:52.480]   The top 20% of the top 20%, so that would be the top 4%, own 80% of the top 80% of income.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.580]   So that's where you get into that 64%.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.000]   And you can follow these distributions along.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.400]   So what that means is that very few people are going to have a positive example.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.240]   And many times when you talk to people who are wealthy, they'll trace back to a positive
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.000]   example in their life.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.200]   Usually, hopefully a parent, because mom and dad are the parents who have the most
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.640]   influence in their children's life.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.160]   But sometimes it's also an uncle or it's a grandfather or it's a business person in the
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.840]   community or somebody else that they looked up to and somebody who took a mentor role.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.380]   If somebody is given a positive example, I think that can make a big difference.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.160]   You also see the strong negative example, where many times you're speaking with somebody
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.280]   and they had just this strong negative example from their family.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.200]   We were so broke, we couldn't afford any food.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   And I said, "That's it.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.240]   We're not going to do this again.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.160]   I'm going to learn what I need to learn."
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.800]   But most people aren't in those extremes.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.240]   They don't have that strong positive example and they don't have that strong negative example,
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.560]   or at least they're not able to respond to the negative example by completely changing
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.560]   something.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.800]   So most people just kind of are lackadaisical.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.120]   They continue on the way that they've mostly continued on.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.560]   And when you recognize that the majority of people are going to continue on in kind of
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.320]   a mediocre way, it means that the majority of the population continues on in a mediocre
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   way.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.440]   It's not that the majority of the population is completely poor, at least not in the United
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.920]   States, and it's not that they're completely rich.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.680]   They're just kind of average.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.640]   And that's what you see with many people is when they've got to come up with some money
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   to pay a bill, they come up with the money to pay the bill.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.960]   When they've got to get something done, they get something done.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.560]   But they're not proactive about changing that.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.920]   So the first thing I think is the power of example, which is why it's so important for
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:39.120]   us to be a clear example and to be vocal about our example for our children, for our community,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   for the people that are around us.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.260]   Number two is training.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:47.040]   So when you get to the topic of proactive training, there's strong evidence to say that
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.560]   if you can train somebody diligently, you can help to change their behavior over time.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.920]   But that requires something that's even additional to example, and it requires training.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.400]   So when I work with a family, I'm working with a family right now that's in a crisis,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.480]   just a local family here in my community, and they're in a financial crisis, training
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.880]   is tough.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.640]   And walking them through all the basics, step by step by step by step, it requires hours
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.000]   of my time and a tremendous amount of emotional energy.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.600]   So few people are going to provide that training, but that training is what is needed.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.840]   I think one of the challenges is that we constantly face the opposite training, and there are
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.920]   some social influences that are constantly working on us.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.320]   So advertising would be an excellent one.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.520]   I've dug into a little bit of the subject.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.620]   There's some good books written on the amount of advertising that our children see from
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.080]   a young age.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.120]   It's relentless.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.360]   And the advertisers are very intelligent about it to specifically target our children from
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:52.200]   a very young age with specific brands, with specific messages, with advertising content
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.360]   that's specifically tailored to them.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.200]   Now if you factor in, let's talk about the amount of television advertising, you factor
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.360]   in the way that the average family functions, that you kind of just, and I'll build a little
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.040]   bit of an archetype here, but calculate the amount of time that the average child spends
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:15.520]   sitting in front of the television, calculate the total ad impressions that that child faces
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.920]   through that TV channel and through other channels as well.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.320]   I don't have the data in my fingertips to cite, but just go with the concept.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:29.640]   Calculate the number of hours that are faced there and then calculate how much time the
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   average parent actually spends with their young child.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.400]   That number is extremely low.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.620]   And then calculate the amount of time that the average parent actually spends with their
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:44.600]   child in a period of focused example and in a period of focused training.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.840]   It's not very much.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.020]   And so you've got this massive dominance of advertising messages that are carefully designed
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:57.800]   and tailored to appeal to the child's desires.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.840]   Child psychology and all of those things are well understood, so let's build this advertising
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.840]   machine.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.260]   And then on the flip side, there's not a lot of proactive training, and so most people
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.040]   have very little self-defense against advertising.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.720]   So I think that makes a big difference.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.760]   You can look at how conformity is taught throughout culture.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.320]   One of the most powerful lessons that we learn from the government school system is the power
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.600]   and the importance of conformity.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.000]   You know that if you don't fit in, life is going to be unpleasant with you.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.880]   And so I've seen good arguments.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.500]   I wouldn't necessarily stand up and preach them myself, but I've seen persuasive arguments
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:39.200]   that one of the major functions that comes out of the system of formal, universal, standardized
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   government schooling is that you create a population that is easily controlled and easily
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.800]   sold to.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.120]   You can know if you go into just about any group of young people or just about any peer
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.800]   group, you can probably find the hot buttons that you can push and that you can sell to.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.040]   And that's what advertisers know.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.920]   I used to work in the business very briefly as a junior-level analyst, and we would analyze
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.480]   different population groups, and we would analyze them for their triggers.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.800]   And so I spent a lot of time working in different areas, but the best example would be something
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.520]   like fast food or we did some consumer packaged goods surveys.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.840]   And when you get into the world of advertising, it's very, very carefully constructed.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:28.080]   And so you find a peer group of people that are similar, and you find out what their buttons
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   are, and you figure out how do I associate a message that's going to be impactful for
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.080]   this type of person.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.520]   I'll give you one simple example.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.800]   When I was working with the company that I worked with, we were doing a large research
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.720]   study for a specific type of new light beer that was going to be introduced.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.600]   And this light beer was being presented by a large well-known brand.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.560]   And they were trying to figure out what was the, in the advertising speak, what's the
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.960]   white space opportunity?
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:05.280]   What's the market segment that we can identify that we can exploit with our advertising message?
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.560]   So they had a beer that had all of the basic flavor and taste, et cetera, but it was a
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.840]   light beer and it was a luxury beer.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.520]   And what they realized is that the marketing segment that they needed to fit was they needed
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.120]   to fit somebody who liked to drink lots of beer, so they were looking for a light beer,
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.800]   and they didn't want to be weighed down when they were in a social situation, but they
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.360]   didn't want to appear as basic or they didn't want to look like a redneck.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.440]   They didn't want to hold a Bud Light in their hand because they looked like a redneck.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   They wanted to look sophisticated.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.600]   And so all of the advertising message was around what that bottle looked like in their
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.080]   hands, that they looked like somebody that was sophisticated.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:49.040]   They looked like somebody that was an elitist in terms of their social standing, but yet
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.440]   they could still drink and drink without getting filled up over time.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.880]   So the point is there's a lot of conformity in different people groups, and I think that
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.600]   has a tremendous influence on people.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.640]   Very few people would go out and make the purchasing decisions that they did if they
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.360]   weren't influenced to some extent by their peer group.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.840]   And the final idea I have is just simply if you look at the amount of the thinking time
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:18.240]   span that most people tend to have, for you to defer gratification and to delay gratification
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:24.440]   to the future, you have to have an ability to think and to plan on a longer time span.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.600]   And there have been a number of research reports that have done it.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.160]   I mean, the famous one would be the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment that I believe I've
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.800]   seen that verified, and you have to be careful with studies because sometimes you hear something
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.080]   and it's not true.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.400]   But I've verified that one a couple of times, and I'm confident that that one is accurate.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.560]   And the idea here was they followed some students.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.440]   They put students in a room and they said, "You have a choice.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.160]   If you can have one marshmallow now or if you can wait five minutes, you can have two
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   marshmallows."
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.920]   And then the researcher would leave the room with one marshmallow sitting on the table
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.520]   in front of them.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   And they came back after a few minutes, and some percentage of the students, of the little
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.000]   children, went ahead and just ate the one marshmallow.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.480]   Some percentage were able to defer their gratification and wait for the two for a few minutes later.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.240]   And they followed those people throughout their life, and they found that of those who
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:16.600]   were able to delay gratification, they were able to amass more wealth, gain a higher level
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   of income.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.480]   Well, look around and ask yourself, is there somebody or something or some influence in
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.840]   society at large that's teaching children to delay gratification?
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.780]   In general, my observation is no.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.000]   We don't teach delayed gratification.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.640]   Some people seem to have it naturally.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.960]   I don't know what influences that, but we don't teach it.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.760]   And so if we're not going to teach that, when you start adding these things together,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.560]   the fact that most people don't have any desire or experience or practice delaying gratification,
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.040]   they don't have a strong example of how they can build wealth.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.780]   They think that they need to play the lottery to build wealth.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.440]   They don't have a lot of proactive training because that's very time-consuming for a parent
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440]   to do.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.280]   And you flip it and you add all the negative examples, the fact that they're marketed to
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.720]   constantly without having any positive instruction or training that's anywhere near the amount
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.520]   of time that the advertisers have with our children.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:19.000]   You look at the way that society is structured and has a lot of conformity and conformity
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.560]   is encouraged.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.520]   You start to add these things together, and to me, it's not a surprise that people are
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   not wealthy.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.400]   It's a bigger surprise to me that more people are not poor, and that's the magic of the
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.200]   free enterprise system where there's still an opportunity for people to break it out.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   So those are some of my ideas.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.840]   Rocky, what say you?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:46.040]   I think I agree with everything you've said, and I guess the question is, can we do something
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040]   about it?
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:52.600]   But I think at the end of the day, there's just going to be 20% of us who have it and
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:58.640]   80% who don't, and that's just going to be life.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:04.720]   It's funny because when I look at how I'm raising my kids, we don't follow any of those
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.100]   things that you've talked about.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:12.720]   So there's no TV advertising, for the most part, or if we see ads, we talk about the
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.840]   ads and how they're looking for things.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.360]   We don't teach conformity.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.120]   We kind of make our own path.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.840]   And so my kids are growing up financially strong.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.160]   I think we just did that.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.440]   You're helping to put in words why those things are occurring and why it is.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.880]   So yeah, I think I agree with you.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.840]   And until people want to change, I guess they won't.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.840]   Right.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.840]   It's the same from my experience.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   So here's some things that we can do.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.400]   And just to corroborate what you're saying, my experience is the same, that my parents
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.560]   had very little advertising in the house.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.080]   We never had a TV growing up.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.120]   I spent most of my time reading books, only a few magazines.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:02.800]   I was outside of many of the mainstream kind of socially conforming pressures for the formative
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   years.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   I only went to a private school starting in about seventh grade, with the exception of
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.040]   one year that I was in a government school in third grade.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.200]   I was educated at home for the first six years, and those are the most formative years.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:20.880]   And I actually vividly remember how I had no concept of peer pressure going into seventh
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.880]   grade.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:28.720]   I had no concept of, for example, fitting in and the cool kids and the uncool kids.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.280]   Because I was surrounded in the home education environment, I was surrounded by people who
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.680]   took me and accepted me as I was, without any pressure to conform, without any stylistic
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.680]   cues.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.960]   I didn't know you had to wear a certain kind of shoe, wear a certain kind of shirt, comb
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.520]   your hair in such a way.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.160]   I had no concept of those things.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.640]   It actually took me about a year of being in a private school where I learned about
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.920]   cliques and I learned about peer groups and I learned about peer pressure.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:59.120]   And most of the things that I regret from high school, the times that I was rude and
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.040]   ugly to people and the things that I did that were just foolish, were after it took me about
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:08.320]   a year after I learned that, "Wait a second, I'm supposed to fit in and how do I do that?"
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.880]   But that stood me well and it prepared me to be able to stand alone.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.320]   I have no problem standing alone in an unpopular opinion or holding something that's a bit
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.860]   countercultural myself.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:24.540]   And so that's been a major help to me when it comes to building wealth, to have that
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.060]   trained.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.740]   And I also had some of the positive examples, positive training and I had a lot of negative
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.460]   examples, things I learned the hard way where I said, "I'm not going to do that again."
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.600]   And so you can do that.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   You can break out.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.440]   I think the biggest thing that we can do is number one, work with our kids, work diligently
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.960]   and proactively, restrict the influences that are going to be negative and are going to
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.520]   have a desultory influence in their life.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.320]   Pull those things out.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   Work to establish them as an individual first before exposing them to the onslaught of advertising.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.320]   Training them.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:05.400]   Anytime I take my children with me to a store or something like that, I get so, those are
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.520]   the best training opportunities.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.920]   I get a little bit sad when I see parents who, the first thing they do, go to Costco
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.560]   and here's a digital game or here's a cell phone and you should be spending your time
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   on the cell phone.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.720]   Well, you're missing out on the training opportunity.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.520]   Let's talk about value comparison.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.400]   Let's talk about why we're shopping at one store versus another.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.440]   Let's talk about all of these different influences and use those as proactive training.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:34.600]   The proactive training that we can do where we can help put in place systems, training
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:39.720]   in budgeting, training in savings, put situations in place where we're teaching them the value
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.840]   of delayed gratification.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.320]   I'm convinced these are skills that can be taught and can be acquired.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.760]   They're not just some kind of genetic lottery that we win and we either have them or we
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   don't.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.120]   Certainly, there may be a natural predisposition in one direction or another, but it's a skill
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.360]   that can be learned.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.840]   And then that can extend out.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.320]   We have the most influence over our children.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.160]   Next we can go out into our social groups, into our more extended families and one by
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.440]   one you can impact people by and large.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.120]   I don't know if it's possible to change the 80%.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.280]   I don't know.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:23.200]   I've never fully understood why that principle seems to hold constant in seemingly every
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   society and seemingly every aspect of life.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.760]   So I don't know why that's the case.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.120]   I just know that it is the case.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:36.520]   But what I do think you can do is you can, whether or not we can move more wealth down
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.440]   so that more people in the lower ages are able to have wealth, I don't know.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.560]   But I do know we can move people up.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.560]   And you can move somebody from the bottom 80% to the top 20%.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.480]   And you can then move somebody from the bottom 80% of the top 20% into the top 20% of the
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   top 20%.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.360]   Now, can you go farther without natural inclination?
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.460]   I don't know.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.780]   But I know we can make an impact one by one.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:06.440]   And as the old story goes about the person walking down the beach throwing sand dollars
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.780]   back into the ocean, no, you can't throw all the sand dollars back into the ocean.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:16.720]   But it can make a difference to the one that you throw.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   Anything to add, Grocky?
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   Nope.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.200]   I think we've done a great job of covering it.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Cool.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.760]   Let's go on now to, let's see, Daria.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.280]   Go ahead and let me know what's going on with you.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   I want to see how I can serve you today, please.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.960]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.160]   Well, first of all, thank you for all the work that you do.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.360]   I refresh my iTunes feed every day several times with something from you.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.960]   And then I also wholeheartedly agree with what you said in the previous question.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.280]   I think it's a painful question for me.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   But I agree with all what you said.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.840]   And I grew up without ads because I grew up in a USSR that no longer exists, where ads
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840]   didn't exist.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.520]   So I know how it feels with and without.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:09.320]   But to my question is, I see an opportunity in the next several months to be independent
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.120]   in terms of work for myself.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.560]   And the work would be consulting type of work for BISEC.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:24.400]   So I was wondering what kind of things I should think about setting up this.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:30.800]   For example, I understand that maybe LLC is the better way to go, that some other options,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.440]   there are probably some tax implications that I should start thinking about.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:40.280]   If you could give me your ideas about where to start trying to make sure that at the end
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.920]   of the year of my self-employment, I'm not finding myself doing something illegal or
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.360]   not filing enough taxes or just tripping up.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.360]   Okay.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.440]   That's a good question.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.840]   Are you already doing the consulting work and being paid for it?
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.360]   No, because I am employed by a company.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:08.240]   But my idea is to stop the employment at a certain point in time.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.340]   And then I have enough money saved to sustain the transition.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:18.880]   And I have enough connection made and I see the market opportunity where I can sit in
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.120]   to start it.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.880]   So this is the idea.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:30.360]   Do you have the legal ability, for example, hopefully you don't have a non-compete or
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.360]   something like that.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.440]   Do you have the legal ability to start taking on a couple of consulting clients while you
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.560]   continue to be employed at your current job?
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:45.280]   This is a good question, which I am trying to figure out with our legal team and see
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.960]   what my contract says.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:55.440]   But let's assume that I don't while I'm employed and let's assume that once I am not employed
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.720]   I can start right away without waiting for any certain period of time.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.160]   So when you're starting something like a consulting business, let's first talk about the business
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:11.240]   aspect and then we'll go to the nuts and bolts of accounts and taxes, etc.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:16.960]   The big thing with any new business is to make sure that you actually have a market.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.800]   And I don't need to know all that much about your business history.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.640]   I'm going to speak generally and you can pull from it what's applicable to you, Daria.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.880]   But generally people who are excited about going off and starting a business, if you
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.760]   haven't done it before, you might get excited about the wrong things.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.880]   And the thing that matters when going and starting a new business is can I get customers
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.740]   and can I make sales?
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:44.040]   And so you should practice that as much as possible in the lowest possible risk way.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.160]   So if there's any way that you can go off and start the practice of getting customers
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.640]   and proving your systems and making sure that you can actually convert somebody from an
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.800]   interested prospect into a paying client, if you can do that now, go do it now.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.680]   I advise don't worry about any of the technicalities until you've gone and gotten a customer, until
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.360]   you've gone and proved it.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.720]   So many times I see people that are wanting to start new businesses and I always just
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.460]   pick on someone like a photographer.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:20.920]   You don't need a business card, you don't need a website, you don't need an LLC, you
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.220]   don't need a business bank account, you don't need to file a business tax return.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.580]   You need to go get a paying customer.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.760]   So if you've got a camera, go take pictures of somebody and get somebody to pay you money.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.860]   And you can deal with all the technical stuff after the fact.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.120]   Same thing with consulting.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:39.680]   You need to go and get somebody to pay you money so you can prove there is actually money
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   here.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:46.000]   Now, of course, there are going to be many areas where the path of a consultant is well-proven
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.080]   and you can walk in the footsteps of somebody who's already done it and you can do it yourself.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.400]   There are many industries that you can do it.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.760]   So if you have a legally binding contract, if you want to do consulting in an industry
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:03.200]   that you're in and you can't go and do it on the side, then that's fine.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.260]   What I would be doing in those circumstances is I would be working hard to build and establish
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:15.720]   my brand and becoming a known quantity in my field even if I'm not providing actual
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.320]   consulting services.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.720]   And it would be a rare contract.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.440]   It would only be something like where I came from in financial services.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.880]   It would be a rare business where you can't do that while you have your job.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.200]   And so you should be working as hard as you can on your marketing and on building and
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.520]   establishing your reputation before you go ahead and make that jump.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.120]   Now when you go and make the jump, what do you need to do?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.400]   In the beginning, it's relatively simple.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.280]   The first most important thing you can do is to establish a separate bank account for
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.800]   your business.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.780]   This can be a business account and you should in your mind call it a business account.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.800]   Whether it is an actual business account or whether it's just a personal checking account
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.880]   that you're using as a business account doesn't really matter that much.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.720]   But you need to establish a separate bank account.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.480]   And then anything that you do that's associated with your business, you pay out of that bank
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   account.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.440]   And any money that comes into your business, you put into that bank account.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.160]   And it doesn't matter if it goes into the bank account and then you do an electronic
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.400]   transfer from your bank the very next day to your personal account.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   That's fine.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.120]   The key is it's got to be run through that bank account because that will help you with
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.100]   the very simplest of records.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.760]   And with something like a consulting business where it's just you, you're not going to
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.960]   have employees in the short term, it's going to be very, very simple.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.240]   Simple is fine.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.080]   And by just establishing and keeping a separate bank account with separate records on that
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.200]   bank account, you'll have the equivalent of a profit and loss statement which you need
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.520]   every month at the end of the month.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.360]   You look in that check register and you say, "Is there money here?"
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.280]   If there's money there, that means you're making money.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.600]   If there's not money there, that means you're not.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.920]   And so it's pretty simple to sit down and figure out if you're making money.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.960]   So you do need to establish a separate business bank account.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.920]   Now depending on the type of consulting, you may or may not want an entity.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.020]   Business entities, my opinion, are overrated.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.360]   People get bogged down in the details and then they don't go and do anything.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:14.120]   A business entity will protect you from some liability.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.920]   But in something like a consulting business, you've got to look carefully and understand
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   what is my actual liability.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:28.560]   For example, when I was a financial planner, my primary liability that I faced was not
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.560]   a professional liability.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.240]   The primary liability was professional liability that I would give bad advice.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:39.080]   And so having a financial planning business owned in a separate entity like an LLC wouldn't
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.640]   make any difference to the quality of my advice.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.620]   That was where I protected against that liability with something like errors and omissions insurance.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.760]   So it was a different liability.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.040]   The business of a consultant has very different liabilities than the business of a local concrete
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.120]   manufacturer.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.500]   If you're running a concrete plant and you've got a bunch of guys that are driving concrete
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.760]   trucks all over town, you've got a different kind of liability.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.460]   You've got employees now who might hit some little girl crossing the road and now you've
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.560]   got a lawsuit on your hands.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.600]   Well, in that situation, an LLC and a business type of entity will protect you from that.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.200]   But it doesn't protect you from giving bad advice.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:20.640]   A doctor doesn't need an LLC to protect him from bad medical advice.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.820]   A doctor needs malpractice insurance.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:28.560]   So look at your liability and understand what the advantages and disadvantages are.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   If I were just getting started as a consultant, would I start an LLC?
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   Maybe.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:38.880]   It's really, really simple to go on to your state's website and file just a standard boilerplate
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.880]   LLC.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.880]   It'll cost you 50 bucks.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.880]   You do a report once a year.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.240]   It's a pretty simple thing to do.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.240]   But you don't have to.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:49.620]   You can just file what's called a Schedule C and just operate the business as a sole
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.100]   proprietorship.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.160]   So the key is go out and get the business profitable.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.460]   As you get the business profitable, at that point in time, you can go ahead and start
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.820]   to hire the advice that you need.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.480]   You can go ahead and start to hire the advice of how to structure things.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.280]   You can go ahead and afford to pay for good bookkeeping.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.540]   You can go ahead and afford to pay for good financial advice.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.140]   All of those things will come with time.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.380]   But the key is to get the business off the ground.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.860]   The couple things that you do want to do.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:20.540]   As you're earning money with regard to your taxes, you want to pay quarterly taxes.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:26.300]   Basically take about 20% of what you're making-ish of your profit and send that to the IRS in
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.220]   the form of your quarterly taxes.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.980]   You want to make sure that you're doing that so that you're keeping pace on the amount
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.240]   of quarterly taxes that you're paying.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.540]   Your accountant will be the one who will work through that with you.
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.860]   They'll give you the forms and the little slips that you send in to the treasury when
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.300]   you're paying your taxes.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.620]   Or if you're using your own tax preparation program, they'll print those out for you as
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.620]   well.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.900]   But beyond that, it's pretty simple.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.380]   When most of the work is on the side of the business, not so much on the side of the technical
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.580]   planning.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:59.580]   Once you get down the road, once you're making a good amount of money, then you can come
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.580]   back and reassess your planning and make sure that you've got all those things buttoned
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:03.580]   up.
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:04.580]   Perfect.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.580]   Well, thanks so much.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.580]   These are all great points.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.580]   Now I know what to do, at least the first steps.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.580]   And just to give you some good context about the great thing that you said, I think it's
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.580]   important to know that you're not just doing this for the money.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.580]   You're doing it for the business.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:11.580]   You're doing it for the people.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.580]   You're doing it for the people.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.580]   You're doing it for the people.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.580]   You're doing it for the people.
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.580]   You're doing it for the people.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:16.580]   You're doing it for the people.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.740]   And just to give you some good context about the great thing that you said about the fact
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.860]   that people jump to a business without understanding their market.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:28.140]   So I'm in a situation where my husband moves to a different state and I have to quit the
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.140]   job.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:35.540]   But what I told my employer is that I actually do not want to quit fully.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.420]   I want to continue to provide my work, but if we can do it on a contract basis or whatever,
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.780]   a consulting basis, that would be great.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:46.620]   Of course, it may or may not happen, but for me, it's a great opportunity instead of
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.100]   going right away and trying to find a job in a different state.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:56.460]   I want to explore and see how it works, especially given that I can be on social benefits, on
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:00.500]   all kinds of benefits on my husband's new job.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:07.020]   And yeah, but I heard what you said and I think these are great points and I'm also
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:13.900]   going to speak with some of my friends who have done this to see what other things they
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:20.100]   encountered as independent consultants and what worked and what didn't for them.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.900]   The situation that you're describing is really ideal for the purposes of setting up a consulting
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:25.940]   business.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:30.640]   If you can use your husband's group benefits to provide for your needs for things like
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:38.780]   health insurance, etc., and if you can use your employer as your first major contract,
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:45.020]   that can set you up to launch the new business and that can give you the stability to go
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.340]   ahead and bring on new clients.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.340]   That sounds like a perfect fit to me.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:53.540]   The couple of things that you just want to do is let me not skip past, make sure that
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:59.020]   you're using that or that you've established that business bank account today and then
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.180]   use that bank account at all stages.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:07.160]   So for example, if you're going and taking your employer to lunch to talk to them about
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:16.140]   your possibly working with them on a contract basis instead of a wage-based, that lunch
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.420]   appointment qualifies you as a meals and entertainment expense.
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:25.380]   So 50% of that will be a deductible expense to your profits and you need to get in the
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.840]   habit of tracking those things from the beginning.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.480]   So make sure you don't short-circuit that and then if you're moving or things like that,
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.300]   make sure that you're counting and carefully tracking the miles that you're putting on
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.460]   your vehicle.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:42.700]   That'll be a substantial savings for most people to be able to deduct your mileage expense,
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.080]   especially if there's travel involved.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.780]   If you're traveling on an airplane, make sure that you're tracking those details and that
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.540]   you're making note of what you're doing.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:55.260]   If you're traveling into town and you're flying back and forth, make sure that you're keeping
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:59.180]   those records, paying for those expenses out of your business bank account and then what
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:02.960]   you want to do is keep a diary of your actual activities.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:07.780]   Without going into all the details of deducting business travel today, just keep a diary,
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:12.000]   make notes of where you're meeting, who you're meeting with, how long your trips are, etc.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.280]   so that you have that information so you can get the proper deductions that you're owed
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.000]   for those expenses.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.380]   But it sounds exciting to me.
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:28.200]   Deducting can be a great way to earn an income using a skill that you really have while giving
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.920]   you a good deal of flexibility.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.200]   Any other questions, Daria, before I go on to our last caller?
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   No, I just want to thank you wholeheartedly for what you do and thank you for the advice.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:42.520]   I'm so glad that it's been helpful to you and I'm so glad that you're here in the United
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:47.920]   States where you have more economic opportunity instead of in the USSR where you grew up.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.720]   So I'm really thrilled for you.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.380]   All right, I've got one last caller here with a Pittsburgh area code.
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.380]   Go ahead, please.
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.480]   I was calling just to listen mostly, actually.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.920]   I've talked to you before, Josh.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   You know my story.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:07.440]   I work with family business and just kind of learning from everyone, listening.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.560]   One thing out of curiosity, I'll just throw it out there as a conversation piece and see
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.080]   what your thoughts are.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:19.960]   I had a friend who is doing some flipping of real estate and kind of a similar situation
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:26.280]   to me, young family guy, couple kids, you know, money isn't flowing abundantly as always,
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:33.240]   but he ended up taking out a home equity line of credit to do his first flip and did very
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.160]   well on it and is now kind of taking what he made and continuing on, moving on to some
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.440]   bigger project than the original.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.600]   I wanted to see what your thoughts are on that as a strategy to kind of get into some
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.280]   real estate flipping and those sort of avenues of investing.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   Sure.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.680]   And just a comment for you and then any other patrons, there's no need, if you just want
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.840]   to listen in, don't ask a question.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.200]   There's no need for you to call into the conference call.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   Just listen on the show.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.200]   I don't edit the shows.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.580]   I just put them out as they are.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:06.280]   So you'll get the same thing on the show as you get on the live call and it helps me to
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.320]   make sure that I only have callers on the line.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.560]   Also in the future, just go ahead and listen in the podcast feed if you don't have a question
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.240]   for you and other members of the audience.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.000]   Also on your question, nothing wrong with it.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   It can work.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.840]   Basically, you're just trying to say, "I need capital," and if the capital is locked up
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.840]   in your house, you got to figure out some way to access the capital.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.240]   So sometimes that means you sell the house and you use that capital to go ahead and do
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   your deal.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.640]   Sometimes that means you borrow against it and you mortgage the property through a home
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.320]   equity line of credit.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.140]   So you need capital to do a business like flipping real estate.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:42.720]   Even if you're financing it, you're still going to need some capital to get good terms
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.480]   on your financing or to fund the project.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.720]   And so if the capital is locked up in your house, you can't access it.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.680]   The challenge is just simply to go slow and learn it.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.760]   The big mistake that we all make is trying to get too big for our britches too fast,
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.720]   where we have a little bit of success in one area and then all of a sudden you switch from
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.520]   a $100,000 project to a million dollar project.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:08.840]   But on your second project, you didn't figure out how to keep a contractor from doing something
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.160]   that caused you significant financial problem and now you're in a much deeper hole.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:19.680]   So it's a balance to say, "How aggressive do I be versus how careful do I be?"
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:25.480]   But many people have followed the path that your friend is following because when you
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:30.040]   decide to build a business, a lot of times it seems like the only money you have available
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.780]   is either in a 401(k) plan or in your house.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:36.560]   Those are the two places where most US Americans tend to accumulate their money.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:41.720]   So sometimes you cash out the 401(k) plan and sometimes you cash out the house and go
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.720]   from there.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.720]   Right.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:47.400]   And the 401(k), if you were to access that, obviously you just take a huge tax hit.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.840]   Is that kind of what happens?
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.800]   I know you can pull out Roth contributions without penalty as far as the amount you've
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.360]   put in, not the gains.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   But is that true?
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.080]   Is that how people would do that?
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.960]   Is just take a huge tax hit on whatever they have in there?
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.920]   For an operation like you're describing where somebody's investing in a real estate and
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:12.520]   they're not under any of the exceptions, for example, there are exceptions to 401(k)
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.480]   whether it's educational exception, first-time home buyer, significant medical expenses,
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   et cetera.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.600]   And if they don't have an exception where they can do it after 59 and a half, then yes,
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.600]   they're just going to pay taxes.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.200]   It's not necessarily a huge tax hit.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:34.880]   The way it works is you will pay a 10% penalty tax plus you will pay income taxes on the
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:35.880]   money.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:40.320]   And the reason that can be expensive is because the distribution that you're making from the
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:45.560]   401(k) comes generally all at one time.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:51.120]   And so when you get it, it might take you up into a higher marginal tax bracket.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.680]   And remember that all tax planning is done at the margin.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:58:01.600]   So if you are earning say $75,000 a year and you take out say $75,000 from your 401(k),
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.960]   now in this year instead of having a $75,000 income, you have $150,000 income and that
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.580]   can impact your bracket.
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.560]   So you're often paying taxes at a higher bracket.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.800]   But there are also ways of adjusting that.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.680]   For example, if you are working and earning but you're planning to take money out of the
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.640]   401(k) and flip a house, then just take it out in the following tax year and adjust it
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   so that you're doing it in a year where you're not working or where your income is down.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:31.800]   The end of the day, I encourage people don't get scared of penalties.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:36.880]   Just simply calculate them because it's possible, for example, in the scenario I just described,
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:44.240]   it's possible that I might be paying taxes at an effective tax rate of 20% right now.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.520]   But next year, I'm going to take money out of my 401(k) and I'm going to be flipping
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.920]   this house and my income tax rate is actually going to go down so low, let's just say I
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:58.600]   go down to 0% for the sake of my example, that paying a 10% penalty tax on the money
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:04.040]   is cheaper than it would be if I just left it there and pulled it out when I was retiring.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.620]   So you just look at the numbers.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.900]   You look at the rate of return that you're going to make with the prospective investment.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.160]   You calculate the cost of the capital.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.440]   And if you're going to take money out of a 401(k), you just got to sit down and calculate
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:20.400]   what is this costing me and make sure that there's enough margin and wiggle room in your
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.800]   decisions that you know you're going to be making money and with a comfortable margin
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.920]   of safety.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.560]   If it's compelling and it's financially compelling, personally I have no problem with
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:35.240]   pulling money out of retirement accounts in that situation if it's financially compelling.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.880]   If it's on the edge, then I would wait or I would look for another source of capital.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   Right.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   Great.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.520]   That helps a lot.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.520]   Thank you.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.520]   Awesome.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.640]   Well, thank you everybody for calling in to the show today.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.360]   I really appreciate it.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.560]   I enjoy doing these conference calls and I hope that you enjoy them as well.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.960]   If you listen to enough of them, you start to hear that there are some consistent themes.
[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.640]   I think it's so helpful to be able to learn from other people's stories and other people's
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.580]   actual challenges that they are facing.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.800]   From today's show, what I want you to take away from it.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.720]   Today's show, take away just the idea of training, setting a good example and giving positive,
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.920]   proactive training to your children and to other people for how they can make progress.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.960]   As Rocky said, building wealth is pretty simple.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.960]   Spend less than you earn and invest the difference.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.420]   Increase income when possible.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.600]   These are simple skills that people can learn.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.960]   They can learn at a very young age.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960]   They can practice.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   They can build.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.580]   They can develop these skills and abilities.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.960]   You and I can make a big difference in their lives by taking the time to sit down and teach
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.960]   them.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.200]   Sometimes you can teach them in public.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.640]   That's what I'm working on doing, obviously, is seeking to equip you with anything that
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.440]   I've learned and anything I can draw out of my guests.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.080]   You know what?
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.200]   I reach a lot more people, but a much lower percentage of people take action versus perhaps
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.760]   you might not be able to reach so many people, but a much higher percentage of the people
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.680]   that you reach might actually take action.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.360]   At the end of the day, knowledge that is not applied doesn't do anything.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.840]   Doesn't matter how much you know that I should make more, I should spend less, and I should
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.040]   invest the difference wisely.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.400]   Just knowing it doesn't make it happen.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.920]   Reach out today and help somebody.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.120]   Help somebody with some crisis budget counseling.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.760]   Help somebody with help a young person.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   Give them a job.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Give them an opportunity.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   Spend the time.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760]   Train them how to budget.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.960]   Train them about investing.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.680]   Look for ways where you can help and impact another person.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.520]   Let's get more people out of the bottom 80% and up into the top 20%.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.920]   Along the way, what'll happen is what happens in free market and has been happening for
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:40.240]   a couple hundred years, which is incredible, is the entire, I don't know how to get people,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.840]   how to change the 20/80 ratio, but we can get the entire thing to move up.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.280]   So even if the people in the bottom 80% are living far better than people in the top 20%
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.980]   were living in the past, because that's the circumstance that we're in today.
