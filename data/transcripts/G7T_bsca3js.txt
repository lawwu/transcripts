[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   We are coming off of our national conference dedicated to the life and legacy of C.S. Lewis,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.160]   who of course died 50 years ago this fall. When you think of celebrating a guy like Lewis,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720]   you must also be conscious of Lewis's failures and his weaknesses, which were also addressed
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.200]   at the conference. I mean, there was celebration and critique. Pastor John, how do you process
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.120]   this, especially the critique? How did you think through the critique of Lewis throughout the
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.200]   conference? One of the big recurrent questions at the conference, sometimes behind the scenes,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.040]   sometimes on the panel, was why can we benefit, why do I benefit from Lewis so much when he is
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.080]   so defective in some important doctrines? And he never saw himself as an advocate for any tribe,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:58.640]   like my little Reformed tribe. He wouldn't have thought of himself that way. And so we had to
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.960]   try to answer the question, what is it about Lewis that is, say, different from people who share some
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.920]   of his defective views whom we wouldn't have at a conference, say, and yet here we're devoting a
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.720]   whole conference to Lewis. It seemed like a contradiction to some folks. And here are some
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.280]   of the thoughts that I've had that came out of some of those conversations about what is it about
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.960]   Lewis. And to be honest, number one, it's probably that he's dead. I don't want to pass over that and
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.760]   ignore it. I'm sure that has an effect. I'm not sure what we would do with Lewis as the living
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.320]   dinosaur, which he called himself. But I think the fact that he's dead is the least significant
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.080]   in answering this question, though I don't want to minimize it. His deposit is made. He's not
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.400]   changing anything. He's there in his books. You can kind of deal with him at a distance. You don't
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.640]   have to deal with a real person. So he's dead, and yet I don't think that's the main thing.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:05.920]   Here are the other thoughts. He was a convert from atheism to orthodoxy and was moving all his life
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.640]   into an increasingly robust Christianity. He was never moving away from it. Most of the people
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.160]   today who share some of his errors, say views of Scripture or whether people can be saved without
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.440]   knowing the gospel or Christ, most of those people have been fundamentalists or evangelicals,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.640]   and they're moving away. You can tell. Something's happened in their life to disillusion them
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.680]   with a person or with a relationship or with a church, and they're moving away. That's not a
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.040]   very safe or reliable guide. Lewis had a different instinct. His trajectory and his instincts were
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.880]   toward orthodoxy and toward Scripture, and he embraced what the church had always taught and
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:06.160]   wasn't becoming a disillusioned fundamentalist like so many of the, I think, wayward teachers
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.600]   today. Here's another one. He was orthodox on the core commitments of the deity of Christ
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   and the Trinity and the death of Christ as a substitute for sinners and the way of salvation
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:29.440]   by faith alone. Lewis did not crusade for Reformed soteriology, but Doug Wilson made a pretty strong
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.720]   case that he believed it and that the best—at least I took away from Doug's talk—that the best
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:46.000]   prima facie evidence is that he was a settled churchman in the Anglican communion, and the 39
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.440]   articles against which he never said a word are Reformed in their soteriology, and he was at home
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.520]   there. He was an honest, orthodox Anglican, and when he wrote about the faith of the Puritans
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.920]   in his Oxford History of English lit, it was with glowing admiration that they were rejected by the
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.520]   Roman church because they were simply too happy, and what made them so happy was, like Luther said,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.880]   they had walked through the gates into paradise when they discovered justification by faith alone.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.240]   So Lewis is very solid on the center of soteriology, I think, even though he didn't
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.920]   want to jump into anybody's camp. Another reason I think I'm helped by Lewis so and not threatened
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.440]   by him is that he was totally devoted to being rational. He believed in reason, in the law of
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.920]   non-contradiction, the importance of propositional truth and crystal clarity, and utterly honest,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.040]   being honest and forthright. Most of the people who I get frustrated with today who are moving
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.560]   away from orthodoxy are slippery. They debunk propositional truth. They almost mock it. They
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:15.680]   roll their eyes at it in a way that Lewis never, never did. They cannot hold a candle to Lewis's
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.160]   joy or his rationality, and so he was just utterly exemplary in this, and therefore I feel safe
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.960]   around Lewis. He's never spinning anything. He's never playing with words. He loves clarity because
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.920]   he was pure and honest in the way he communicated. And another one is that he really believed in
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.360]   heaven and hell and thought people were going there, and that the most sophisticated don at
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.400]   Oxford should try to rescue the perishing. I mean, I'll tell you, when I read his statements about
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:59.760]   bending every effort to save souls, he distances himself from a lot of disillusioned Christians
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.720]   today who are misleading people because they've lost their confidence in the power of the gospel
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.080]   to save souls. They don't even like to use that language anymore and see us as the main business
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.480]   of life. And maybe the last thing would be Lewis was seriously joyful, not glibly clever. I just
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.760]   get tired today of so many people trying to be clever. So many are disinterested in doctrine,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   moving away from truth, and doing so with a kind of cavalier cleverness and shrewdness,
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:40.160]   and Lewis had none of that. He was totally earnest and jovial all at the same time.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:49.680]   So those are a few of the things that make me feel like he's a remarkably helpful person in spite of
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:58.960]   his doctrinal wavering in certain areas. He doesn't seem to me to be subtly dangerous,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.800]   like some people are. What you see is what you get, and in all these ways, he's really helpful.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.240]   Yes, he is helpful indeed. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
