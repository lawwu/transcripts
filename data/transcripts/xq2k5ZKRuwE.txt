[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220]   Every quarter, I set three goals for myself.
[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.320]   I say, what are the three things this quarter I want to do?
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.280]   Typically it's one relational goal.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.080]   Usually it's a fitness goal and usually it's a business goal.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.500]   For example, this quarter, one of my goals was simply to close the six
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.400]   apartment complexes we had under contract.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.700]   By the end of the quarter, I wanted to be able to close those.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.780]   And there's a lot of things that go into that, but that's the idea.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.600]   So I have the goal for the quarter every single Sunday night.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.300]   And again, if I miss it, I'll do Monday morning.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.900]   I sit down and I rewrite what those three goals are.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.080]   I write, what is the purpose for the goal?
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.780]   I write that every week.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.920]   Why do I want that goal?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680]   It just reminds me, it gets me back into the right mentality of like,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.780]   what am I doing all this for?
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.320]   Then I write down, what is my weekly goal?
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.520]   Like to be on track for my quarterly goal, what's the weekly goal?
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.720]   So I write the weekly goal down.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.760]   Then I always write, what's my most important next step?
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.040]   Like the smallest tangible thing I can do to accomplish my weekly goal.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.400]   So every morning of the week, I just wake up and I say, what is my most
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.600]   important step to accomplish the weekly goal every day.
