[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   So many of our emails are asking about how to
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   overcome the fears of life and how to overcome personal
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   insecurities as well. We all want to live with a fearless
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   confidence in God and for many of us that fearless confidence
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   is hard to find. On this theme, I
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   found the following sermon clip from Pastor John back in 1983
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   looking at the ministry of the Apostle Peter and his fears and his
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   insecurities as they are recorded in scripture.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   The Apostle Peter was Jewish of course and Christ changed his life.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Peter experienced a radical transformation in his thinking about God's plan.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   He came to discover that the Messiah had not just come for Israel
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   but for all the peoples, all the nations.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   That's basically the point of his vision in which a tablecloth full of unclean
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   animals descends from the heavens in Acts
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   chapter 10. The gospel was for the Gentiles
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   too. That was the point of the vision. So Peter should have known better
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   than to fall into a fearful insecurity when he met others
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   who contradicted this point. Galatians 2.12
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   explains what happened in his life where we read this, that "for before
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   certain men came from James, he, Peter,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   was eating with the Gentiles, the non-Jews.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But when they came, he drew back and separated himself
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   fearing the circumcision party, the Jews."
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   That's Galatians 2.12. It's this context
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   that sets the stage for an important life lesson about overcoming
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   fear and insecurities. Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   In other words, God has shown me that
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   redemptive history teaches that
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   there are no preconditions for the receiving of the Holy Spirit
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   but one, hearing the gospel with
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   faith. Isn't that what Paul said in
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Galatians 3.2 when he said
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   "Did you receive the Holy Spirit by works of the law
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   or by hearing with faith?"
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That's the gospel. That's the good news. And that
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   means that when Peter in Antioch was eating with
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Gentiles in all freedom, he was walking in
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   sync with the gospel. And Paul was happy.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   "Way to go, Peter! You've come a long way, brother!"
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Then something happened.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Even though he was honoring the all-sufficiency of Christ,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   walking in love, trusting the Lord, free!
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Here come the men from James.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now, we can only
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   speculate as to what was their relationship to James.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Was James endorsing what they were going to say? Or we don't even know
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   what they were going to say for sure. We don't know
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   why they came. But one thing is made very explicit.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Peter was afraid of them. Why?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Maybe they were capable of violence.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   He had really offended the conservative party
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   in Jerusalem. Maybe it was simply that
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   he would be called upon to give a theological justification of how he could
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   neglect Leviticus 11, it's the word of God!
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And he would come off poorly before the Christians in Antioch, and he doesn't
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   want to. Or maybe, and this seems to me maybe more likely,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   if he gets in bad
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   with the conservatives in Jerusalem, he's going to lose
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   his status and his respect as the leader in that church, which he still
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   possessed. And in fact, that happened, because James, by the end of the book of Acts,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   is the leader of the church in Jerusalem.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   We're not told. But he was afraid, and in a
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   moment of weakness, he cut himself off
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   from those Gentile believers. This is a
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   great lesson in leadership here. You see what happens when a leader
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   goes wrong? Everybody went wrong!
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   The whole Jewish contingent in the church
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   fell into line with Peter, and Barnabas, son of
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   encouragement, lover of Paul, on his first missionary journey
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   among the Gentiles. The pressure was so strong!
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   He went with them, left all
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   the Gentiles alone. Now put yourself in the position of a
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Gentile believer in Antioch. What would that have meant to you?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   According to verse 14,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Paul says that Peter and Barnabas and the others
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   are, to use the words of the RSV, not
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   walking straightforward about the truth of the gospel.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   A better way of saying it may be, they're not walking
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   right with the truth of the gospel. They are out of sync
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   with the gospel. Now, do you see what that means?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That means that it is true
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   the benefits of the gospel come on one condition alone,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   hearing it with faith. But when the gospel
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   comes, it changes your life
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   so that there is a life in sync with the gospel
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and there is a life out of sync with the gospel. That's
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   why Paul, even though he was standing up for the complete freedom
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   in grace of the gospel, could say, "You're out of line.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You're out of sync with the gospel.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   You don't attain the benefits of the gospel by doing a little moral
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   cleanup job on your life. You obtain it
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   forgiveness, cleansing, joy, peace, power.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   You obtain all that by faith in the gospel.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   But when the gospel so grips you, when you
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   begin to hear and believe the drumbeat
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   of the gospel, the rhythm of your steps
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   changes. And so Paul took Peter to task
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and we need to see three things
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   that were out of sync with the gospel here in closing.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I was teaching a Bible study on this text to a group of
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   men yesterday and I asked them, "What are the three things
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   out of sync with the gospel here?" And they nailed every one of them right on the head.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Number one, fear. Number
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   two, hypocrisy. And number three,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   legalism. And let's look at those together
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   because we don't want to be out of sync with the gospel when we leave this
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   church, do we? Fear is out of
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   step with the gospel. The gospel does not beget fear.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:7, "God did not give us
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   a spirit of fear, but of power,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   love, self-control." If you
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   come this morning, and I'm sure in a crowd like this there are many,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   you come this morning afraid. Maybe of
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   something very specific that's on the way. Or maybe,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   like sometimes happens to me, just a cloud of anxiety. You can't put your finger
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   on what in the world it is. You just feel tense and anxious
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and something's going to go bad today. And if you
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   come like that this morning, you know what you need more than anything in the world?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   You need to see the gospel.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You need to see that the gospel
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   says something about God's intentions towards
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   you this week. When you look at the death of Jesus on the cross
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   for your sins, you know what that says about God's intentions for you?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It says, "I am for you
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and not against you with all my might this week."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Paul put it like this, "What then shall we say to this?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   If God is for us, who can be against us? If He did not
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   spare His only Son, but gave Him up for us all, will He not with
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Him give us all things? Who shall bring any charge
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Who is to condemn? It was Christ Jesus who died,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   yes, was raised, is at the right hand of God, and intercedes
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   for us." If you see the gospel
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and believe the gospel, you know what your heart cries out?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   "The Lord is my helper. I will
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   not fear. What can man do to me?"
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So I hope that if you are burned with fear this morning, you just,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   the Lord will grant the eyes of your hearts
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   to be open to see the gospel. Second,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   hypocrisy is out of step with the gospel. Verse 13
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   says, "The rest of the Jews
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   acted insincerely." Literally, the word is hypocritically.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   "So that even Barnabas was carried away by their
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   hypocrisy." Peter and Barnabas and the Jews
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   were being two-faced. They were saying
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   on the one hand,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   "In my heart, I really believe that I am free to
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   live like the Gentiles and not keep the ceremonial
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   dietary laws anymore. But with my behavior, I will
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   say to avoid the censure of the
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Judaizers, 'Oh, I'm really living like a Jew up here in Antioch.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I'm keeping the law.'" Why were they
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   doing that? Because they were so incredibly fearful
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   of the persecution or criticism or censure or
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   something they were going to get from these people.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Isn't it true? Test your own experience and what you've seen in others.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Isn't it true that all hypocrisy is rooted
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   in fear or insecurity?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And that's out of step with the gospel. Insecurity
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   is inconsistent with the gospel. And I could just,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I don't know how many in this room would be insecure this morning, just
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   really insecure. No root
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   in stability and firmness and strength in your life so that you
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   have confidence and boldness as you walk through your days
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   in God. And you know the battle that you are
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   fighting when some people
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   or circumstances approach you, they demand
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   if you have integrity, that you stand up for your
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   principles, but instead of standing up for your principles, you put up
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   a front, you commit hypocrisy to avoid their
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   censure. You know what battle you're fighting at that moment?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   A battle to believe the gospel.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Some of us sort of divide our lives up and we say,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   "Well, the gospel was what I had dealings with when I was a little child and
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   walked the aisle or when I was humbled by the Lord and converted.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And now my battles are something else." That's not true.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It's all in the gospel. And every
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   day the walk of faith is a
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   battle to believe the gospel, that God is
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   for you and not against you, as was declared in Jesus
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Christ when he died on the cross.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And there's a second way, besides that great statement of God being
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   for us, that the gospel helps me avoid hypocrisy.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I picture Jesus in the gospel
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   facing the cross,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   a worse threat than I've ever faced or
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   ever will face, having the option to play the
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   hypocrite. He could have denied before
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Caiaphas that he was the Son of God and saved his skin
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   like Peter and the Jews denied their principles
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and saved their noses. And he didn't for
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   me and you. He laid himself down
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   on that cross without playing the hypocrite that I
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   might have life. And here
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   comes a temptation for me to play the hypocrite and avoid some little
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   criticism or persecution. And shall I not
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   be shamed by the cross, the gospel,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   if I play that game?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Center your life on Jesus Christ and his gospel and the root
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   of hypocrisy will be severed. Yeah, the gospel severing power
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   to kill the fear and insecurities of our lives. There's some
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   potent truth here in this clip taken from John Piper's sermon titled
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   "With the Gospel" preached on February 27th, 1983.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It can be found online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   If you have a sermon clip for me, email me your name, hometown, the sermon title, and the
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio. Tell me what stands out to you and put the word "clip"
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   in the subject line of an email and send it to me at
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. That's our email address.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. Well, it's interesting that the only time
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Galatians 2.12 has ever been mentioned on this podcast
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   until today was in an episode on Christian rap
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   of all topics. The episode is titled "Must Christian Rap
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Have the Gospel in Every Song?"
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That was APJ 188 on what it means for Christian music to be
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   in step with the gospel. Really good episode, episode APJ
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   188. And speaking of being out of step with the gospel,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   fear is a big deal. We saw that today when we saw that God gave us a
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   spirit not of fear, but of power and love
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and self-control. That again is 2 Timothy 1.7.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   We should know that text really well, but knowing that text
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   really well doesn't make the fear go away. That's the dilemma a
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   fearing Christian named Eric is now facing in his life.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   We address his ongoing struggle with fear next time. I'm your host Tony Rehnke, and we're rejoined
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   in studio with Pastor John on Friday. We'll see you then.
