[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.300]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.100]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.380]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.880]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.440]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.240]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.120]   Today on the show, we continue our series
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.820]   on how to set financial goals.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.660]   I introduced this series yesterday,
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.760]   gave you some fairly big picture ideas,
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.560]   encouraged you to dream, not to be scared of dreaming,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.760]   no matter what, to pay attention to your goals,
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.540]   your dreams, so that you can get more clarity
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.080]   on the things that are actually important to you,
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.500]   talk to you about how important it is
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.800]   that you follow your goals,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.440]   'cause you don't have to pay the price in advance,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.580]   and I ended with a point where I said
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.040]   that the clearer the goal, the easier the plan.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   And today I wanna home in a little bit more
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.320]   on the importance of clear goals,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.120]   especially as it relates to finances,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.220]   because the process of setting financial goals
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.520]   is in some ways similar to other goals,
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.100]   but in other ways, it's very different.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.340]   And the reason is, money doesn't actually matter.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.400]   What matters is what the money is used for.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.260]   And frequently I find that people have financial goals
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.780]   that they have simply not considered.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.540]   They've set a goal, but they haven't considered
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.520]   why they actually need a certain goal.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   If you were to go way, way back in the archives
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.100]   of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.700]   back to Tuesday, August 26, 2014,
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.200]   and listen to episode 48 of the show,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.460]   you would be listening to a podcast titled
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.460]   "Why You Should Probably Lower Your Financial Goals."
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.100]   It was one of the more popular episodes
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.780]   of Radical Personal Finance at the time,
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.060]   and one of those episodes that I received
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.080]   a lot of feedback from listeners on,
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.980]   who shared with me how impactful it was on them.
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.660]   And in that episode, I talked about
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.780]   why so many people set big financial goals
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.100]   without actually stopping and figuring out
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.380]   what those goals would mean, what they would represent.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.940]   The examples I use, people said,
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.740]   "I wanna save $5 million."
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.300]   And they don't actually know what $5 million means.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   They just simply know that it sounds nice,
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.260]   it's a nice round number.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.740]   And I talked about how important it might be
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.420]   for some people to lower their financial goals.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.780]   Because the higher you set your financial goals,
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.440]   the bigger the price tag of those goals.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.780]   If you set a target net worth number of $5 million,
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.580]   "My goal is to save and accumulate $5 million,"
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.380]   there's going to be a significant price to pay for that,
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.020]   and that price might be too high for you.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.620]   Additionally, when you set very high goals,
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.540]   you may need to, in order to accomplish those goals,
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.700]   develop very aggressive plans,
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.580]   and those aggressive plans can wind up costing you.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.080]   The higher your goals, the more risk you're gonna need
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.140]   to take on with your plan,
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.600]   and it may be that taking on additional risk
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.100]   is unwise.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.100]   And so I talked about the importance
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.540]   of actually charting out your goals.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.340]   Well, today's show is different on that theme,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.020]   but I encourage you, go back and listen to this.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.420]   Episode 48, what I'm talking about is not new.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.060]   I've been talking about this ever since I started the show.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.260]   2014, at this point, was when that episode came out.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.000]   But financial goals are different
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.580]   because money doesn't actually matter.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.700]   It's what the money can do for you.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.300]   Money has no value.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.400]   And so thus, setting financial goals
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.500]   is kind of stupid.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.300]   Who cares if you pile up stacks of cash?
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.720]   Who cares about those digits on the computer?
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   You don't actually care about those digits on the computer.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.420]   You don't care about those little pieces of paper,
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.180]   except to the extent that you care about
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.580]   what those pieces of paper can buy.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.660]   You know, I keep a collection.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.160]   I did a show on how the Venezuelan crisis
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.840]   that I've done quite a bit of work in over the last year
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.080]   and has affected me.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.920]   I keep a stack of Venezuelan currency.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.540]   My kids play with Venezuelan currency.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.860]   Church meeting on Sunday,
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.960]   my son's got a big wad of money in his pocket.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.800]   I had to lean over and ask him,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   "Is that Venezuelan money in your pocket or local money?"
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.640]   And he said, "It's from Venezuela."
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's just totally worthless.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.120]   The kids play with it, they crumple it up.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.760]   And it's so kind of weird for me to see
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   just money floating around,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.400]   but yet it drives home the point
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.240]   of how worthless currency is
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.520]   if it loses its value as a means of exchange.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.540]   You know, we all know that with paper currency.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.280]   The only value that paper currency has
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.440]   is simply if people are willing to accept it
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.120]   in exchange for goods and services.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.920]   The value is all entirely subjective.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.680]   It's in your head.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.980]   That's why the Venezuelan money is worthless
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.120]   and the Euro is not.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.940]   If you saw a pile of, you know,
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.960]   I didn't even bother to stoop down
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.680]   to pick up the money floating around my floor
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.560]   'cause I knew it was worthless Venezuelan money,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.120]   but you can bet your Euro
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.280]   that if I would look down and saw a stack of Euros
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.720]   just fluttering around down there,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.000]   I would be scooping those things up.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.320]   So the money itself doesn't matter.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.240]   And so when you set financial goals,
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.840]   if you're actually gonna achieve something,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.320]   the only way to put power behind your financial goals
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.040]   is to know what that goal represents.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.100]   And as with any goal,
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.380]   if you can know what a goal represents to you,
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.940]   you know your why.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.620]   And if your why is powerful enough,
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.180]   it'll pull you through to the goal achievement.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.820]   Best example I've ever heard of this comes from years ago.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.260]   I mean, years ago,
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.660]   I taught Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.900]   And at the time, I don't know if he still does it,
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.180]   he used the example of paying off debt.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.240]   So he used the example of paying off debt or saving money.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.440]   And he was talking about the importance of why
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.400]   on your financial goals.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.840]   And the question that he asked,
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.720]   and this is so deeply powerful to me,
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.740]   I've asked it to hundreds and hundreds of people.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.000]   But the question that he would ask to people
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.840]   is he would say,
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.440]   could you say people who are broke, in debt, no money,
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.080]   and say, could you save 10,000 bucks this year?
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.760]   People say, no, I can't save $10,000, I'm broke,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.540]   I'm a dad, don't make much money, I can't save $10,000.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.280]   And you say, well, tell you what,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.620]   what if your son was diagnosed with a serious illness?
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.160]   And that serious illness was guaranteed to kill him
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.500]   one year from today.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.620]   But the amazing thing is that there's actually
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.880]   a miracle cure that is available for this illness.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   There's an injection that you can buy.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.760]   And if he receives this injection,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.480]   he'll be saved from this illness no matter what, guaranteed.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.360]   Problem is this injection costs $10,000
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.640]   for a single injection.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.800]   And the company that makes it
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.360]   doesn't accept health insurance,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.800]   they don't give loans,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.840]   you gotta make sure that you actually pay for this thing.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   So the question is, could you in the next year,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   save $10,000 in order to buy this life-saving medicine
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.560]   for your son?
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   And of course, when you frame the situation like that,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.240]   every single time, you're gonna say yes.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.120]   And we could make it any price tag,
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.600]   we could make it $10,000, we could make it $100,000,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.360]   we could make it a million dollars.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.760]   Getting to the million dollar realm,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.720]   it's harder for some people to save that money,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.480]   but they could steal it, they could borrow it,
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.560]   they could fundraise it,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.760]   they could come up with the money some way.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.400]   But when the why is powerful enough
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.720]   and there's enough emotional energy,
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.240]   then the how quickly presents itself.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.080]   And in fact, you don't even have to solve the how.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.040]   If I gave you that as an intellectual exercise,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.280]   I said, how would you come up with an extra $10,000 this year
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.640]   to save life of your son?
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.840]   You'd have dozens of plans and you'd have backup plans
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   in case the first few dozen plans didn't work
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.320]   because it's that important.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.240]   And so that's the key with setting financial goals
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   is you have to understand the why.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.640]   If there's a big enough why behind a goal,
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.560]   you'll make it happen, you'll figure it out.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.200]   But financial goals in and of themselves
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.800]   don't have any emotion, they don't have any why,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.200]   which is why they're often not reached.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.680]   I'd like to save $1,000 this month, why?
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.360]   I don't know, sounds good, I know I kind of feel guilty
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.680]   'cause all these crazy personal finance podcast people say,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.760]   gotta save money.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.360]   Well, if you don't actually care about saving money,
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.520]   you're not gonna do it.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.720]   Why is it that the average American,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.240]   that half the American population
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.840]   can't put their hands on $1,000 cash?
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.940]   Why?
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.440]   It's not 'cause they don't have the money,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.800]   it's 'cause they don't care.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.760]   It's 'cause it's not important to them.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.240]   Nobody has either ever made the image
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.920]   of what it means to have $1,000 saved
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.000]   so attractive to them that they really want it
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.080]   and build up that desire as to what it would mean for them,
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.960]   or no one has ever ramped up the pain sufficiently
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.120]   to the point where they feel like they need to bother.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.640]   So they don't bother.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.800]   (silence)
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.040]   And as the numbers get bigger and the goals get different,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.920]   the concept stays exactly the same.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:15.640]   So accumulating money for its own purposes is dumb.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.260]   There's no point to it, there's no benefit to it.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.920]   If you're a miser and you're a miser
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   who has 20 gold coins buried in mason jars around your house
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.840]   versus a miser who has 40 gold coins
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.160]   buried in mason jars around your house,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.620]   nothing about your life changes.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.740]   You just have double the amount of gold coins.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.200]   The gold's gonna sit in the ground,
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.040]   the jars are gonna get rusty and it's just gonna sit there.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.480]   Doesn't do anything for you.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.280]   Money that's still, that's static, no matter the form.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.000]   Gold coins in your backyard, pieces of paper in your wallet,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.980]   digits on your computer, tracking software.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.280]   Unless the money has a job, unless the money has a meaning,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.400]   unless the money has an impact, it's pointless.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.040]   So when you're setting financial goals,
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.320]   the magic secret to setting good ones
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.760]   is to focus on the why.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.020]   What does this mean?
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.540]   Now in coaching, when you study how to be a good coach,
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.580]   one of the things you learn is to help people dig into why.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.100]   Why do you want this?
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.500]   And it can kind of be a fun game
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.940]   that my two-year-old plays with me constantly.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.420]   Why, Daddy, why, why?
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.460]   We can go eight questions deep.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.940]   But somehow we, most of us adults
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.660]   have lost that two-year-old why question.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.020]   But yet it's really useful.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:54.220]   I'd like to earn $100,000 this year.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.060]   Why?
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:01.060]   Well, 'cause it sounds good, not gonna be very powerful.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.820]   Or because it'll allow me to start a business
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.940]   that I wanna do.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.300]   Why, why do you wanna start a business?
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.500]   Because it'll give me freedom and control over my day.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.360]   And if I wanna sit at home and eat pancakes
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.500]   with my family in the morning,
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.560]   instead of rushing off to the office
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.200]   to be there at the crack of seven, I can do that.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.860]   We can follow the train on.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.940]   Why is this important?
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.900]   Why is this important?
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.740]   Why do you care?
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.560]   Why do you want this?
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.760]   Why do you wanna do that?
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.780]   Money goals should always be articulated
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.340]   in terms of what they mean for you,
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.420]   what they will allow you to accomplish.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.820]   If I earn this certain amount of income,
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.700]   then I'll be able to accomplish this.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.420]   Or if I earn this certain amount of income,
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.300]   it will represent that I have accomplished this.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.340]   If I save this amount of money, it will represent this.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.440]   Here's why that's important to me.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.300]   Here's why I care about that.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.100]   Here's why I'm pursuing this goal.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.780]   If you don't know the why behind your financial goals,
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.700]   you won't make progress.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.100]   But if you know the why,
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.960]   you might make progress very quickly.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.580]   As we pivot to part two,
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.360]   because when you know the why,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.040]   the how might change.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.020]   When you are clear enough on your why,
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.920]   the how might change.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.540]   One of my goals in speaking to you
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.780]   has been to talk about the why enough
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.060]   so that you can see how the how changes.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.620]   I was so gratified to see a comment from a listener
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.300]   I was talking about the FIRE movement.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.300]   And I shared the comment on social media.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.380]   I said, "If you hate your job, FIRE is not the solution.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.700]   You're just gonna hate your job for longer
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.740]   while you live on nothing,
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.060]   meanwhile just hating everything.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.280]   So now you're not gonna have any fun
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.380]   of spending money on anything
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.520]   'cause you just gotta quit, gotta save money and quit
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.620]   while you hate your job.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.780]   The simpler solution is go find a better job
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.020]   and then go ahead and save money towards early retirement."
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.700]   For me, it's one of my, I guess,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.460]   one of my cards that I wanna,
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.300]   drums that I'm gonna beat
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.280]   in this world of the FIRE movement,
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.380]   the current iteration of the financial independence movement.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.420]   Because as I see it, it's far more efficient
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.420]   instead of worrying about saving hundreds of thousands
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.380]   or millions of dollars,
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.740]   it's far more efficient to build a life
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.500]   that you're not desperate to retire from.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.980]   And I was so gratified to see a comment on social media
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.820]   from someone who said that my question of,
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.180]   "What would you do if you knew you could never retire?"
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.020]   was life-changing for a listener who shared that with me.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.420]   And I love that because to me, that's the key.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.320]   What would you do if you knew you could never retire?
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.280]   Start there.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.380]   Because that how is a lot simpler.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.700]   I'll use my own story.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.420]   Back when I was a financial advisor,
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.900]   I couldn't do this podcast
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.040]   because of the fact that I was a financial advisor.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.260]   And you gotta deal with the teams of lawyers and the SEC
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.060]   and your marketing speak and FINRA and blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.260]   So I couldn't do my podcast.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.700]   Now, I had a choice to make.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.220]   I said, "Well, I could either save a whole bunch of money,
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220]   "make a lot of money,
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.420]   "do this business the way that I'm doing it,
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.020]   "and save a bunch of money,
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.420]   "become financially independent, and then quit.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.860]   "Or I could pursue a different plan."
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.340]   And when I laid out the different plan,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.300]   I decided that it was far more efficient for me
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.540]   to just quit without having all the millions of dollars
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.180]   saved and go and build a new business
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.980]   than it was for me to spend years working on something
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.060]   that I didn't really care all that much about.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.900]   'Cause I didn't really care
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.940]   about having millions of dollars in the bank,
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.060]   except for what the millions of dollars
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.420]   in the bank would represent, which was freedom.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:21.180]   But you can either achieve freedom with a high net worth
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.380]   or with an ongoing income,
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.720]   and you can just simply create the income
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.080]   by building a business.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.540]   And the only downside that I could come up with
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.980]   to doing what I've done was the fact
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.380]   that I'll never be able to say
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.740]   that I didn't build my wealth
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.900]   from teaching people how to build wealth,
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.360]   which is one of those things
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.600]   where it's not scamming necessarily,
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.540]   but it's always like, "Eh, I kinda wish I was rich before."
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.540]   But why waste years and years just for that?
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.500]   So if you desire freedom, go and build freedom
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.560]   with some other plan that doesn't require years and years
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.420]   and years of savings.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.780]   The how for me to achieve, to do what I wanted to do
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.980]   to fulfill my goals became simpler
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.860]   once I realized why I was pursuing a plan.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.940]   And there's so many examples that we could use.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.740]   Once you're clear enough on what you want the money for,
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.300]   you might start to get creative
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.700]   with all kinds of ways that you can accomplish it.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.780]   Let's use some smaller examples
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.320]   other than just not ultimate financial independence.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.780]   Let's say you set a goal of saving an emergency fund.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.740]   It's a reasonable goal.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.580]   It's a good goal.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.640]   I think you should do it.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.900]   Let's say you say, "I wanna save
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.420]   "three months worth of expenses, 10,000 bucks, right?
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.940]   "I wanna save $10,000 of an emergency fund."
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.100]   Why do I wanna save $10,000 of emergency fund?
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.100]   Well, I wanna have a plan in case I get sick
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.560]   or hurt, can't work.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.860]   I wanna have a plan in case I lose my job.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.340]   What's your current savings rate?
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.300]   I save 500, that could save $300 a month.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.900]   Well, if your goal is to save $10,000
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.120]   and you're saving $300 a month,
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.360]   if my podcast math is anywhere correct,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.480]   you're looking at almost three years of savings
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.120]   to reach that goal, 33 months.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.160]   It's a long time.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.820]   So when you break it down, you say,
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.440]   "Why do I want this emergency fund?
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.960]   "What does this represent?"
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.220]   You may be able to get there far faster
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.460]   through some alternative approaches.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.560]   Maybe you could minimize the need for higher expenses
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.260]   by clearing some debt.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.520]   That's kind of obvious, but I talk about, for example,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.340]   the value of buying the thing that the money would buy,
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.420]   maybe storing some food and water.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.180]   If you have three months of food stored in your house
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.400]   that you could live on an emergency,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.880]   then you can very reliably lower the target amount of money
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.300]   that you need to save by the amount of food
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.740]   that you have saved.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.500]   And you might be able to save that food from other means
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   other than just in the financial system.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   There may be various ways you could plan and say,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.140]   "Well, I would cut these subscriptions,"
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.340]   so you can minimize your need for savings there.
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.120]   The point is simply that there's more than one way
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.100]   to be prepared for an emergency
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.060]   that's not just an emergency fund.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.160]   Or maybe you set a goal of buying a new car.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.720]   That's your financial goal.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.360]   Well, what do you want the car for?
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.000]   What do you want it to represent?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.860]   A lot of people buy cars just 'cause they're bored.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:43.120]   So if you say, "I wanna buy a new car 'cause I'm bored
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.140]   "and I feel like it'll add a little spice to my life,
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.780]   "are there other ways that I can solve my need
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.360]   "for alleviating boredom?"
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.400]   Maybe instead of buying a new car,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.020]   we'll take that money and we'll move to Ho Chi Minh City
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.900]   and enjoy Ho Chi Minh City
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.660]   and enjoy using all of the transportation options
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.500]   that are there and alleviate our boredom
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.140]   in a more efficient way,
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.100]   or perhaps a more pleasurable way, not saying it's cheaper.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.660]   And again, my big financial goal, I wanna retire.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.500]   Why?
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.820]   Well, because I hate my job.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.180]   Isn't it better to just substitute a career
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.640]   that you don't hate, change your job out?
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.200]   Because once you do that,
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.580]   all of the financial numbers can change.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.220]   Yesterday I was doing coaching calls.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.700]   I have a handful of private clients
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.940]   that I work with on an ongoing basis.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.240]   They're all entrepreneurs.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.180]   So I do coaching calls on Monday morning.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.340]   And I was working with clients
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.340]   and we were running the numbers on one guy's situation.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.660]   And this client is in a decision point
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.160]   because he's running a very big business.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.460]   It's extremely profitable,
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.460]   millions of dollars of income and value
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.840]   and extremely profitable.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.660]   But the question is, do I wanna get bigger?
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.780]   Doesn't need the money,
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.260]   already has more money and more income
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.100]   than he's ever gonna spend.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.260]   Frugal guy, doesn't need the money.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.860]   And so the question comes down to,
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.560]   should we keep building?
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.720]   Should I keep growing?
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.100]   I could pull back, put everything on to autopilot,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.460]   just coast, make the money, save the money.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.380]   He's never gonna spend the money.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.660]   The money is just gonna be given away
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.580]   when he's dead anyway.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.960]   So should you just coast and live the good life
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.360]   or should you keep building?
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.220]   Should you go to tens of millions
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.900]   and hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.420]   instead of just a few million?
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.120]   The only way to answer that question would be why?
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.880]   The money itself becomes immaterial
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.120]   and it becomes a matter of what the money represents.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:09.200]   And I find that really exciting
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.760]   because what money represents
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.360]   is some really exciting stuff.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.200]   For example, I've got really big,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.160]   I've got really big income goals personally.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.640]   I don't know how long it's gonna take me to hit them,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.080]   but I'm really committed to them
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.440]   because of what it represents.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.760]   First, of course, what I can do with the income
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.140]   and what that represents,
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.440]   but also what it represents for me,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.880]   for my personal development,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.200]   for my self-actualization,
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.920]   needn't abuse the hoity-toity term.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.760]   Right?
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.200]   For me to generate millions of dollars per year of income
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   requires me to affect hundreds of thousands of lives
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.760]   positively.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.200]   That's my goal.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.360]   And one of the ways that I can measure that
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.340]   is through income.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.240]   It's not the income that matters, it's just money.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.400]   I'm not gonna spend it.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.640]   I'll save it, I'll spend it, save it, whatever.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.340]   But the point is, it's just money.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.200]   But what the money represents is world change.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.040]   What the money represents is families changed,
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   which is one of my most important things.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.160]   And it's the same thing for you.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.760]   What the money might represent is you conquering
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.040]   your laziness.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.560]   What the money might represent is you conquering
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   the bad start you got in life.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.280]   What the money might represent is you conquering
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.200]   your self-discipline.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.700]   Might represent any number of things.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.580]   But once you understand what the money represents,
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.800]   then you have a goal that has power
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.200]   and it can pull you forward.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:11.760]   So let's close it out today with two words.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.760]   Why do you care about the goals that you're setting?
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.920]   And then how can you accomplish what you care about
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.360]   in a really effective way?
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.300]   Simple example.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.540]   And I use me because of course you're listening to me.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.300]   I feel bad always using myself, but I know myself better
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.400]   and I figure you know me pretty well,
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.160]   and so if I use examples that you know,
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.400]   you'll understand those examples better than me
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.800]   just using anonymous people all the time.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.680]   Thank you to so many of you who participated,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.440]   bought my courses, booked consulting with me,
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:01.360]   with the Black Friday, Cyber Monday,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.840]   big sales I've been running the last few days.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.280]   Thank you, thank you, it's been awesome.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.980]   Response is outstanding.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.220]   That money, that large influx of cash
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.540]   represents change.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:25.460]   It represents change that I can help people accomplish.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:32.200]   This is why, so my goal, one of the reasons why I do this
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.260]   is because I want to see societies transformed.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.860]   I wanna see families transformed,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.380]   I wanna see lives transformed,
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.460]   and I wanna see societies transformed.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.180]   I wanna see families stabilized,
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.100]   I wanna see people in stable situations
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.780]   so they can raise stable children
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.780]   so that our society grows and is better, et cetera.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.380]   That's one of my missions.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.420]   And I believe that when you make wise financial decisions,
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.580]   that can overflow into other areas of your life.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.340]   It has a ripple effect to other areas of your life.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.940]   And so there are many ways to do that.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.940]   But in order for me to grow my business, my impact,
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.780]   I have to invest in the tools and the people, et cetera,
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.100]   to grow that message.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.700]   And so the income is great.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.440]   It's been a very profitable weekend, which is awesome.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.700]   But what that profit represents is additional impact,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.260]   additional change, additional products,
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.540]   additional services, additional insight,
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.860]   additional message that reaches more people,
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.340]   and they'll have a ripple effect
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.260]   because every person that I affect reaches out
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.900]   and that ripple effect goes on.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.340]   We're all people pebbles tossed into a pool.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.180]   So every ripple I create in turn will ripple you.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.420]   So in unison we ripple, a type of ripple rhythm,
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.780]   but we need to ripple in a way that benefits our living.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.340]   And so the money funds that expansion of the ripples.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.480]   That's why I care so much.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.840]   This year, this coming year for me, 2020, I am dedicated.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.240]   You are gonna hear me sell so much stuff to you
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.880]   in the next month and this year, again and again and again.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.360]   Because the conclusion I came to was I will fail
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.640]   at my goal of impacting more people
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.160]   if I cannot build the infrastructure needed to do that.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.280]   And because I've been so lazy about sales
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.840]   and so half-hearted about sales
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.340]   and I've tilted at all these windmills
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.000]   of wanting to do things without conflicts of interest
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.120]   and whatnot from all years in the financial advice business,
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.240]   I've wasted time.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.720]   So the money represents for me.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.040]   So whatever your financial goals, think about them,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.840]   write them down, clarify them,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.680]   and then ask yourself why, why do I want this?
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.400]   And then the how, lots of ways to do the how.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.320]   And there's lots of efficient ways to do the how.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   More examples in days to come.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.600]   Thank you for listening.

[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.440]   I hope I helped you with some ideas

[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.320]   to help you achieve your goals faster,
