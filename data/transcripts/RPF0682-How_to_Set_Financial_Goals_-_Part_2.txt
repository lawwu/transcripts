Let's say you say, I want to save three months worth of expenses, 10,000 bucks, right? I want to save $10,000 of an emergency fund. Why do I want to save $10,000 of emergency funds? Well, I want to have a plan in case I get sick or hurt, can't work. I want to have a plan in case I lose my job. What's your current savings rate?
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:18:59.820]   What's your current savings rate?
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:18:59.820]   What's your current savings rate?

[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   Maybe you could minimize the need for higher expenses by clearing some debt.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:47.340]   That's kind of obvious, but I talk about, for example, the value of buying the thing that the money would buy.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.560]   Maybe storing some food and water.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.080]   If you have three months of food stored in your house that you could live on an emergency,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.360]   then you can very reliably lower the target amount of money that you could live on an emergency.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:19:59.360]   Then you can very reliably lower the target amount of money that you could live on an emergency.

[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.120]   but I'm really committed to them because of what it represents.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.600]   First, of course, what I can do with the income
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.040]   and what that represents, but also what it represents
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.520]   for me, for my personal development, for my self-actualization,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.240]   to use the hoity-toity term.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.980]   Okay?
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.940]   For me to generate
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.720]   millions of dollars per year of income requires me
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   to affect my personal development.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   I'm not going to be able to do that.

[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:52.960]  hhhhh. What the runny represents is families changed. Just one of my most important things. And it's the same thing for you. What the money might represent is you conquering your laziness. What the money might represent is you conquering the bad start you got in life. What the money might represent is you conquering your self-discipline.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:52.960]   I'm going to leave that one for you.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:03.900]   when
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:21.720]   won play. It is, set,
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:52.380]  ued, and a really effective way. Simple example. And I use me because of course you're listening to me. I feel bad always using myself but I know myself better and I figure you know me pretty well and so if I use examples that you know you'll understand those examples better than me just using anonymous people all the time. Thank you to so many of you who participated.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:26:22.660]   Thank you. Thank you. It's been awesome. Responses outstanding.

And so there are many ways to do that. But in order for me to grow my business, my impact, I have to invest in the tools and the people, et cetera, to grow that message. And so the income is great.

[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   It's been a very profitable weekend, which is awesome. But what that profit represents is additional impact, additional change, additional products, additional services, additional insight, additional message that reaches more people. And it'll have a ripple effect because every person that I affect reaches out and that ripple effect goes on.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   We're all people pebbles tossed into a pool. So every ripple I create in turn will ripple you. And so the income is great.
