[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   If you look at the history of corporate fraud, you are not going to find
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   unintelligent people having been the masterminds behind this, you're going to
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.680]   find really, really, really smart, even brilliant people having been behind it.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.000]   Maybe some part of that is this linkage between the visionary and the fraudster
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.200]   that so many of these corporate frauds are people who have qualities of the
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.640]   visionary and to have the qualities of a visionary, you have to
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.240]   have pretty high intelligence.
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.720]   Um, and I do think so many of these stories are, are about then self-delusion.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.840]   So I don't think smart people are any less likely to suffer from
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.360]   self-delusion than dumb people.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.240]   And they're probably more likely to, because you can rationalize, you
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.420]   know, the smart person's ability to rationalize just about anything they
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.160]   want to rationalize is pretty profound.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.160]   Whereas perhaps someone who doesn't have quite the same, the same brain power
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.720]   isn't going to be able to create a narrative under which their actions are
