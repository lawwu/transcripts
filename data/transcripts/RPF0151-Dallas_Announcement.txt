[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.580]   Shop the early access Black Friday sales
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.300]   for the best deals of the season.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.840]   The all night shopping party starts
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.000]   Thanksgiving night at 8 p.m.

[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.260]   - Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.660]   for today, Wednesday, February 11, 2015.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.540]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.780]   Very quick show today,
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.580]   just a very short announcement for you.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.580]   I apologize, but I need to actually preempt today's show,
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.780]   which was planned to be part two
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.940]   of the master class on 529 plans.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.660]   Forgive me, but I've decided last minute
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.780]   to go ahead and fly out to Dallas, Texas tomorrow morning
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.780]   for the Technology Tools for Today conference.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.780]   So I will be out in Dallas on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.620]   returning home on Saturday evening.
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.060]   So if the reason I'm announcing on the show is A,
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.340]   there may not be a show while I am out there.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.140]   There may not, I will do my best to get some shows out
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.360]   while I'm out there, but no promises.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.940]   It'll depend on what the logistics wind up being.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.160]   I've got a few reasons why I need to be out there
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.020]   at this conference, and I'll share them with you
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.860]   on the show in the future.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.700]   So don't be worried if there's no shows
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.820]   the next couple of days.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.640]   But number two, if you are in Dallas and you are a listener,
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.300]   I would love to connect with you.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.180]   I would love to host a meetup of some kind,
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.700]   and so I will probably do that.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.700]   No details yet, but if you are a listener in Dallas,
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.480]   please reach out to me and let me know.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.060]   You may feel free to email me,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.680]   although the best way to coordinate this
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.380]   will probably be on Twitter.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.420]   So connect with me personally on Twitter @joshuasheats.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.940]   And I will be, this conference will be at the Hilton,
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.000]   what is this, the Hilton Anatoly, I guess,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.180]   in Dallas, Texas, in downtown Dallas.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.520]   And I'd love to connect with any of you
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.740]   who would like to meet up.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.300]   I'll figure out details, but keep an eye on Twitter.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.780]   Let me know that you're in town
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060]   or that you would like to connect,
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.620]   and we'll probably set something up
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.340]   once I know more details on my schedule.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.180]   And we'll keep an eye on Twitter for that.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.300]   That'll be the best way to connect.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.620]   So forgive me, no show in the next couple of days,
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.060]   but I will be back with you as soon as possible.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.060]   And again, if I can release some episodes while I'm there,
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.820]   I'll do that.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.460]   And this will be good for the show.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.920]   I plan to be doing a bunch of interviews
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.000]   while I'm out there, which I'll be able
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.320]   to bring you on the show.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   That's one reason among many why I've decided
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.160]   last minute to fly out there.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.840]   The rest of you, if you would like,
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.960]   by the way, it's not just for you who are in Dallas.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.640]   I invite you to connect on, if you're interested
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.320]   in seeing what's going on or interested in updates
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.680]   on what a financial advisor conference is like,
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.800]   connect on Twitter @joshuasheats.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.680]   So twitter.com/joshuasheats is where you can find
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.080]   my personal Twitter handle.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.400]   And also, just a quick note on that.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.900]   How I generally use social media,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   I use the @radicalpf handle.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.740]   That's just me.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.300]   There's no team of people.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.380]   That's always me on both of them at the moment.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.340]   But I use the @radicalpf handle for specifically show stuff
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.120]   and episode announcements and topics
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.260]   that are specific to financial planning.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.260]   And then @joshuasheats is my own personal Twitter handle,
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.620]   and I usually would just keep that.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.900]   I don't know, I do some financial stuff every now and then.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.920]   Sometimes I'll retweet something that I tweet for myself
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.960]   on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.120]   I make the little loop.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.280]   But I usually do keep those things separate.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.900]   So feel free to follow me on both.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.880]   If you're interested in the personal side of my life,
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.200]   @joshuasheats, I'd love to have you there.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.520]   And also, feel free to connect.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.000]   If you'd like to see pictures from the conference,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.680]   things like that, connect with me on Facebook,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.080]   my personal Facebook.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.840]   You can find that at facebook.com/joshuasheats.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.920]   And just, yeah, request a friend over there,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.480]   and I'd love to be friends with all of you on there.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.260]   If any of you would be interested.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.220]   Same thing on Facebook, I use the Facebook fan page
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.580]   for the show to do the show info.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.060]   And I don't know, I probably should be better
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.840]   at self-promotion, but I don't like to clutter up
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.680]   my own personal stuff with too much,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.860]   with too much show stuff.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.860]   I probably should do better every now and then I do,
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.700]   so I've been announcing the Patreon campaign there.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.020]   I should probably do more of that.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.300]   But feel free to connect with me on facebook.com/joshuasheats
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.140]   and then connect with the show,
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.660]   facebook.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.340]   And all that stuff, you can connect anywhere.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.620]   So if you are in Dallas, I would like to meet you,
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.140]   no matter who you are, I would love to connect with you,
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.240]   and we'll work out a time that would work.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.700]   So shoot a note to me on either Twitter
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.980]   or email me joshuatradicalpersonalfinance
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.300]   and we will connect.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.780]   And then also, thank you for those of you
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.940]   who have been supporting the Patreon page.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.460]   We are doing extremely well with that so far.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.460]   As I record this right now on February 11th at 8.43 p.m.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.060]   Eastern Standard Time, we have a current number
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.520]   of 26 patrons at $338 per month.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.140]   And I thank each and every one of you.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.860]   And I hope you don't mind, I don't wanna read through
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.460]   the whole list on the show.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.620]   I think that would be repetitive for many people.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.220]   But know that I read carefully your names
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.420]   and I thank you for your contributions.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.280]   I really do.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.440]   And I especially thank even those of you,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.820]   trust me, a dollar a month is meaningful.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.460]   If every member of this audience contributed $2 a month
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.740]   to the show, then we would be at the $6,000
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.140]   to keep the show ad-free forever.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.780]   If every member, just $2 a month to the show,
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.020]   we're at $6,000 and then we're done
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.060]   and I'll announce it every now and then.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.220]   But I won't kind of make this, do this public radio
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.980]   pledge drive thing that I seem to be doing right now.
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.640]   And if you are, forgive me, I'm working hard
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.100]   to kind of get those awards sent out
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.700]   and get everything processed and streamlined
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.540]   to connect on Facebook and give you,
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.060]   those of you who are at the irregulars level,
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.620]   give you access to the irregulars page
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.300]   where I've been spending a lot of time answering questions.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.620]   And so we're working those out.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.140]   I'll have those done to you in just as soon as I can.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.180]   So thank you to each and every one of you.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.700]   If you would like to contribute and you haven't yet,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.780]   what we're doing is we're running a crowdfunding campaign
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.300]   to try to keep the show ad-free.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.720]   I would love to do that for you all.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.300]   Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.900]   is where you can find all of those details.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.740]   And that's it, I gotta go and pack.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.620]   And I fly out at 5 a.m. tomorrow.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.780]   Love to see any of you who are in Dallas tomorrow
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.060]   or the next couple of days.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.180]   Reach out and let me know.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.220]   Cheers, y'all, have a great night.
