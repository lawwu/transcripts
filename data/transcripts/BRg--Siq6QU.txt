[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   The one core principle that I have held on to for as long as I can remember, maybe since
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.360]   middle school, is to never fail due to a lack of effort, because effort requires no skill.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.080]   And this is really, really an important principle, because life is not fair.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.520]   Some people have better advantages than you, wealthier parents.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.900]   Some people are stronger, naturally smarter.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.600]   Whatever the case may be, the playing field is never, ever, ever fair, and we have to
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.800]   accept that.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.740]   If we never fail due to a lack of effort, that means we are always going to try our
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.480]   best, and if we lose, it's not going to be because we didn't try our best.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.760]   It can be because the opponent was faster, quicker, smarter, whatever it is, more connected.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.540]   But if we do our best, we're always going to be satisfied, and we'll never look back
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.680]   with regret, having not tried our best.
