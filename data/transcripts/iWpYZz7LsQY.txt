[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   This evening to the second verse in the chapter which we read at the beginning, the second
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.640]   chapter in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:22.440]   2, verse 2. "For I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and Him
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:32.920]   crucified." We meet together on a Sunday evening like this in a world that is in great
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.400]   trouble, in great confusion. You can't hear a news bulletin, you can't read a paper without
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.960]   reading of some new catastrophe, some new tragedy, some new problem. The world is in
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:55.320]   a terrible plight. Everybody is agreed about that. But what everybody is not agreed about
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.640]   is as to the question of what exactly is the business or the duty, if you like, of the
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.600]   Christian church at such a time, and what is the duty of every individual Christian.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.440]   There is great confusion concerning this, concerning this question of what is exactly
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.120]   the task of the church. There is great discussion about this. People argue about this, even
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.040]   people who never attend a place of worship. They tend to ask the question at times, "What's
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.120]   the Christian church doing? How do you justify your carrying on and perpetuating and spending
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:47.440]   money on your buildings and your organizations? What is the business and the task of the church?"
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.760]   And in the same way, we can put the question by putting it like this, "What is the great
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.640]   message that the world needs at this moment?" It's having many messages spoken to it. This
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.120]   is the age of propaganda. Never have there been so many words addressed to individuals
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.360]   and to society and to the whole world. But what is the message that the world really
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.920]   needs at this present time? Or let's put it quite personally and individually, what
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:31.040]   do you need? What do I need? What is it that every individual in the world needs at this
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.840]   present moment? Now these are the questions you see that are raised by the great apostle
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.240]   in this particular chapter that we are looking at together, and especially in terms of this
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.220]   second verse. It's interesting to observe the way in which the apostle ever came to
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.160]   write these words. And indeed this chapter and the second half of the first chapter and
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.800]   the third and the fourth chapters, he wrote them because a situation had arisen in the
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.640]   church at Corinth which necessitated his writing in this way. It was Paul who first took the
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.440]   gospel to Corinth. It was under his ministry that a number of people had been converted,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.360]   and he'd formed them and established them into a church. And for a while it had been
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.520]   a very remarkable church, great in gifts and in many other respects. But by now there was
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.360]   great trouble in the church. It was a divided church, a confused church, a very unhappy
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:43.000]   church, guilty of what he later calls schism. And what had caused this was that people had
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.400]   become somewhat confused as to the nature of the gospel. This thing he refers to as
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.120]   wisdom of men, or the wisdom of the world, which we call philosophy. He has said in the
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.200]   seventeenth verse of the first chapter, "Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.480]   not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect." Well,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.120]   it was, you see, this very confusion in the church at Corinth that led the apostle to
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:29.000]   write in this manner and to remind these people of what the gospel really is, what the message
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.960]   of the gospel is, and in other words, what the function of the Christian church is as
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.920]   she stands face to face with a world that is in great trouble.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.000]   Now as I'm going to show you, the world was much the same then as it is now. And here
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.840]   we are told by this great preacher, this great apostle, the greatest evangelist and founder
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.360]   of churches that the world has ever known, we are told by no less an authority, what
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.960]   the answer is to these various questions. And I suggest to you that nothing is more
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.480]   urgent or more important for us, every one of us as individuals tonight, and especially
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.440]   those who are members of the church, that we may know exactly what the Christian message
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.200]   truly is. Now then, let's see what the apostle says.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.400]   Well, the first thing he tells us is, "I determined not to know anything among you,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:42.960]   save Jesus Christ and him crucified." He arrived at a decision. This was something
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   quite deliberate that he determined to do. Now there are those who would have us believe
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.680]   that the apostle arrived at this decision as the result of an experience he had had
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.160]   in the great city of Athens, which he had visited, as you will recall, from the history
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.680]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles before he went to Corinth. And in Athens, he had
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.960]   quoted some Greek poets. And so there are those who have said that the apostle, having
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.560]   quoted Greek poets in Athens, and having had his sermon interrupted, and having been more
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.280]   or less a failure in Athens, that on the way from Athens to Corinth he decided, "Well,
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.240]   I'm not going to do that again. I'm not going to display my knowledge of Greek poetry
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:47.400]   or anything else." But I feel that that's quite a false way of explaining these words.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.320]   It seems to me rather that the position is this. The apostle, he knew before he ever
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:01.280]   went to Athens, the attitude of the world to this gospel. He has said in the previous
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:12.400]   chapter that the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom. He always knew this.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.080]   He didn't have to learn that in Athens. He knew it from the beginning. But we preach
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:27.240]   Christ crucified, and to the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness. And
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:34.360]   what he's telling us here is this, that though he knew that the Jews stumbled at this
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:42.420]   message of his, and though the Greeks regarded it as utter folly and foolishness, something
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:52.860]   beneath contempt in their estimate, he nevertheless deliberately decided that he would preach
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.920]   this same message and nothing else. That's the meaning of this statement.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.600]   Now the apostle could have done many other things. He was a very learned man, a very
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.720]   erudite man. After all, this was the man who had sat at the feet of Gamaliel and who's
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.440]   entitled to say, as he does say in Philippians 3, that as regards his knowledge of the law,
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:24.380]   well, he was afraid of no competitor. He was a brilliant man. His epistles prove this.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:31.700]   A man of tremendous mental ability, a great logician. And he had knowledge and he could
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:39.140]   have preached on many themes. But he tells us that he deliberately decided not to do
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:45.140]   so, though he knew the attitude of the people to whom he was going to preach. And of course
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:53.020]   he elaborates this later on in the third chapter. He uses an expression like this, "Let no man
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:09:01.820]   deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:11.820]   fool that he may be made wise." And later on he uses this expression. He says that he
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:22.180]   has become a fool for Christ's sake. This was a deliberate decision, a determination
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:29.380]   on his part. He has decided that in the eyes of the wise and the learned, the Greeks and
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:35.660]   the Jews, he's going to be a fool. That is what they said about him. Even some of the
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.340]   members of the church at Corinth were now tending to say this about him. They said,
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:47.140]   after all, his presence was weak and his speech was contemptible. They were tending to regard
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.900]   him as a fool. And you remember when he was in Athens, those Epicureans and Stoics said,
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:10:01.620]   "What will this babbler say?" Well now the apostle says, "I determined to become a fool.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:10.140]   I have become a fool for Christ's sake." So I'm emphasizing this, that this was a very
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:18.240]   deliberate determination on the part of the apostle. And all this idea that people were
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.540]   primitive in those times and hadn't the learning and the knowledge that we have today is just,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:30.300]   of course, nonsense, because this is one of the great minds of all the centuries. I remember
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:36.740]   during the last war, I read a notice in a paper that the British Academy, a very learned,
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:44.460]   non-Christian society, the British Academy, a secular society, decided to inaugurate a
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:51.820]   series of lectures on the theme, "The Great Minds of the Ages." And I was interested to
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:59.140]   read the prospectus and to see who were the great minds of the centuries in their estimate,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:05.180]   this secular society. And of course he was there, the apostle Paul. You can't understand
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.500]   civilization. You can't understand the great history of the world without knowing something
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:17.780]   about this man and his writings and his teachings. Yet here he is telling us that he deliberately
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:26.860]   decided not to know anything among them save Jesus Christ and him crucified. And my suggestion
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:33.420]   to you tonight, my friends, is this, that until the Church comes back to this same decision,
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.660]   she's going to avail nothing. And to me the tragedy of the hour is that the Church is
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:45.540]   almost doing the exact opposite of what is said here by the great apostle. Now the motives
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.940]   I know are good. People are out to win people, and they're resorting to various messages
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:56.500]   and means and methods because they think this is what's going to appeal. But it doesn't
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:02.300]   seem to be succeeding, is it? And I see no hope until we return to the method and the
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:09.980]   manner and the message of the great apostle and arrive at this great decision, this determination
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:16.180]   of his. This is our mandate. This is what we are here to proclaim. We are to be fools
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:24.340]   for Christ's sake, as the apostle was. But let's put it like this to you. Why did the
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:31.700]   apostle decide not to preach anything else? That's the interesting thing, isn't it? He
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:43.660]   decides, but why? As I've already reminded you, the argument is that if we are to win
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:50.420]   the modern man, well then we must talk about the things in which he's interested. This
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:56.020]   is the modern man. He doesn't know the language of the Bible. That's why we're getting a new
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:02.740]   translation almost every week. This is the argument, isn't it? And they say it's no use
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:08.780]   preaching that old gospel to people. They're not interested. The terminology is gone. You
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.940]   must sit down by their sides and talk to them about the things they really are interested
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:21.100]   in. And then you have a chance of winning them. I remember a great ecclesiastic preaching
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:29.740]   once. I heard him myself. The sermon was broadcast on the wireless. And this man said quite deliberately
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:36.500]   that if you wanted to turn the people of North Africa, he was dealing with in particular,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.900]   if you wanted to turn them into Christians, well it was no use, he said, sending men out
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:47.700]   with this old gospel so-called. The way to win them, he said, is to go out and live amongst
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:53.180]   them. Take part in their local politics, in their general politics. Mix with them. And
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:59.380]   then he said you have some hope that perhaps their grandchildren will be able to have some
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:05.220]   Christian influence and effect upon such nations and peoples. Now this has been the popular
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:11.900]   idea. And it's the exact opposite, you see, of what the apostle teaches us here.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.420]   Now what were the things that Paul could have preached about? What were the things that
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:23.740]   those Greeks in Corinth were interested in? Well we know exactly. There were Jews amongst
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:30.780]   them, he refers to them, and they were interested in the law, the Jewish law. And they would
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.940]   have liked him to have preached about the law and expounded the law and its meaning.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.620]   There were many such people, as you know, in the early days of the Christian church.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.460]   It started amongst the Jews. And the Pharisees and Sadducees and others used to go and listen.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.540]   And they were interested in the law. And such people crept into the churches. And they always
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:15:01.780]   wanted preachers to preach about the law. But others, the more purely Greek people,
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:07.860]   not the Hellenized Jews, but the Greeks as such, they of course were tremendously interested
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:15.180]   in philosophy. Now everybody knows that the Greeks, the ancient Greeks, were perhaps the
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:20.540]   most intelligent nation that the world has ever known. And it was Greece that produced
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:26.220]   the greatest succession of philosophers that the world has ever known. We still know their
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:33.820]   names, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle. They're the great masters. And people are still studying
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:41.300]   what these men taught. They had their academies and porches corresponding to our modern universities.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:47.620]   And they were interested in these great problems. What's philosophy? Well, it's a study of life,
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:54.700]   how to live, how to live happily and harmoniously, the nature of man and the nature of life and
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:01.700]   world and all these great problems. The Greeks were tremendously interested in this. And
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.380]   whenever there was an address on this kind of thing or a discussion, there they would
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:14.740]   crowd. They lived on this. And of course, a subsection of philosophy was politics. Politics
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.140]   is not something new, you know. The great philosophers, they were concerned about how
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:26.100]   to live. And they drew up their plans for what they called utopia. And they talked about
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:33.940]   the ideal state and the ideal city. And they worked it out in detail, how various avocations
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.660]   were to be divided up and men were to work in these various spheres and all was going
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:46.020]   to be happy. Politics, they have a great deal to say about that. And they're still regarded
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.940]   as authorities on this subject. Where does the word democracy come from? Well, it comes
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:57.460]   from them. They invented this word. All these great theories about how we are to live and
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.340]   how we are to be governed and so on. They were tremendously interested in all this.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:08.580]   And another great interest, of course, was culture in general. They had great poets.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:15.660]   They had great dramatists. And these works are still being studied and still being considered.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.860]   And they were very interested in it all. Then, of course, they were very interested in art,
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:26.660]   particularly in architecture and in sculpture. And you can still go and look at the ruins
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:33.780]   of the great buildings that they put up. And we in this country possess some of the great
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:40.900]   examples of their sculpture. And on top of it all, they were interested in sport. They
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:47.620]   are the people who started the Olympic games and the marathon races and so on. Well, now,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:55.060]   these were the topics that were of great interest to the people who lived in Corinth. But the
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:18:01.300]   apostle says, "I determined, I decided not to preach about any of those things whatsoever."
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:06.700]   They would have liked him to do so. They wanted him to do so. They expected him to do so.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:13.020]   At first, they regarded him as a fool because he didn't do so. And he didn't do so quite
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:21.340]   deliberately. Now, why didn't he do so? And you see, this is what is so interesting. He
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:29.940]   tells us exactly why he didn't. It's in the sixth verse. "Howbeit we speak wisdom"—this
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:36.300]   is philosophy, politics, all these things, education, the things I've been talking about—"we
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:45.540]   speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:19:00.340]   princes of this world that come to naught." Nothing. A cipher. A blank. They come to nothing.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:06.140]   That's why he didn't preach about them. And you know, this is not a matter of theory.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:13.980]   This is a sheer fact. And this is what's so important for us to grasp at a time such as
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:22.540]   this. All these things had already failed before the Son of God ever came into this
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:30.740]   world, before Paul ever began to preach. They'd all been tried with great thoroughness, but
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:35.860]   they'd all failed. Take this desire amongst the Jews that he should have preached the
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:42.860]   law. What's the answer to that? Well, the apostle gives the answer to that in the third
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:49.060]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans, verse 20. "By the deeds of the law shall no man
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:57.020]   be justified in his sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin." And it doesn't
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:02.900]   go any further. It proves to us that we are sinners, but it can't save us. Remember how
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.460]   he puts it again in the third verse of the eighth chapter of his epistle to the Romans.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:15.020]   "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh." God sending
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:21.960]   his own Son, etc. The law couldn't do it. The law was a failure. The apostle argues
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.420]   about this in many places in his epistles. Men and women could not keep the law. What's
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:35.580]   the point of preaching the law then? It comes to naught. It leaves us helpless under condemnation.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.420]   And though we may be great interested in this point of view and that, and argue and debate,
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:47.060]   if we are failures, moral failures and sinners, and the law can't help us, what's the point
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:52.580]   of preaching the law? Well, that's the answer to that. And of course it was exactly the
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:21:03.980]   same with regard to this great philosophy, this speculation as to man and his nature,
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:12.540]   life, death, and so on. This drawing up of the plans for utopia. What did it all come
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.740]   to? Well, you know, we know the answer, don't we? The apostle himself gives us the answer
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:25.140]   in many places, and this is why he didn't preach philosophy and politics and all these
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:31.900]   various other matters. The most terrifying answer is in a sense that which is given in
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:39.060]   the first chapter of his epistle to the Romans, where he gives us an account of life in that
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:46.140]   ancient world. It's this, "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools and changed
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.460]   the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible men and to
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:58.380]   birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things. Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:06.700]   through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves. God gave
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:13.540]   them up into vile affections, for even their women did change their natural use into that
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:20.740]   which is against nature. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:27.700]   burned in their lust one toward another. Men with men working that which is unseemly and
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:33.020]   receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat." That was the
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.540]   way in which they were living, the great land of philosophy, the great land of learning
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:44.420]   and of Roman law. And this is how he winds up his description of them, "Being filled
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:53.140]   with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy,
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:23:01.420]   murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud,
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:08.380]   boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:16.100]   breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful. Who, knowing the judgment of God
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:23.020]   that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.820]   in them that do them." With all the learning and the greatest philosophers that had already
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:36.060]   come and gone and had been dead two or three centuries, in spite of all this, that was
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.780]   the state of society. That was the state of men and women speaking generally in this great
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:48.660]   city of Corinth. So that's why the apostle decided that he wasn't going to preach these
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:55.820]   things. They've come to naught. They don't achieve anything. So why waste your breath
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:01.780]   in preaching things that are ultimately valueless and useless? "Ah, yes," says someone, "but
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.860]   that's the first century, and we are living in the twentieth century, and we've split
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:12.860]   the atom and can lend people on the moon, and we are now prospecting the surface of
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:19.140]   Mars. And look at the great learning and science and tremendous advances, especially of the
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.740]   last hundred years. Is what you're saying true? Are you telling us that we are to be
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:30.500]   fools? Are you saying that the Christian church today is not to know anything of these things
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.220]   amongst the people, that this is not what they need?" Well, that is precisely what I
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:43.260]   am saying. And I am saying that the modern world is proving the dictum of the apostle.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:52.020]   All these things have come to naught, and the state of the world tonight is proving
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:57.780]   it. That's why it's in such terrible trouble. Because we, you see, have gone in for the
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:03.020]   same things. People have turned from religion during the last hundred years. What have they
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:11.100]   turned to? Philosophy, science, politics. These are the things. Education. These are
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.500]   the things that were going to make a perfect world.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.580]   Now you needn't take my word for this. I'm going to read to you a number of quotations
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:26.780]   from great names in the realm of thought for you to see what they say. You needn't take
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:32.260]   the word of a little preacher, a fool in a Christian pulpit. Listen to these men. Take
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:40.380]   the great man Tolstoy, the great novelist Count Tolstoy. This is what he said, amongst
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:52.340]   other things. "The meaningless absurdity of life is the only incontestable knowledge accessible
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:26:02.420]   to man." The meaningless absurdity of life. And here's a man who spent a lifetime considering
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:09.580]   these problems, trying to understand, trying to find a way out. That's his conclusion.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:20.340]   Another, let me quote you another. Last year was the centenary of the birth of a man who
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:26.820]   was very well known, especially until, say, the beginning of the last war. You've all
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:36.180]   heard of the WEA, Workers' Educational Association. Now the man who started that was a man whose
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:44.380]   name was Albert Mansbridge. And there have been references to him during the last year
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:51.460]   because he was the man who conceived this idea that the working classes were living
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:27:00.620]   in squalor and unhappy and slaves of drink and all that characterized what General William
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:07.900]   Booth described as darkest England. He said the sole cause of this is ignorance. He said
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:13.380]   the only thing to do is to take knowledge and information to the working classes. So
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:23.060]   he started these classes amongst the working people, the Workers' Educational Association.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:30.740]   And you know, in 1903, when this WEA was really inaugurated, Albert Mansbridge said, "If
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:38.540]   only the working classes can be educated, the solution to all the problems is bound
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:50.020]   to follow." Education, he said, leads to emancipation. Emancipation is rarely education.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:55.420]   He was quite convinced, and many with him. I'm not detracting from the work that he did.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:02.980]   But this was the idea, that if only you educated people, gave them knowledge, the problems
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:10.620]   would be solved. Or take another one, Mr. Morris Ginsberg, writing on the idea of progress
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:21.340]   in Essays in Sociology and Social Philosophy in 1968. He puts it like this, "Modern psychological
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:32.460]   theories expose the naivety of the assumption which earlier theories had taken for granted,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:43.180]   that intellectual advance will be necessarily reflected in improved human relationships."
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:51.220]   That was the idea. He said it was naive, but people did believe it, that intellectual advance,
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:29:02.780]   education, knowledge, culture, would necessarily, of necessity, be reflected in improved human
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:08.780]   relationships. That's what our Victorian grandfathers really believed. They were quite confident
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.340]   of it.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:17.660]   Take another, Professor Arnold Toynbee. Now, here is one of the great historians of all
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:26.220]   times. You remember he wrote a massive history of the world, at first in ten volumes, eventually
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:33.740]   some twelve volumes. He wasn't a Christian, but he had studied human history. He was trying
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:40.700]   to understand life, with the ultimate objective, of course, of discovering what we had to do
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:47.820]   in order to make life happy and successful in this world. Now, in his very last book,
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:53.700]   which had the title, "Mankind and Mother Earth," and was only published last year, this is
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:30:03.900]   what he says, "There is a morality gap in the development of mankind. Man constantly
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:14.740]   extends his physical power over the environment, but he is unable to improve his social arrangements
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:24.460]   correspondingly, still less to subdue his destructive passions. Technology is the only
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:31.140]   field of human activity in which there has been progress, progression."
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:37.860]   Now, that's Arnold Toynbee. He wasn't a Christian, but he's got to face facts, and there are
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:44.700]   the facts staring us in the face. Take the men who really founded Czechoslovakia after
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:50.460]   the end of the First World War, that great patriot, Thomas Masaryk. He was not only a
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:56.900]   great patriot and politician, but a great philosopher, and yet he said this, "The philosophers
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:06.540]   have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:12.620]   All the philosophers can do," he says, "is to interpret the world in various ways, but
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:19.380]   what the world needs is to be changed, and they can't do it," says a philosopher, Thomas
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:30.300]   Masaryk. And finally, Aldous Huxley, a novelist, a thinker, a very able man, coming from the
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:38.100]   brilliant family of the Huxleys. This man started his life by believing in science.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:44.860]   He ended his life by being a Buddhist. But this is what you can read about him in the
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:52.900]   biography published recently. At the end of his life, having given the whole of his life
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.940]   to teaching us how to live, brave new world, and so on and so forth, this is what he said
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:04.700]   at the end of his life, "It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:16.580]   all one's life, and that at the end one has no more to offer by way of advice than try
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:26.380]   to be a little kinder." Need I say any more about this? Paul says, "I haven't preached
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:32.820]   these things." Why? It comes to naught. It comes to nothing. And the same thing is true
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:40.220]   tonight. For a century we've trusted to philosophy, to science, to education, culture, knowledge,
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.900]   and all our busted events. Of course, as these men say, there has been brilliant technological
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:51.820]   events. But look at your world. Look at the chaos of the world tonight. Look at human
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:59.220]   relationships. Look at the drug addiction. Look at the terrible squalor. The world has
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:05.260]   never been in greater trouble, my dear friends. That's why we don't preach these things.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:11.460]   But there are people telling us that the church ought to turn to politics and to social affairs,
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.940]   and they're giving their pompous opinions in their world congresses as to what governments
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.300]   and others should do. And we are told that we should be participating in what the people
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:31.340]   are interested in. No, no. I determined, and that's why he determined, and we must determine.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:39.060]   All these things, with all the good that is in some of them, eventually come to naught.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:45.060]   They don't enable you out to live, to resist temptation. They can't give you happiness,
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:51.620]   peace, joy. They leave you bereft, and on your deathbed you've got nothing. They come,
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:34:01.740]   says Paul, to naught, to nothing, emptiness, vanity, vanity of vanities. All is vanity.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:07.740]   Very well. That's why he determined not to know anything among them. But let me not end
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:20.380]   on a negative. I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:27.380]   This is what he preached, and this is only what he preached, nothing else. And this is
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:33.460]   our only message tonight to this world. I'm not competent to tell the new President of
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.900]   the United States what he ought to do. Some of these ecclesiastics seem to think they
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:43.220]   can. What do they know? How can there be authorities on all these subjects? They cannot. They're
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:50.980]   wasting their time, wasting their breath, wasting their money. What does the world need?
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:58.780]   It needs to be told about Jesus Christ and him crucified. This is my message, says Paul.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:04.460]   Well, why did he determine only to preach this? Here are some answers. Work them out
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:12.340]   for yourselves. The first is, of course, that this is what he was commanded to preach. His
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:20.420]   men never decided to be a preacher. He was appointed, met the Lord of glory on the road
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:28.580]   to Damascus, who said, "You're going to be a minister and a witness." He gave him a commission,
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:36.980]   and he told him what to preach. The Apostle Paul was not a philosopher as such. His message
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:43.500]   was not something he'd worked out. It was the message that was given to him. He talks
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:52.140]   about the deposit. He talks about this faith. "That which I have received," he keeps on
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:58.780]   saying. This is the first reason, therefore, why he decided not to do anything else. He
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:04.340]   was an honest man. And as he was commanded and given a commission, he called himself,
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.500]   you remember, an ambassador. What's the business of an ambassador? Well, it's not to voice
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:16.980]   his own opinions. It's to represent his government. It's to say what he's told to say. He may
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:21.940]   have many ideas. That's not his business. He's not to give his private opinions. He's
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:28.540]   the representative of his country. Paul says, "I am an ambassador for Christ." So he's
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:36.020]   simply carrying out the mandate that was given to him. And this should be true of every preacher.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:43.980]   He's servants of God. You are master proclaim and publish abroad his wonderful name.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:51.580]   But let me go on. He gives us some marvelous reasons here. And you know I can't understand
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:57.500]   how any man who claims to be called to preach can preach on any of these other themes that
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.780]   people have got their itching ears. I'm told I should be preaching about modern art and
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:09.420]   showing the superiority of Christian art to modern art and drama and novels. Ah, my dear
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.140]   friends, people who talk like that, they don't know these great and glorious things that
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:19.620]   the apostle speaks about here. Why did he only preach this message? Well, he tells us.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:28.680]   This is the testimony of God. "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:37.420]   of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God, God's message." Or
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:44.420]   he puts it again in another way in these words, in verse 10. "But God hath revealed them
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:56.860]   unto us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:03.820]   And here you see is a new realm altogether. This is why I don't preach philosophy or politics
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:10.900]   or sociology. It's the message of God. The world is upside down. The world's in trouble.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:16.740]   All the experts, philosophers, scientists, educationists, economists, they're all arguing
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.740]   with one another. You can't get two of them to agree as to what's needed and what can
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.260]   be done. Nevertheless, with the world being so busy in trying to solve its problems and
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.020]   to put itself in order, and it's all leading to naught, to nothing, to absolute failure,
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:36.540]   what's the greatest need of the world tonight? To know God's plan. God's plan. And this
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:45.780]   was Paul's message. We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery. Even the hidden wisdom which
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:56.100]   God ordained before the foundation of the world. Now, this is the message of the church.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:05.220]   God's message. And as I say, isn't this our greatest need? Men are failing. The world
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:15.620]   is in utter darkness. What's the need? Oh, to listen to God's view of it all. What God
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:25.140]   thinks of it all. God's message. God's remedy for it all. And it's all here in the Bible.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:29.300]   You see, the Bible tells us plainly that the world is as it is because it's turned its
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:37.740]   back upon God. That's the whole trouble. Man was put in paradise. It was perfect. A life
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:43.700]   of unmixed bliss. How has life become what it is? Because man rebelled against God because
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:50.380]   he sinned. The way of the transgressor is hard. There is no peace, saith my God, to
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:56.340]   the wicked. This is what God says. It isn't an economic problem or a political problem.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:02.380]   It's a moral, it's a religious problem. Man is strange from God. Man under the wrath of
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:10.660]   God. I've already quoted from Romans 1, and there it is. Paul says, "I am not ashamed
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:16.860]   of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:22.540]   to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:28.660]   from faith to faith, as it is written, 'For just shall live by faith.' For because the
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:36.180]   wrath of God from him has already been revealed upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:44.180]   men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness." This is what God says. Are you aware of this,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:49.460]   my friend? Isn't this what the world needs to know? Am I to be wasting my time in giving
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:54.460]   my political and social opinions when I'm telling you that God says there's only one
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:41:04.020]   source of all our troubles? It is our alienation from him. It is our sinfulness. And the wrath
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:11.900]   of God is upon this modern world, quite plainly to be seen. As God had abandoned those ancient
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:17.340]   civilizations to the terrible things that I read to you from Romans 1, he's doing it
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:22.820]   again. What I read there might very well be a description of London tonight, all the horrible
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:29.300]   perversions and everything else. It's the same thing once more. It's the wrath of God
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:36.980]   upon men as a rebel and men in sin. But thank God it's not only diagnosis. It's the only
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:42.820]   diagnosis. It's the only truth about the world tonight. That's why you get industrial strife
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:48.460]   and all these things. Selfishness, greed, the things Paul enumerated. You can't trust
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:55.220]   anybody. Everybody out for himself. That's man in sin. That's the problem. And it's no
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.820]   use to philosophize about this. Something's got to be done about it. Well, says Paul,
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:09.300]   God has done something about it. God has ordained a plan for the salvation of the world, even
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:20.140]   before he'd created the world. What is it? Well, here he puts it in these words, "Jesus
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:29.660]   Christ and him crucified." If Paul had no other reason for not preaching the other things,
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:40.060]   this would be enough, the person, Jesus Christ. This is what God has done. "All loving wisdom
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:46.820]   of our God when all was sin and shame. The second Adam to the fight and to the conflict
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:54.660]   came." Is the world hopeless? Are we all hopeless? Of course not. God so loved the world that
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:43:04.020]   he gave his only begotten son. It's the great message concerning Jesus of Nazareth, the
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:13.820]   babe that was born in a stable in Bethlehem. Who was he? He's the eternal son of God. The
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:19.940]   great message of the incarnation. This is God's love for the world, God's concern for
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.580]   the world. He'd given the law, they couldn't keep it. The philosophers had come and taught
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:31.700]   it, they couldn't change anybody or anything. But God has intervened. "When the fullness
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:38.220]   of the times had come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman made under the law, to
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:44.100]   redeem them that are under the law." This is the thing that thrilled the life of this
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:50.820]   apostle. He'd been an opponent of Jesus Christ. He'd been a blasphemer, a persecutor of the
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:55.380]   church. He'd tried to destroy the church. Here he is as the apostle and the preacher.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:01.140]   Why? Well, he met him on the road to Damascus. There he is traveling and suddenly sees that
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:06.620]   light and he sees the face and he fell helpless to the ground. And he heard a voice saying,
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:12.780]   "Paul, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And looking back at this amazing face, he
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:20.820]   said, "Who art thou, Lord?" And the answer came back, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest."
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:27.940]   And he never got over it. The despised Jesus of Nazareth is the eternal Son of God. He
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:34.180]   calls him here, as you notice, "the Lord of glory." None of the princes of this world
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:41.540]   knew him, for had they known it, they would not have crucified. The Lord of glory? My
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:46.580]   dear friends, this is the only hope tonight and thus why this is the only message. God
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:53.140]   has sent his only Son into the world. It's a great mystery. It's a marvel. It's a miracle.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:59.380]   The perfect Son of God laid aside the signs of his eternal glory and was born of a woman,
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:06.540]   born of a virgin, born in a stable in abject poverty, lived amongst men, worked with his
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:13.820]   people, worked miracles, gave his incomparable teaching, had conquest over the elements,
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:22.700]   conquered all his enemies, the devil included, Jesus Christ, but then particularly and him
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:32.020]   crucified. This thing that was a stumbling block to the Jews and to the Greeks' foolishness.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:37.380]   But I preach it, says Paul. Why? Because it's essential. It's the only way we can be saved.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:42.860]   The teaching of Christ doesn't save us. It becomes a philosophy if you stop at the teaching.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:47.420]   And it's more impossible than any other teaching. It's all very well to talk about imitating
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:52.400]   Christ. Have you ever tried it? You can't do it. You can't come up to your own standard.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:58.780]   How can you imitate Christ? He damns us, every one of us. He was without sin. He was perfect.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:07.060]   No, no. He doesn't save us by his teaching. He doesn't save us even by his perfect life.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:13.380]   These are parts of it. But the crucial act is what happened on the cross on Calvary's
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:21.980]   hill. Jesus Christ and him crucified. Why? Well, because, says Paul, that is the power
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:28.100]   of God and the wisdom of God in this way. Our great need, you see, is to be reconciled
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:34.980]   to God. How can it happen? How can a man be just with God? He can't. Do what he will.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:41.260]   He can't. How can I get rid of my sin? It's my sin that comes between me and God. God
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:46.180]   regardeth not sinners and he doesn't listen to them. I've got to get rid of this sin.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:53.380]   I can't do it. There's only one way to get rid of sin. It's God's way. God hath laid
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:47:00.220]   on him the iniquity of us all. He's the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:05.300]   God hath made him, as Paul says in the second epistle, chapter 5, God hath made him to be
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:11.260]   sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. My
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:16.660]   dear friends, Jesus Christ and him crucified. This is the most amazing thing that has ever
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:22.460]   happened in this world. You ask me to preach about politics and sociology? I can't. I've
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:29.820]   got something so glorious to say before you. When I surveyed the wondrous cross on which
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:40.620]   the Prince of Glory died, my richest gain I count but loss and poor contempt and all
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:48.580]   my pride were the whole realm of nature mine. That were an offering far too small. Love
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:57.940]   so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all. Christ, he damns us, every one
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:06.540]   of us. He was without sin. He was perfect. No, no. He doesn't save us by his teaching.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:13.260]   He doesn't save us even by his perfect life. These are parts of it. But the crucial act
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:21.300]   is what happened on the cross on Calvary's hill. Jesus Christ and him crucified. Why?
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:28.060]   Well because, says Paul, that is the power of God and the wisdom of God in this way.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:32.900]   Our great need, you see, is to be reconciled to God. How can it happen? How can a man be
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:40.460]   just with God? He can't. Do what he will? He can't. How can I get rid of my sin? It's
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:45.140]   my sin that comes between me and God. God regardeth not sinners and he doesn't listen
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:51.100]   to them. I've got to get rid of this sin. I can't do it. There's only one way to get
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:58.380]   rid of sin. It's God's way. God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He's the Lamb
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:04.400]   of God that taketh away the sin of the world. God hath made him, as Paul says in the second
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.420]   epistle, chapter 5, God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.820]   be made the righteousness of God in him. My dear friends, Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.620]   This is the most amazing thing that has ever happened in this world. You ask me to preach
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:27.700]   about politics and sociology? I can't. I've got something so glorious to say before you.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:37.740]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, my riches gained
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:45.740]   I count but loss and poor contempt on all my pride, where the whole realm of nature
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:55.980]   mine that were an offering far too small. Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul,
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:01.900]   my life, my all. Preach about these other things? It's impossible. The most astounding
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:08.020]   thing that's ever happened. The author of life dying, the sinless one bearing the punishment
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:15.060]   of sin. That's God's wisdom. That's God's power. That's God's way of salvation. That's
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.580]   why he determined not to know anything else.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:25.980]   And finally, the last reason is this. Because of what all this does for us. Look at verse
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:32.780]   1. "As it is written, 'Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:42.060]   heart of men the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.' A world in trouble.
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:48.060]   I've got to tell you, says Paul, about what God has prepared for you. The results of this
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:54.580]   action of his in sending his own son not only into the world, but even to the death of the
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:51:03.860]   cross on Calvary's hill. This works. It does something. It succeeds. It's prepared things
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:10.220]   for us that nothing else can give us. What are these things that God has prepared for
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:20.220]   us? Well, they're wonderful. The first is forgiveness. You lose your sense of guilt.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:27.140]   You lose your sense of the fear of death and the grave. We've all got to die, my friends.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:33.620]   And politics can't help you to die, nor philosophy, nor any one of these things. These are the
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:45.900]   ultimate problems. But here is a way of forgiveness. Reconcile to God. The wrath of God has been
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:52.460]   satisfied. He's poured it on his son who's borne our punishment in his own body on the
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:52:01.220]   cross. So we are forgiven without doing anything, without money, without price, just as you
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:09.220]   are, without one plea. This is it. What a message. The things that God has prepared
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:17.380]   for them that love him. Forgiveness, peace with God, reconciliation with God, knowing
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:25.300]   that God is my Father, able to go to him in prayer with confidence and assurance, by whom
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:31.460]   we have access into this faith wherein we stand, says Paul. When all things seem against
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:37.820]   me to drive me to despair, and it may be coming if there's industrial and economic collapse,
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:45.620]   but when all things seem against me to drive me to despair, I know one gate is open. One
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:54.460]   ear will hear my prayer. Access to God in prayer and assurance that he's ready to receive
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:53:06.020]   me, not only that new life. Joy, a joy unspeakable and full of glory. All that is possible in
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:12.900]   this life and in this world. Though hell may be raging round and about us, there is a peace
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:20.380]   of God that passes all understanding, available to us in spite of hell itself. These are some
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:26.980]   of the things that God has prepared for them that love him, but not only that. It not only
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:37.020]   offers these things to us, new life, a new outlook upon everything, and above all, a
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:43.220]   new hope. We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:50.460]   ordained before the world and to our glory. The glory begins here, but it doesn't end
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:57.220]   here. The Christian can smile in the face of death. He knows that there's a glorious
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:03.580]   future. It doesn't depend upon politics and men. We see what they come to. It comes to
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:09.820]   naught. But you know, I don't know how people can live in a time like this without believing
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:17.900]   this. There's a day coming when God is going to send his only son back again into this
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:26.260]   world, not as the babe of Bethlehem this time, but as the King of kings and the Lord of lords,
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:32.180]   riding the clouds of heaven, conquering and to conquer. He'll come and he'll judge the
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:38.500]   whole world in righteousness. And all who opposed him and hated him will be cast to
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:46.500]   eternal perdition. And then he'll renovate the whole universe. And you and I will believe
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:54.660]   in him. We'll be changed even in our very bodies and be like unto him and spend our
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:55:02.420]   eternity with him in the glory everlasting. That's the message. That's what it means
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:10.500]   by Jesus Christ and him crucified. And you see, this is not theory. This works. This
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:16.740]   does happen. This is the great story of the Christian church. Why does Paul say, "I
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.060]   determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified"? The answer
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:27.700]   is this, because of what it had done to him himself. There he is, Saul of Tarsus, very
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:35.300]   learned, very able, better than anybody else, self-righteous, proud, fairiesy, great mound
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:44.540]   of righteousness. But when he met this Lord, it all became dung and loss and refuse. He
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:54.500]   became a new man. For the first time in his life, he knew real peace. He knew real joy.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:02.460]   And he thrilled at every recollection of it. He's a new man. I'm not ashamed of the gospel
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:09.860]   of Christ. Why? It is the power of God unto salvation. It had revolutionized his life
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:15.620]   and made a new man and a very happy man of him. A man who lived a glorious life and who
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:22.420]   could look forward to a triumphant death and entering into the glory everlasting. But it
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:29.820]   not only worked in the case of Paul. The apostle reminds these Corinthians how it had worked
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:35.620]   amongst them. Listen to this. In chapter 6, "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:43.860]   inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:50.460]   nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:58.780]   drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such,
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:10.460]   where some of you, but you have been washed, you have been sanctified, you have been justified
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:18.780]   in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God." Learning and sculpture and all
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:24.380]   the glory of Rome and of Greece together could not do for these people living in the Dockland
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:34.980]   area of Corinth. Jesus Christ had done. They had been lifted up. They had been born again
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:42.820]   and they were saints. And he addresses them as the saints who are at Corinth. And it has
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:48.900]   been doing the same ever since. I could keep you to midnight telling you about the wonders
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:56.420]   of redeeming grace. A man like Augustine, a brilliant philosopher living with his mistress,
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:06.020]   a complete failure, entirely delivered. Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Knox, all these
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:14.460]   mighty men throughout the ages and the centuries, the glorious company of apostles, the martyrs,
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:22.100]   these giants who lived in this world, they all attributed to Jesus Christ. And thank
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:29.820]   God. We can still say the same thing today. When everything else is failing, Jesus Christ
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:36.700]   and him crucified can still succeed, is still succeeding. There is power, power, mighty
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:41.980]   working power in the precious blood of the Lamb. That's why our business is to preach
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:48.260]   Jesus Christ and him crucified and nothing else. This is the only thing that can help
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:53.980]   the individual. This is the only thing that can help society and the world. Do you know
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:59.820]   it, my friend? Is this your one theme, the biggest thing in your life? Do you rejoice
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:05.740]   in it? And are you telling men and women what their real need is and the only answer to
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:12.620]   that need and the only solution to our every problem? Jesus Christ, if we but knew him
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:19.620]   and saw the glory of his death on the cross. God forbid, says Paul, that I should glory
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:25.580]   save in the cross of my Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:34.940]   I unto the world. Can you say that? That is true Christianity.
