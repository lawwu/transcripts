[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.720]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.560]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.800]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.280]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.960]   journey to find all the hacks.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.240]   Now I've had a lot of conversations about money and travel, but today's
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.800]   conversation is something different.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.760]   And honestly, it was so amazing.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.040]   I had to go back and re-listen to it so I could take notes myself.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's a conversation with Kwame Christian, all about negotiating, and it's something
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.720]   he definitely knows a lot about.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.760]   Kwame's a practicing attorney.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.280]   He's the director of the American Negotiation Institute, a professor of
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.920]   negotiation at The Ohio State University.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.480]   He's the host of the world's most popular negotiation podcast, Negotiate
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.200]   Anything, and the bestselling author of Finding Confidence in Conflict, How to
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.640]   Negotiate Anything and Live Your Best Life.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.480]   I aspire to have a resume like that one day.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.600]   And in our conversation, we'll get into so many different ways that you can
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.920]   become a better negotiator, not just in business deals or at work, but in
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.240]   difficult conversations with your partner, your family, or your friends.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.120]   I think you're really going to enjoy this one.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.960]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.880]   Kwame, thanks for being here.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.600]   Hey, glad to be here, Chris.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   So what do you think most people get wrong when it comes to negotiating?
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.840]   Well, a lot of times when they think about negotiation, they focus on what
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   are the amazing, insightful things that they can say.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.000]   And in reality, negotiation is more about the amazing and
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.760]   insightful questions that you ask.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.440]   If you can just simply start asking better questions, you're going to get
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   better results in your negotiations.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.600]   And obviously, if you're in sales or you're a lawyer like yourself,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.560]   negotiating is a part of business.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   But I assume this is a skill that is valuable for anyone?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.200]   Absolutely.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.520]   And so our motto is that the best things in life are on the other
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.840]   side of difficult conversations.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   So when you think about it, when you analyze your life, when you think about
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.160]   the most impactful moments, the biggest decisions, there's probably a difficult
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.360]   conversation somewhere in the vicinity of that moment.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.080]   So to a large extent, your success and failure, happiness and sadness, all of
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   those are going to come down to how well or how poorly you have these difficult
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.800]   conversations.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.200]   And that's both in your personal and professional life.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640]   And do you think there are people who are naturally better at negotiating?
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.320]   Is there kind of a correlated skill set or anything like that?
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.000]   I will answer that with some hesitation because the answer is obviously yes.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.200]   For sure there is.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.760]   But I don't want to give people a pass because a lot of times people will just
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.280]   say, "I'm not a good negotiator."
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.120]   But I correct them before I answer their question or respond.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.080]   I just say, "You're not a good negotiator yet."
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.040]   And so this reminds me back, I believe, Carol Dweck and Mindset, the book on
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.600]   Mindset.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.320]   You can either have the growth mindset or you can have the fixed mindset.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.640]   And a lot of people have a fixed mindset when it comes to negotiation and
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.000]   difficult conversation or persuasion because they say, "Either I'm born with
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.920]   it or I don't have it."
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.320]   And so the people who say, "I'm not born with it," they just say, "I'm going to be
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.280]   relegated to living a life of failure and doom and bad conversations."
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.480]   But that's not the case.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.760]   And in fact, some of the people who are most likely to say, "I'm not a good
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   negotiator," they actually have the foundation to become better negotiators.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.160]   So for instance, somebody who's more naturally introverted.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.560]   So they're not going to have the problem of over-speaking.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   They're going to be more likely to be better listeners.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.320]   They're going to be more generous in their way of communicating.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.320]   And so that's actually perhaps a better personality-based foundation for having
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.480]   difficult conversations.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.320]   How do you think someone should evaluate where they're at today and how big of a
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.720]   gap they have to close to be a great negotiator?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.960]   I like to be outcome-oriented on this, Chris.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.720]   So I would think about the outcomes, but it can't just be the outcomes because
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.520]   sometimes people succeed despite their poor natural tendencies.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.040]   So for instance, if you are somebody who is very loud, aggressive, and mean,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.840]   you're a bully, you might just say, "Yeah, I always get what I want.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.640]   So I'm good at this."
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.920]   It doesn't necessarily mean that you're good.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.880]   It just means that you haven't run into that limitation yet, because eventually
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.720]   somebody is going to figure out how to deal with a bully.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.280]   You're going to have one tool, the tool doesn't work, and now you're kind of lost.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.760]   And so you have to think about the outcome, but not just the outcome.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.640]   Because when you think about negotiation, yes, of course, it's a process and it's
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.720]   also the outcome too.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.400]   And the outcome can't just be limited to what we're talking about numbers-wise.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.160]   So let's say we're talking about a deal.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   I know you have your background in finance and some work there.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.960]   So for instance, numbers matter.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.040]   I can't get around that.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.960]   Numbers do matter.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.640]   But in the business world, relationships matter too.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.480]   So if you're getting a good number in this deal, but damaging the relationship
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   at the same time, it might have a negative impact on you going forward in your
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.680]   future negotiations too.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.240]   So you have to look at it a little bit more holistically.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.800]   I've always heard an adage of a great negotiation is when both parties are a
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.640]   little dissatisfied walking away.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.800]   Is that the right way to look at it?
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.600]   Or is there a better kind of guide for a successful negotiation?
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.440]   Yeah, there's definitely a better way to look at it.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.600]   Because if you're going in and you're saying yes, with this mentality, you're
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.280]   saying, yes, both of us will be in pain at the end of it, then you're going to
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.400]   naturally start to take paths that take you in that direction too.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.760]   I think it's really important for you to have a very clear understanding of what
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.400]   it is that you want and why.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.000]   And then also at the same time, go through this process, the negotiation
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.440]   process, in order to figure out what it is that they want and why.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.160]   And not just taking the first thing that they say, right?
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.360]   So you have to dig beneath the surface to figure that out.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   Because what you can find is very unique areas of overlap.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.000]   That's where creativity comes into play.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.040]   And who knows, depending on the circumstances, we might be able to find
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.360]   that classic win-win, I'm ambivalent toward that term, but I know people
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.560]   understand it, that we're all looking for.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.200]   Oh, this wasn't as bad for me.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.640]   Oh, it didn't hurt you as bad.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.880]   That outcome might be there, but we might miss it if we're thinking that both of us
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.440]   have to suffer a little bit of discomfort along the way.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.720]   So I think it's really important for us to get very clear on what we want and why
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.280]   and what they want and why, and then figure out what path gets us there faster.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.320]   So it's kind of like the difference between strategic thinking and tactical
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.840]   thinking.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.360]   So is negotiating more strategic or tactical or kind of both?
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.640]   It's got to be both.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.120]   So I need to have my goal and then I need to reason backwards to figure out what my
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.680]   overall strategy will be.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.480]   And then when it comes to the actual X's and O's during the negotiation, at the
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.960]   negotiation table, while I'm talking to you, those are the tactics.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.360]   And so once I get clarity on my goal and then my strategy, then I can kind of
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.560]   cherry pick to see which tactics work.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.320]   But one tactic might be powerful in general, but not powerful in this
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.120]   particular circumstance, just because it doesn't meet our strategic goal, too.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.080]   So you always have to have the big picture in mind to make sure that you're
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   picking the right tactic.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.160]   Okay.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.600]   So I want to talk about the tactics.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.120]   I also want to, you mentioned the negotiating process.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.640]   I'm curious about your process, but before that, I just want to understand how did
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.840]   you end up being the negotiation guy, right?
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.240]   The top-ranked negotiating podcast, like this is your thing.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.400]   How did that come about?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.680]   Yeah, as you could probably assume, it was pretty weird.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.360]   You know, this is not what little kids grow up and say, "I want to be."
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.840]   And so for me, my undergrad degree is in psychology.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.600]   So I went to Ohio State University, a master's, undergrad degree in
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.000]   psychology, and then minors in foundation of law and Spanish.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.160]   I wanted to be a therapist originally, and just because I was a people pleaser.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.480]   And so I had to get over that social phobia.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.960]   And so I wanted to empower people.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.360]   And so then I said, you know what, if I want to empower people and help people,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.080]   I could be, I could do that more efficiently by getting into politics.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.040]   And so Chris, this is where I started to get astray.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.800]   And so that's where I went to law school, did law school and got my master's of
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.200]   public policy in three years at Ohio State.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.280]   And so during that process, I started to learn more about politics and Chris, you
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.880]   might find this surprising, but I realized that would be an undesirable lifestyle.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.680]   I didn't want that for my family.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.880]   They deserve better than that.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.920]   And so I was that guy getting sworn in after passing the bar, asking himself
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.320]   what he wants to be when he grows up.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.840]   And so for me, I did some civil rights work, leaning on that public policy
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.160]   degree, health equity, to be more precise.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.560]   And then I always had an entrepreneurial bug.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.040]   So I started my own practice and built that up for a while.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   But I knew that I wanted to discover more about these difficult conversations
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.600]   because I had a class in law school and it was a negotiation class.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.040]   It was the first time I ever took that class or heard about the topic.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   And I fell in love because it was the first time I saw psychology used for a
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.640]   business or legal purpose just so clearly.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.320]   And so we had a negotiation competition and my partner and I won the competition
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.520]   at Ohio State that allowed us to represent the school at regionals in Ottawa, Ontario.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.200]   We won that competition as well.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.040]   That was with the American Bar Association.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.840]   And then we made it to the semi-finals of the national competition.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.960]   So I was like, I like this negotiation thing.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.080]   Let's, let's figure this out.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.840]   Because like I said, as a recovering people pleaser, it was the first time I
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.320]   really fully appreciated that this was a skill more so than a talent.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.440]   I can learn how to do better at this.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.640]   And so I said, there are probably other people who are struggling with the same
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.240]   skill, let's figure this out.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.120]   How can I help to empower more people?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.360]   So my whole professional career was figuring out how I can get back to
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.000]   negotiation and how I could make a career out of it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.680]   And so that's what led me to the American Negotiation Institute, because the goal
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.440]   is to help people learn this skill.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.840]   And that's why you see me doing it at scale.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   So most other people in the negotiation consulting world, they target their
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.440]   clients and that's pretty much it.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.200]   But our goal, we pride ourselves in putting out as much free content as possible.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.320]   So we have the podcast, my show coming out five days a week.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.560]   We have ask with confidence, which is all about women in negotiation and leadership.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.880]   That comes out weekly.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.000]   And now we have a new podcast that's weekly.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.200]   It's in Spanish.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.840]   It's the only Spanish language negotiation podcast called negociacion desde cero.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.920]   And that started on our network of podcasts about three weeks ago.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.480]   So it's exciting.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.280]   It's, it's fun.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.600]   And my team hates when I say this, but you know, it's the free work that really gets
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.560]   me excited when I get messages on LinkedIn from people talking about how they change
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.960]   their lives with what we, what they've learned through our content.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.480]   That's great.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.280]   And then of course the negotiation training and the negotiation consulting pays the
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.680]   bills.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   And you said that, you know, this isn't what every kid wants to grow up doing, but
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.200]   if you look back at your childhood, can you see glimpses of young negotiating Kwame
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.720]   trying to get things done that make you realize that maybe this was a path you were
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.600]   destined to take?
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.720]   You definitely can see that because I was always the peacemaker.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.240]   I always tried to bring people together to reconcile, help people to reconcile their
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.560]   differences and things like that.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.720]   And so I can definitely see that mentality coming out in different ways during
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.240]   childhood.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.840]   And I've also been, I've always been curious about people in general, humanity.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.040]   I find that humans are the most interesting animals on the planet.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.520]   So I like to learn as much as I can.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.680]   And so that, that is what keeps on pulling me back to psychology.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.880]   And that's really been helpful because it helps me to understand things, but also as
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.320]   I'm teaching other people, it helps them to understand not just what works, but
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.760]   actually why it works.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.040]   And it's funny, I think I've come from negotiating from a perspective of, you
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.560]   know, it's about getting the deal and a lot of savings and that's kind of the thing
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.400]   that's driven me.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.880]   But it sounds like there's a process that you take when you think about negotiating,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.320]   whether it's business or work or pleasure or anything.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.960]   What is that process?
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.720]   So there's a framework that we use that we, we call the compassionate curiosity
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.240]   framework, and it can be used in any difficult conversation, whether it's at
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.000]   work or at home.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.120]   And so it helps, especially with the highly emotional conversations that will
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.600]   come up.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.000]   Because the thing is, Chris, a lot of times with these negotiations, you have these
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.560]   really high level strategies that you want to use, these insightful things, your
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.240]   ration and your logic, you want to pull it and put all that together.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.960]   But a lot of times we don't even get the person to a place where they can
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.160]   psychologically appreciate what it is that we're saying, because we've done such a
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.000]   poor job of managing the emotions.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.720]   And so that's why we wanted to focus on the compassionate curiosity framework as
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.320]   our marquee contribution to the industry.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.680]   And so it's a simple three-step process, helps you know what to say and when to say
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.040]   it for maximum impact.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.760]   So step one is acknowledge and validate emotions.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.160]   Step two, get curious with compassion.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.120]   And step three is joint problem solving.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.440]   And so you can cycle through it based on what you see.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.000]   And so it helps to alleviate that emotional distress at the beginning so
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.880]   people can operate on a higher level.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.280]   And then it helps you to gather information, but doing it with a
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.760]   compassionate tone so people don't get afraid and they don't want to be
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.160]   forthright and share the information.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.600]   Then last step is just working with the other side to figure out what works.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   And is there an example you could walk through to kind of bring it to life?
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.640]   So the reason I still practice is because I want, it's story collection,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.360]   Chris, for moments like these.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.680]   So I was in this negotiation representing a company, it was a
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.200]   manufacturing type of situation, multiple six figures on the line and the
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.800]   relationship between my client and the manufacturer had frayed significantly.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.600]   And it got to the point where the CEOs of the respective companies were sending
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.160]   offensive emails back and forth.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   So I'm like, well, you know, this sounds pretty bad.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.120]   And so, you know, going into that conversation, obviously we understood
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.440]   that there was a high level of emotionality on both sides.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.280]   Not only was there a lot of money at issue, but they were personally
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.000]   insulted through the process.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.840]   And so the funny thing is, the really funny thing is I went into that and of
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.000]   course I prepared, but I knew that the core approach was going to be addressing
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.960]   that emotional side.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Then I had my tactics that I would use down the road, but I was like, this is
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.680]   going to be my foundation, the compassionate curiosity framework.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.480]   And then throughout this whole one hour negotiation, I used one tool, Chris.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.120]   Just this, that's it.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.640]   And everything was fine.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   And so what we did first, I had to coach my client.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.440]   I was like, listen, when things get hot, just let me handle this.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.240]   I know you're mad.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.440]   Let me absorb this for you.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.760]   Because if that person were to get upset and jump in, then
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.040]   everything is kind of lost here.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.080]   And so I just started off by asking, how did we get here?
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.640]   What are you experiencing on your side?
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.680]   And so they would say their piece, everything was good.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.040]   Talking to the engineer first, they were very level headed.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.920]   And so there was no emotionality.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.000]   So when there's no emotion, then you just skip to step two, which is
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.240]   getting curious with compassion.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.760]   So I was just asking a lot of open-ended questions, summarizing, demonstrating
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.480]   my understanding, asking more questions.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.840]   And so the fuller picture started to appear.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.600]   So not only were these people not evil.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.640]   Not only were they not negligent, but they were actually, they were actually
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.960]   going out of their way to perform above and beyond the contract.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.880]   They just didn't do a good job of communicating down the line.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.080]   They were communicating with our person's project manager, but not the CEO.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.120]   So it was like a game of telephone.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.000]   And then, so everything's going well.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.040]   So I say, okay, great.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040]   We're just going to ask questions.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.760]   Then we'll cycle into joint problem solving.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.960]   This is, this is kind of smooth.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.880]   Then their CEO started talking.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.320]   He was pissed.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.040]   Cause he's like, okay, this was like 20 minutes in Chris.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.280]   And then he says, I have to address these emails and he printed them out
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.360]   and he was reading verbatim.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.600]   And so he was going on and getting, he started to rant.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.800]   And so that's an opportunity rationally.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.840]   What do you want to do is you emotionally will be drawn towards like counteracting
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.120]   every point that they make.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.400]   I'm going to counter that point.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.120]   That's wrong.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.000]   I'm going to contest that.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.880]   I'm going to contest that.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.760]   But here's what you do with the framework.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.960]   You don't pay attention as much to the specificity of what they're saying.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.880]   Of course you do because you respect the person, but that's not the core.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.760]   You listen more for the emotions.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.360]   What are the emotions behind that?
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.240]   I'm going to respond to the emotions rather than the specifics of
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.200]   what this person is saying.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.760]   And so what I did is I took notes and I listened to this rant for about five
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.480]   minutes and as he's ranting, I'm texting my client, I'm saying, don't say anything.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.360]   Don't say anything.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.200]   Let me handle this.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.120]   And so all I did in response to that rant is I summarized everything.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.600]   And then I just said, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like with the
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.000]   emails that you received, it sounds like you were pretty offended by that.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.960]   So when you're acknowledging and validating the emotions, you're
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.840]   giving an emotional label.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.440]   And so they'll either accept or reject it.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.240]   And there's a whole psychology behind that.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.040]   And so his response was, well, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say offended, but I would
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.760]   say just a little bit disheartened and frustrated with the situation.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.640]   So even if you're wrong, they'll correct you, which labels the emotion.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.040]   And so then he started to explain a little bit more.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.880]   You start to see the level of emotionality go down.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.840]   So what you do is you stay in this role of acknowledging and validating emotions.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.160]   So you summarize and then say it sounds like, or it seems like, and
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.400]   then they start to calm down.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.120]   And I didn't transition into something more substantive until I recognized
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.560]   that emotionality was going down.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.840]   And then I got asked some more questions.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.920]   Then we transitioned into problem solving and it was really easy.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:32.800]   And I ended the call by saying, I have a sense, I have a sense of humor.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.360]   Listen, don't use humor in negotiations if you're not funny.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.480]   But thankfully the market has responded favorably to me in the past.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.320]   And so I, we were ended, we ended up and everything was, was good.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.640]   And I said, and before we go, gentlemen, I just wanted you to know this.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.520]   I am frankly very disappointed in the way that this call went.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.800]   I was expecting a lot more emotion and more insults and you
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.280]   all were just way too reasonable.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   So everybody got a good laugh, but really that's it.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.800]   But there were so many opportunities there, Chris, to do it the wrong way.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.680]   To start going tit for tat on the insults when he started to rehash.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.240]   Right.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.520]   And a lot of times what we have to do is we have to recognize these little
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.440]   inflection points in these conversations where you could go one way or the other
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.360]   way, you can keep it productive, or you could try to make it a right
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.440]   versus wrong type of thing.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.000]   And so that's a really powerful example of how, even though this is a situation
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.680]   about money, very clearly about dollars and cents, very business oriented.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.120]   So just simply cycling through that framework was the right answer because
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:40.040]   what was manifesting itself as a substantive issue was really largely emotional.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.440]   That's amazing.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.040]   I feel like I've been in similar situations, both personal and work, and I
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.080]   haven't had a Kwame on my side to say, "Hey, be quiet.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.400]   Let me ask questions."
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.000]   Are there tactics you would recommend for people who don't have a master
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.880]   negotiator sitting at their side to kind of do to prepare to make sure that they
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.200]   kind of get the same outcome?
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.400]   Yes, Chris.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.680]   And I love the word that you said.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.240]   Preparation is my love language.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.040]   So if you go to our website, americannegotiationinstitute.com/guide, you
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.640]   can get access to all of our free negotiation guides that help you prepare
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.200]   systematically. And so a lot of times, still today, there are times where I
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.400]   don't feel comfortable, where I still feel a bit afraid or nervous before a
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.680]   conversation. Usually that's because of a lack of preparation.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.080]   And so it gives me a systematic way to prepare beforehand.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.200]   So that's number one.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.800]   The other thing that I think people don't realize is powerful is proper role
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.960]   playing. And I say proper because there's some ways to level it up.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.680]   So first way, you want to role play twice.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.160]   So first, you want to role play as the person that you're going to talk to,
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.040]   right? So it's like, who am I going to talk to?
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.880]   I'm not going to role play as myself.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.360]   I'm going to role play playing their role.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.960]   And so it leads to higher levels of empathy because you'll start hearing
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.200]   yourself making arguments and rationalizations that you never thought of
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.000]   before when you're forced to play their role.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.280]   And so it helps you to be a lot more prepared and it helps you to empathize
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.960]   because a lot of times we just go in and we're like, this person is evil or
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.760]   crazy. Like we just vilify them and write them off.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.400]   But when you're playing their role,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.720]   it forces you to find validity and legitimacy in what it is that they're
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.360]   saying. And usually it's there,
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.080]   but our emotions make it difficult for us to find it.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.600]   So role playing as the other side is the best way to do it.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.440]   Then you role play as yourself, do a second session.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.480]   And so what you tell your partner is this,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.840]   you tell them exactly what you're afraid of. What is your biggest fear?
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.680]   Is this person highly emotional? What kind of emotions?
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.480]   Or do I need to prepare for tears or do I need to prepare for aggression?
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.720]   So you tell the other side exactly what your biggest fears are and say, listen,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.400]   if they are at a five out of 10,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.320]   I need you in this role play to pretend that you are a 20 out of 10.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.920]   I want you to take this to a level where it would be unrealistic that somebody
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.960]   could behave this badly.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.280]   And so then whenever you actually have the actual negotiation,
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.080]   whatever ridiculous thing the person says or does,
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.840]   you're completely prepared because you're like, man,
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.960]   I role played with Chris and he was awful to me. You know?
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.240]   So you're ready for what life has to offer you in that actual conversation.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.640]   What about when you don't have time to prepare?
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.680]   I find that I guess business negotiations, you often, you know,
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.560]   you know, when they're coming sometimes at home,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.400]   relationship negotiations or conflicts,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.280]   they don't always come with preparation time,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.920]   but you can get into a conversation and that leads to something and you don't
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.400]   have time to prepare. Is there,
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.280]   is there anything you like to do in the moment if you haven't prepared to make
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.880]   it a more successful conversation or negotiation?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.040]   So let me start off with a disclaimer that I always get my guests to
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.120]   say inadvertently, but it happens.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.880]   I am much better at doing this in the business world than I am in my personal
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.400]   life. Because when emotions are tighter, it's like, man,
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.280]   I look at my performance afterwards. I say, have I ever had a conversation before?
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.040]   Chris? I don't know. You know, it's, it's weird. And so all of my guests,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.760]   they say, Oh yeah, I'm much better in the real world than I am at home.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.800]   So let's just say that.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.760]   So I think that's something that we have to recognize.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.000]   And there are a few reasons why. So number one,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.320]   most of the time when we're having conversations at home,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.240]   like let's say with a significant other, it's after a long day of work.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.720]   So you are already tired.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.760]   And when you're tired, that makes it more likely for your natural tendencies to
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.040]   flow. Because for instance, if you have a diet, if you're well rested, Hey,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.520]   you know, I can stay on that diet. But if I'm super tired,
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.480]   it's much easier for me to smash on some junk food because I don't have that
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.880]   discipline, that mental discipline.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.800]   So that's one of the many reasons why it's harder at home.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.040]   And so you have to create some time either pause and just say, Hey,
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.520]   I'm not prepared to have this conversation right now.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.520]   Would you mind if we have it at a specific time? You can just say,
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.840]   it might be five minutes,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.440]   but just be honest with yourself and with the other person.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.440]   If they're really pushing you, then what I suggest is do this.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.160]   If we're using the language of the compassionate curiosity,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.040]   just stay in step one and step two.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.280]   I'm not going to try to problem solve right now.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.680]   All I'm doing is I'm going to acknowledge and validate your emotions.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   And I'm going to get curious with compassion and ask questions so you can
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.000]   express yourself. I'm going to focus on completely on you.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.600]   If I'm speaking less, it's less likely for me to make a mistake.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.000]   So that's all I'm going to do in this interaction right now.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.120]   And then let's say in the business world, we're very busy.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.120]   We are very, very busy. And it's tough to get that time to prepare.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.080]   Cause I would tell people, Hey, you know, take an hour or two or prepare it.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.480]   They say, where am I supposed to find that? Okay.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.320]   So I call this the three minute prep. Okay.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.160]   And so sometimes a call's coming up. I didn't have time to prep. That's okay.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.640]   This is how you can do it in three minutes. First, ask yourself,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.520]   what do I want and why figure that out, write that down,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.560]   then ask yourself, what do they want and why? And so use your best guess.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.760]   You want to verify that during the conversation. And then you ask yourself,
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.280]   what are all of the open-ended questions that I could possibly ask in this
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.880]   conversation? So you want to try to get at least three.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.240]   So it's what do I want and why, what do they want and why?
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.160]   And then as many open-ended questions as you get, you know,
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.520]   and you can do that in one to three minutes and just doing that alone,
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.480]   we'll put you in a better mindset and help you to be more prepared for your
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.320]   conversation.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:41.000]   And why open-ended questions and what are some examples of great open-ended
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.760]   questions?
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.720]   Yes. So open-ended questions give you a narrative response.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.920]   It's an information game.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.680]   Knowledge is power and power in negotiation is leverage.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.640]   You don't want to just give it all away,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.480]   but you also want to collect as much as you can in preparation beforehand.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.200]   And during the conversation, because I think especially us raised with the
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.520]   internet, it's, it's easy for us to become a little bit,
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.040]   too overconfident in how much we know, because we can just Google so much,
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.840]   but the reality is a lot of the most pertinent information is only found within
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.160]   the confines of their mind. They need to share it with you.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.760]   And a lot of times they won't do that without proper prompting.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.160]   And so you want to ask open-ended questions because it creates that narrative
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.440]   response and leads to a lot more explanation.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.840]   And so I want people to explain,
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.920]   I want them to expand and share what they're thinking in with as many words as
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.440]   it takes for them to get there. When it comes to some of my favorite questions,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.080]   especially in transactional negotiations,
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.920]   this is one of the most powerful questions that you could ask.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.400]   And especially Chris,
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.880]   given some of the hacks that you've told me about where it comes to saving money,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.960]   you would love this question too. It's simply what flexibility do you have?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.440]   What flexibility do you have?
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.400]   So think about it as just like in a marketplace type of scenario,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.480]   or you're at a hotel trying to negotiate an upgrade or whatever.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.000]   Just ask what flexibility do you have? Because number one, it's open-ended.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.760]   So they have to elaborate. Number two,
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.720]   it has the assumption that there is flexibility. We're saying, Hey,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.760]   I know you have flexibility. You know, you have flexibility. Just what is it?
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.800]   What does it look like? Right? And, and so it's non-threatening as well,
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.280]   because it's not an aggressive type of statement that puts people on the
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.920]   defensive, just very conversational and open.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.280]   So that's one of my favorite questions.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.240]   And then the other ones don't actually end in question marks.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.280]   So tell me more about this or help me to understand that those types of things
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.080]   are other great sentence formulations for a lot of information.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.560]   It seems like with every business,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.840]   you get to a certain size and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.960]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.240]   manual processes. And there's no one source of truth. If this is you,
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   you should know these three numbers, 37,025,
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.560]   one 37,000.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.080]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.480]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.560]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining, accounting,
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   financial management, inventory, HR, and more 25.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.680]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.520]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less close their books in
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.280]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.840]   And one because your business is one of a kind.

[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:12.640]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.040]   good for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.080]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.960]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.040]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.760]   250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.480]   theraflavins and catechins.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.120]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.600]   heavy minerals and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.080]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.760]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.040]   so travel friendly. They have so many products,
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.120]   but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh for mental clarity and
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.080]   energy and the black Pu-erh which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.400]   a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite things to
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   drink. And if you need another reason,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.320]   search for all the amazing research backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.760]   microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.800]   and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.040]   other teas in the world.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.000]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.400]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money backed guarantee.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.000]   And for a limited time,

[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.560]   So it sounds like if you ask a lot of open-ended questions,
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.560]   you're not doing a lot of talking yourself. Is that the goal?
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.160]   Is there a target percentage for how much you want to be talking versus the
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.400]   other person? And is there any data behind why you'd want to do this?
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.920]   Yes and yes. So my, I call it the 70/30 rule.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.760]   So I try to speak only 30% of the time and get the other person talking 70% of
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.200]   the time. In my casual conversations,
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.920]   I use it as practice and I try to see how extreme I can get that ratio.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:19.320]   Can I get it 90/10, 80/20? Let's see. Cause every, every conversation is practice.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.800]   I want to do well in these little conversations.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.200]   So the big ones really matter. So I'm ready. And so the science behind this,
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.760]   a book reference is The Code of Trust by Robin Dreek,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.080]   former FBI agent, and his job was to flip spies.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.440]   And so one of the things he talked about was with studies,
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.640]   the more you let people talk,
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.920]   especially if you let them talk about things that they enjoy,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.880]   it creates a lot of dopamine in their system.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.000]   And they'll associate that positivity with you.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.480]   That's what ends up creating more trust. So it becomes self-fulfilling.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.360]   So you get, let them talk. They feel better about themselves.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.280]   They feel understood and they start to like you more during the process.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.840]   The more that they like you and trust you during the process,
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.600]   the more vulnerable they will be and more vulnerability leads to more
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.400]   information as well. And so there, there is a lot of science behind it.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.840]   The more they talk, the better they feel.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.160]   Wow. Now it sounds like you could use this for bad.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.480]   Is there something you keep in the back of your mind to try to make sure,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.520]   you know, as you said earlier, a negotiation isn't just about winning?
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.320]   Yeah. And so I have, I have to redefine winning.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.600]   That's really what it is because winning has to deal with the outcome for sure.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.440]   That's a part of it.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.600]   But I think you can win every single difficult conversation if you think about
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.440]   it in this way.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.560]   So goal number one is to put myself in the best position for success.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.960]   So what is it that I need to do or say to put myself in the best position?
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.560]   I'm going to do the best that I can't, can't win them all. You know,
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.120]   I can't guarantee that somebody is going to respond the right way.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.800]   I can't guarantee that the numbers work out,
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   but I can guarantee that I can choose the right tools at the right time based on
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.480]   proper information. I can do the best that I can.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.720]   Then the second thing is if I'm improving during the process,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.000]   because sometimes we might be tempted to take some shortcuts,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.480]   like people might be tempted to lie in the process or something like that,
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.400]   but is that improving your skills? No, it's not.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.400]   And so I think about every conversation is practice.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.560]   So if I'm putting myself in the best position for success and I'm improving my
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.160]   skills in the process that I'm winning.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.600]   And so especially as a competitive person,
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.000]   I really had to divorce myself from the outcome and marry myself to the process.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.560]   That's really what it comes down to.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.280]   And if you become like too focused on the outcome,
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.000]   then it can lead you astray. And then to your point about in the wrong hands,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   it could be used for evil. You are 100% right.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.880]   And that's why I tell people persuasion is just a tool.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.960]   It depends on how you use it because persuasion and manipulation are the same
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.160]   thing, but it comes down to intent.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.480]   And so what I did in my research is I figured out that all of your
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.440]   thousands of listeners, I know that they're all good people.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.240]   So I feel comfortable sharing these skills because your people use it for good,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.080]   not evil.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.960]   Okay.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.600]   So that means everyone listening needs to make Kwame proud and use this only for
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.440]   good things like free upgrades and big discounts.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.720]   So one other tactic I'd love your take on,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.200]   should you always be making the first offer in a negotiation?
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.560]   Yeah. So you will hear a lot of people say, always make the first offer.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.400]   And then you'll hear other people say, never make the first offer.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.200]   And I will say, never listen to absolutes. Okay.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.400]   You know, I'm a lawyer. So it depends. And it depends on this one thing.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.480]   So if you have as much information or more
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.520]   information than the other side, then you make the first offer.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.480]   If you have less information,
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.440]   then you let them make the first offer and then counter because every offer has
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.880]   to be substantiated by information. And that's how you learn.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.160]   And so one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that anchoring is a
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.000]   legitimate and powering tool.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.160]   And so the way that I describe it is anchoring is the most aggressive request
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.920]   that you can legitimately justify.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.000]   There's a lot of science behind why there is first mover advantage in
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.320]   negotiation, because it sets the reference point for the conversation.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.520]   Lots of fun studies on that too,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.840]   but just know that there is a strategic advantage to making a competent first
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.000]   offer. So if you have that information, then drop that anchor,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   make that first offer.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.760]   But it is too risky if you don't know as much as the other side,
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.440]   it's kind of like a job offer type of negotiation where they say, Hey,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.280]   Chris, we like you.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.960]   What will it take for us to bring on the team? And you're like, all right,
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.000]   you know, if you could pay me $200,000, I think that'd be great.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.400]   And they're like, yeah, absolutely. We can do that. Feel dumb.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.800]   You say, what could I have asked for? I was clearly in the wrong range,
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.520]   you know? So that's the mentality behind it.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.080]   And if you don't have enough information to make that competent first offer,
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.440]   and someone comes back to you with something that you think is crazy,
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.680]   how do you react?
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.520]   So there are a couple of things. So with the initial reaction,
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:09.600]   you have to make sure that you make it clear that this is not in
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.000]   the range of possibility. So you have to set that expectation,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.040]   because a lot of times people will throw out an anchor and they would try to
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.200]   read your body language, see how you're responding to it. Okay. Hey, you know,
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.160]   they didn't like it, but they didn't fall out of the chair.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.320]   So I guess I'm in the range. Let's, let's keep on hammering home this anchor.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.240]   And so what you want to do is you want to express clearly, Hey,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.040]   this is not in the range, but I think if we have a conversation,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.480]   we could try to figure out a way to bridge this gap. And so for me,
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.360]   with an anchor that is outside the range of possibility,
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.840]   I'm almost going to act like it never happened. And here's why,
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.840]   because there's significant psychological consequences because of the science of
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.680]   anchoring, it sets that reference point. And the more you talk about the anchor,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.360]   the more legitimate it becomes,
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.120]   the more concrete and crystallized it becomes in the minds of everybody around.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.520]   So that's why when I'm telling people and teaching them how to make an offer and
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.360]   using the anchoring technique,
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.240]   I tell them that you want to be creative about saying that anchor over and over
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.840]   and over again, because they're becoming more and more comfortable with it.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.360]   The more times you talk about it. So when they're on the receiving end,
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.480]   I'm like, we need to pretend like that never even happened. Right.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.600]   And one of the strategic mistakes that people make is that when somebody
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.040]   gives them an anchor that is aggressive, they try to attack the anchor directly,
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.680]   which is the common sense thing to do. Hey, that was preposterous.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.960]   I need to attack it and let you know that that will not fly right now.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.680]   Here's why that is problematic because it creates a scenario called psychological
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   entrenchment. This was explored the best by Deepak Malhotra in the book,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.520]   Negotiation Genius.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.400]   So what ends up happening is that when you attack an anchor or an offer directly
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.280]   too forcefully,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.360]   what ends up happening is the other person in order to save their dignity,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.760]   they have to defend themselves and the anchor.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.080]   And so what you're doing is you're forcing them to create arguments for why
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   that anchor is legitimate because you're telling them that it is illegitimate.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   So you want to shift the conversation away from the specifics of that anchor and
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.440]   instead try to figure out the rationale behind it.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.120]   What problem are they trying to solve with that anchor? Okay.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.240]   So I'm going to try to find a different way to solve those problems that is not
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.080]   so threatening or damaging to my business.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.360]   Yeah. We recently purchased a home.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   And when you're negotiating the price of a home,
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.360]   it's maybe one of the bigger personal negotiations people are doing.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:43.600]   And sometimes you might think that that first anchor is about money,
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.200]   but in reality we learned by asking the real estate agent what was really
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.560]   important to the, to the client that no,
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.120]   actually the most important thing was about finding a good family and closing
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.880]   quickly. So it's like, Oh, okay, now we know what's really important.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.120]   And so instead of saying the price is wrong, we said, Hey,
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.400]   here's what we can do focused on the things that were important to them.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.920]   And then let the price be secondary.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.800]   And it ended up being a little bit more favorable outcome because we were willing
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.320]   to move quickly. And so sometimes you can ask directly.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.760]   Sometimes if you're dealing with a middle party, like a real estate agent,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.000]   you could just ask and say, Hey,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.880]   what's really important to the seller or the buyer?
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.600]   Do they want to close the deal quickly?
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.520]   Do they want to make the most amount of money?
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.960]   Are they looking for lower risk, like no contingencies?
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.880]   Do they just want to sell it to a family that'll treat the home right?
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.680]   In which case you should probably write a letter.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.520]   I tend to say the letter is free. So even if you don't know if they care,
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.680]   just write the letter. Yeah.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.960]   So that's a personal example where what I thought was important in the anchor was
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.120]   the price. And it turns out it was important of course,
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.960]   but it wasn't the most important thing.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.400]   Exactly. Yep. And that's the thing, our assumptions will often lead us astray.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.120]   So that's why it's good. Like you did in that example,
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.880]   you treat it not as an assumption,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.160]   but more a hypothesis where you go in there saying it's likely to be true,
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.360]   but I'm going to still test it during this conversation by still staying
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.200]   curious.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.040]   Yep. And when do you walk away from a negotiation?
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.160]   So walking away is an art and a science. So we'll,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.640]   we'll talk about when and how,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.280]   so when it depends on how much you need the deal.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.200]   And it also depends on how much time you have to close the deal,
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.080]   because there's some times where I say, you know,
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.160]   if I invested about a couple more months,
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   I think I could get this across the finish line. But the question is,
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.520]   do I want to invest a couple of more months?
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.000]   Because there's an opportunity cost when I'm spending my time doing this.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   And so you have to have in your mind, a certain kind of a shot clock saying,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.800]   how many meetings and whatnot will I go through before calling this off?
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.040]   And depending on the situation, you want to let them know I'm doing a mediation
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.120]   between two business partners, trying to negotiate a business divorce.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.240]   So I told them, Hey, we'll do these one hour long sessions.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.160]   I'll talk to you each individually. We'll do about two, two or three rounds.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.720]   And then at that point, if we haven't gotten to an agreement,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.600]   I'm going to be a little bit more aggressive with how much I push you.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.640]   And if it still doesn't work, then we'll call it.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.320]   So sometimes it's appropriate to let people know what your stopping point is.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.800]   But oftentimes strategically,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.080]   it doesn't make as much sense because that might be a significant tell you have
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.640]   to determine based on the situation.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.320]   But I think it's important to recognize that depending on your alternatives,
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.600]   that might be the best option because sometimes the worst outcome is a deal that
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.800]   should have never happened.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.600]   So walking away always needs to be a viable option for everybody at the table.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.080]   Now, when it comes to how to do it,
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.840]   you don't just want to throw your hands up, walk away.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.760]   And then I say, I'm never coming back. Here's what I say,
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.560]   based on the way that the circumstances are right now,
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.720]   this isn't a deal that couldn't work for us. But I want to say to you,
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.840]   if anything changes on your end, Chris, let us know.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.560]   And we would be more than happy to continue the conversation.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   And similarly, if anything changes on our end, we'll do the same.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.600]   So that way,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.640]   if the other side was bluffing and they didn't think you were going to walk away.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.880]   Now you did now they don't look like losers coming back to the table.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.160]   I gave them an out. They can just say, Oh man,
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.400]   I talked to my CFO and she told me that we could do X, Y, Z now. Yep. Cool.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.520]   All right. Now we're back to it.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.240]   So they can come back without losing their dignity and respect.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.600]   They don't lose face. And similarly,
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.360]   I can do the same because things may have legitimately changed in a couple of
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.400]   weeks. And then I could revisit the conversation too.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.720]   That's amazing. I feel like I just want to go start negotiating something.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.040]   Are there, are there things you think people don't negotiate, but should?
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.000]   Yeah. The bigger the dollar amount, the more there is to negotiate.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   I remember in law school, I was bored and clearly I just wanted to win.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.320]   I negotiated a $7 lamp on, on, uh,
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.480]   on Craigslist and got it down to five, you know? Okay.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.000]   So that was dumb practice, but it worked.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.240]   But sometimes there are things that we just take for granted.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.000]   And so now I mentor kids who are going into law school and I tell them,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.720]   you can negotiate your scholarship package.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.920]   100% of the kids that negotiate their scholarship package, get a better deal.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.600]   100%. And they, all they do is they send an email.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.280]   So anybody listening and you want to negotiate your scholarship package,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.440]   especially to law school, this is what you do. So you say, Hey,
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.040]   I appreciate the scholarship offer and admission, uh, as you know,
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.520]   finances are going to be a major decision for us.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.440]   And we've received a lot of different offers. And with that,
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.840]   I'm wondering what flexibility do you have on your scholarship offer?
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.560]   And most of the time people, they'll come back and say, yeah,
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.200]   we can give you an extra 5k per year. They just have it.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   They just have it. And so that's why asking that simple question,
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.680]   what flexibility that do you have? It is it's magical.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.360]   Okay. So scholarships,
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.240]   are there any other things that people might miss out on the opportunity to
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.800]   negotiate that you've seen success with?
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.120]   Yeah. So we have scholarships of cars are a big one.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.200]   We have a car negotiation guide, FYI,
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.400]   for people who might be buying their next car.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.960]   You can go through that guide and prep.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:04.120]   I think the biggest ones that people miss are the everyday negotiations with
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   family and friends.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:10.320]   And so the definition that we use for negotiation is anytime you're in a
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.720]   conversation and somebody in the conversation wants something.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.360]   And so with that definition, you're negotiating all the time, right?
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.400]   And so for instance, with childcare, with my wife,
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.520]   she wanted to have another kid. I said, kids are disruptive.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.680]   We need to talk about this, figure out what, what are these,
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.080]   what are these lines going to be?
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:34.120]   And so for me with what I do when I'm consulting on deals or doing negotiation
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.280]   trainings or conflict resolution trainings,
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.360]   I have to get on the plane and travel. And so I said, listen,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.000]   I need to be able to travel at this,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.480]   at least this many times per month in order for my business to be in a good
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   spot. And so in order for us to do that,
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.920]   we need to figure out what childcare looks like for that to not be untenable
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.120]   for you. And so instead of just saying, Hey Kwame,
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.720]   do you want to have another kid? You're outvoted your mom, your dad,
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.400]   my mom and our son, one another kid. So you do want another one? I'm like, ah,
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.000]   fine. Okay. We'll do it. You know, that's not a negotiation.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.680]   We can stop and say, listen, we can do this,
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.080]   but we have to have a conversation about these types of things.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.520]   And so I don't think enough people recognize that these conversations are not
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.560]   just yes or no.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.560]   There's a lot more substance that can be gained through these interactions.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.800]   So we've talked about a lot of ways that people can improve their skills.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.720]   Are there any other common mistakes you see people make when they're negotiating?
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.960]   I think one thing that people miss is the fact that they don't
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.800]   understand the difference between what somebody says that's emotional
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.480]   versus what they really mean. So for instance, if you're really upset,
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.800]   there's a difference between facts and feelings,
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.520]   but they feel the same at the same time. Right?
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.880]   And so I might say something very emotionally that is factually
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.880]   incorrect, but it feels right at that moment.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.960]   And so a lot of times people will contend with that and try to chop it down.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.200]   And they would just attack that thing. And then they start to dig their healing.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.080]   They start to fight back and they start to fight back.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.640]   Not because it's incorrect, but on principle. Right?
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.560]   And so I think it's important to recognize that we often invite the responses
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.440]   that we want to see the most by our own responses.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.640]   And so that's where the framework comes in handy because your response to the
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.920]   emotions, not the facts.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.120]   And so the people are able to let go because their ego doesn't get wrapped up in
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.520]   it as much because they don't feel as threatened.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.120]   But if you make them feel safer emotionally through the process,
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.760]   then they don't feel as though they need to cling on to these ideas so tightly.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.160]   So earlier, you talked about your family and your children.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.720]   What about negotiating with kids?
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.040]   Well, here's the thing, Chris, the simpler you keep it, the easier it is.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:51.800]   And so I use the framework with my family all the time when I'm on my game,
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.840]   when I'm on my game, I do.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.640]   That's why it's so good to practice with them because you're usually tired and
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.280]   you're not wanting to do it the right way.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.040]   And so I want to focus on that conversational habit.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.680]   So with Kai, you know, he's five, five-year-old kids don't want to go to bed.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.720]   They never do.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.400]   And so sometimes he'll fight and doesn't want to go to bed.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.040]   And so I'll just use the framework.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.880]   So I would say, Kai, it's, it sounds like you don't want to go to bed right now.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.640]   No, I don't want to go to bed. Okay. That makes sense.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.600]   Can you tell me a bit more about that? And he says, no,
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.920]   I don't want to go to bed right now.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.960]   I want to stay up and I want to cuddle with you and mommy on the couch and watch
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:32.120]   TV until it gets later until you all go to bed. Oh, okay.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.960]   So it sounds like the reason you don't want to go to bed is because you want to
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:39.360]   spend time with me and mommy. Is that right? Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.440]   And we like spending time with you. And so he started to calm down.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.320]   Now I cycle to the next thing. So what is it about going to bed?
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.880]   That's important. He said, well, I have to go to bed so I can get smart. Okay.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   What else, what else is good about getting sleep? He said, well,
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.400]   if I go to sleep, then I could grow up and be big and strong. Like, like you,
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.600]   I said, okay. So what do you think we should do right now?
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.640]   Uh, I think I, I should probably go to sleep. Okay. Sounds good. Kai.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.320]   I'll see you later. Yeah. And you know, it doesn't work every time,
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.360]   but it's all about improving your winning percentage.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.080]   And I think it's especially powerful with children too,
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.120]   because the way I think about parenting is that I'm parenting towards
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.400]   obsolescence. And what I mean by that is at some point I need to become obsolete.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:27.000]   I need to teach him how to become a free thinker and come to conclusions by
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.720]   themselves. And when you think about the psychology of self-esteem,
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   self-worth and confidence, things like that,
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.200]   oftentimes they say that you as the parent,
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.440]   your voice in many ways becomes their internal monologue.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   And so I don't want it to be the judgmental father who's just
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.640]   telling people what to do as a dictator.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.320]   I want it to be that compassionately curious.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.680]   You see I'm on brand with compassionate curiosity.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.520]   I want it to be a compassionately curious voice.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.000]   That's asking questions that helps him to come to the right conclusion himself.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.560]   I'm teaching him how to make good decisions through that process too.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:06.400]   So it's good practice for me to make sure that I keep my skills sharp and
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.000]   really good thinking practice for him.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.920]   So he can feel as though he's in control because ultimately I want him to
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.720]   make the right decision. I don't want him to do what I want to do.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.240]   What I want him to do simply because he was forced.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.640]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:28.800]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.080]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.680]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.760]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.200]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.360]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.720]   So you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.560]   the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.760]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade,
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.560]   sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.000]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.040]   it. And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.200]   but this last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe,
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.160]   it's called bark the moon and it's so delicious.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.280]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription. Right now,
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.720]   trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:25.200]   When you visit all thehacks.com/trade.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.640]   That's all thehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.320]   subscription plans, all thehacks.com/trade.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:40.200]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.840]   up your cooking at home? If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:48.080]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit,
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.640]   I was a skeptic at first,
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.320]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from any day,
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:57.040]   I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:01.400]   Any day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.960]   scratch in the microwave. And honestly,
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:08.280]   using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies the
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.680]   process so much.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.400]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook serve store and
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.880]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer,
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.160]   and oven safe too.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.600]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your any day adventure,
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.840]   I highly recommend David Chang's salmon rice. It is so good.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.760]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.400]   they launched last year. You have to check it out.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.160]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.600]   that's all thehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:51.720]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:56.960]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.240]   deals, and discounts from our partners.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.520]   You can go to all thehacks.com/deals.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:07.040]   So please consider supporting those who support us. So, you know,
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   using your children as an opportunity to practice some of these compassionate
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.560]   curiosity tactics. Sounds like a really good idea.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.360]   Help them learn to think on their own and maybe avoid some arguments.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.080]   Are there other tactics you use throughout your day to just practice better
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.920]   communication and negotiation?
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   So one of the things that I've really started to practice recently is
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.000]   validation and validation is a concept that most people don't understand.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.400]   I know I didn't understand it. I thought I did, but I didn't.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.120]   So here's an example, Chris, cause we hear people say, Hey,
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.720]   I want people to hear me. I want to be heard. I want people to listen to me,
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.960]   but the reality is they don't really want that.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.400]   And it sounds very weird to say that people don't want to be heard or listened
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.200]   to, but it's the truth. So watch.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.680]   So imagine if we're having a conversation and during the conversation,
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.400]   I'm on my phone the whole time. I'm on my phone, looking, scrolling,
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.520]   clearly paying attention and using my phone in the middle of the conversation.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.440]   What will you accuse me of doing during that time?
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.200]   Not paying attention.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.720]   Not paying attention. You're not listening to me. We feel disrespected. Right?
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.280]   And so we would say the solution is to listen to me. Right?
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.040]   So then what if, while looking down at the phone,
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.360]   what if I repeat exactly what you said to me verbatim,
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.360]   just a perfect transcript, how do you feel now?
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.800]   I I've been in this circumstance and my answer is okay, fine.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.120]   You were listening, but it doesn't feel like you're really present here right now.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.600]   Exactly. Right. So we say, yeah, we want to be listened to.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.200]   We want to be heard, but that's really not what we want.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.400]   We want something more.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.200]   And that's where validation is because you can't give people that validation if
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.680]   you haven't listened to them. So listening is part of it,
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.400]   but validation takes it a step further.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:59.120]   Validation shows that you care about the other person. That's one piece of it.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   But validation also, you have to focus on the root word here too,
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.200]   of valid validity.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.480]   They're also trying to find that validity in what it is that you are saying.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.720]   So in order to fully validate somebody, you need to, as best as you can,
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.880]   put yourself in their position and see things from their perspective.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:19.840]   And I even mean in a physical sense,
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.880]   because it helps you to understand on a completely different level.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:27.080]   So the first time I've really fully understood validation was when I did it
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.480]   with Kai, my son, when he was two,
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.600]   he had this habit that I thought was horrible where he would try to trip me.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.040]   I'm like, I'm trying to walk places and he's just trying to trip me.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.480]   And then I looked down at him and he's laughing and smiling. I'm like,
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.120]   why this is dangerous. What are you doing?
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:45.000]   Why would you do this to me all the time? So I said, no, Kwame,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.760]   here's what we're going to do.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.440]   We're going to look at this through his perspective and his perspective alone,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:55.480]   remove myself from the process. And so I said, okay, I am, I am not six two.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.920]   I am two foot six. I'm looking up at this giant and I love this guy.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.760]   What am I going to do? I'm going to hug him.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.520]   The only thing I can hug are his legs. That's the only thing I'm close to.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.840]   So he's not trying to trip me. He's trying to hug me.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.480]   And that's the best he can do. And once I realized that,
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.680]   I realized this isn't an act of aggression. It's an act of love.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.920]   And so it's not until I fully validated what he was doing and actually sought to
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.680]   find the validity and what he was doing and what he was saying that I truly was
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:29.000]   able to understand. And so validation is something that I'm really, really,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.200]   really working on trying to see things completely from their perspective,
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.920]   not trying to put myself in their shoes because it doesn't matter what I would
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.600]   do if I were in their position. I'm not in their position.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.720]   I'm trying to figure out given their upbringing,
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.760]   given how they're seeing the situation, what do they see? What do they think?
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.960]   How do they feel? And once you take it to that next level,
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.200]   that's when you have higher levels of communication and connection.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.080]   That's great. What about rejection therapy?
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.160]   Any thoughts on using that for practice?
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.960]   Yes. So I'm a recovering people pleaser.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.520]   And so rejection was something that I always feared.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.400]   So I would give in and give people what they want, those types of things.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.120]   And so there's a great Ted talk called the 100 Days of Rejection.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:18.400]   And the guy talks about how he, I think it was in like an entrepreneur,
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.840]   he was seeking investment and he was afraid of asking for the investment
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:23.080]   because he didn't want to get rejected.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.640]   So he would just find different ways to get rejected.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.960]   So it's asking for things that you don't think you have any right to.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.200]   You don't think you're going to get,
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.760]   but asking anyways in the hope that you get rejected.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:38.280]   So you start to develop a thicker skin because if you start to diminish that
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.520]   fear of rejection, if you start to recognize that there's life after rejection,
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.560]   then it makes you feel a lot better taking that step and being courageous and
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.960]   asking for what you feel like you want and you deserve.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.960]   And so that's something that I'd started to do as well.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.840]   And I had a similar experience as the guy in the Ted talk.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.760]   You start to get a lot of yeses.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.440]   I didn't think this would work.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.160]   Wow. I was trying to get a no and you just said yes to me.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.000]   That's crazy.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.480]   And so you start to become a lot more resilient and you start to become a lot
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.720]   bolder when it comes to stepping up and asking for what you want.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.320]   Yeah, this, you can use it at the grocery store.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.120]   You can use it at any store.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.520]   I shared in a previous episode,
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.320]   I always use the live chat on any website I'm about to buy something on.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.720]   And I say, hey, I'm about to check out on your site.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.400]   You have any special coupon codes or discounts?
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.480]   And I'm actually surprised about half the time it works.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.600]   But but so I say, you know, ask for a deal every time.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.360]   And the worst thing you get is a no.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:42.040]   Exactly. Now, don't take it so far that you come across as this cheap person.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.040]   But I've been using it since I heard you talk about it on your podcast.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.320]   And it's been fun to see what happens.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.000]   That's awesome. No, you're you're absolutely right.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.160]   Whenever you're in doubt, ask, you know, just try it and ask.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.560]   You have to consider the context of the circumstances, those type of things,
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.440]   because it's better to ask in these transactional type of things
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.280]   where you probably might not see this person again,
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.480]   you know, especially if you're practicing.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.160]   But yeah, I know some people who try it, but there are significant others
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:13.440]   that is nearby all the time and they're like, please, oh, you're embarrassing me.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.280]   Don't do it again, please.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:18.600]   So you have to use it with moderation, for sure.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:22.360]   Yeah, I love a good haggle overseas in a market.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:27.600]   And sometimes the thrill of it is more fun than the savings.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:32.840]   Yes. I've had times where I've loved the negotiating so much that I've said,
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.680]   oh, can we get this? How cheap can we get this?
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.040]   And then I'll end up actually just paying the original price.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.200]   But I'll feel so good that I that I knew I could have paid the lower price.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.160]   But, you know, I'm in a country where this person, you know,
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.840]   this is their means of income, and I've been very fortunate.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.200]   So I don't necessarily need the discount,
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.800]   but I at least want to try to see if I can get exactly.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.360]   And yeah, there's something validating to knowing you could get a deal.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.840]   And and then if you leave it on the table, you get like, I would say 80,
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.960]   90 percent of the the value of getting a deal by knowing you got it,
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   even if you don't take it.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.080]   Exactly. One hundred percent.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.280]   OK, so slight change of gears.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.160]   And I'd say this is probably more common at home.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.840]   You're having a negotiation, as you will.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.200]   But it doesn't always feel like it's necessarily a negotiation
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.240]   in the traditional sense.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.680]   But, you know, there's a lot of emotions involved.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.480]   And you say something and you immediately realize,
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.440]   if I had thought a little more, I probably wouldn't have said it like that.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.280]   Is there something you can do to recover in those situations?
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.840]   So never underestimate the value of an apology
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.800]   because it fits into the framework, too, because that's giving somebody
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.520]   and some emotional validation, acknowledging and validating
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.080]   the harm that you caused.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   So when you're giving an apology,
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.680]   the key word that you need to focus on is if versus that.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.640]   I'm not apologizing if I made you feel bad.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.960]   No, I'm going to own it.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.320]   I'm apologizing that I made you feel bad.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.000]   So let's say we're having a conversation and it gets heated.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.320]   So to your point, I say something wrong and I just say, listen,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.320]   Chris, before I move on, I just want to say a few minutes ago,
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.760]   I said X, Y, Z, and I was wrong.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   I shouldn't have said that.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.000]   I'm sorry that I said that.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.160]   And I hope we can still move forward
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.760]   because think about times when somebody has wronged you in the past.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.760]   One of the things that you want them to know is like you hurt me.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.480]   This is how much you hurt me.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.520]   And if I don't feel like you get it,
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.160]   I'm going to ramp up the emotionality until you feel it.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.920]   Now I'm going to make you feel how much I'm hurt.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.720]   And a lot of times because of our insecurity
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.360]   with dealing with emotions and sensitive issues,
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.880]   we might have made that mistake and we might recognize that we made a mistake.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.200]   But we almost say, hey, you know what?
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.800]   The best way for me to handle this is to not ever talk about it again
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.680]   and pretend like it never happened.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.760]   And hopefully they forget.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.320]   And they didn't forget.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.560]   But now what they think is that you are so disconnected from reality
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.680]   that you don't even recognize the impact of what you did.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.800]   So you have to address it head on and just take it on the chin and say,
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.520]   listen, I shouldn't have said it that way.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.960]   Or if something's coming out and it's coming out the wrong way,
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.760]   then I say, you know what?
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.880]   Let me pause. Let me rephrase this.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.800]   It's not a Lincoln level oration here,
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.320]   but you don't need to be.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.320]   You know, you don't get style points in difficult conversations.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.640]   And so if you recognize you're making a mistake, stop and rephrase.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.160]   If you recognize that you have made a mistake, stop, apologize
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.520]   and then see if you can continue to move on.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.320]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.000]   OK, in your definition of negotiation, you said any time
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.520]   you're trying to get something from someone, is that correct?
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.000]   Anybody is trying to get something from someone
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.200]   because you might not think it's a negotiation, but they're like,
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.280]   no, this is something I want. This is a negotiation.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.840]   So then it becomes a negotiation.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.400]   So can you negotiate with yourself?
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.120]   I'm glad you asked, because the Compassionate Curiosity Framework
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.200]   is a tool that can be used for self-reflection as well, the same direction.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.840]   So it helps you with your external and internal negotiations.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.320]   So you can and should negotiate with yourself
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.360]   and you should have that negotiation first.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.400]   And so you can think about the reality that a lot of times
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.600]   we don't know what we want or even if we know what we want,
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.000]   we don't understand why.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   So negotiating with yourself gives you clarity.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.440]   And so with that internal negotiation, using the framework,
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.400]   it can be used to help alleviate some emotional distress
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.120]   that you're feeling because of the same psychology.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.440]   And also it can help you to get clarity.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.720]   So you will acknowledge and validate your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.960]   So that's step one.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.440]   You're doing that for yourself.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.360]   What do I think?
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.520]   What do I feel in this situation?
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.400]   And you want to get that with as much specificity as possible.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   Then you move on to the next step, getting curious with compassion.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.040]   And so this is when we're asking ourselves these questions,
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.160]   just challenging our assumptions
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   and trying to figure out why it is that we feel this way.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.360]   But we have to do it compassionately, because with self-directed compassion,
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.680]   it allows us to go deeper into introspection,
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.160]   because usually we are our own worst enemy.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.040]   We have a very demeaning and aggressive and judgmental self voice.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.960]   And so we need to do that with self-directed compassion
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.680]   so we still stay in the introspective process.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.480]   And then the last step is joint problem solving.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.080]   So this is when we are reconciling the differences
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.840]   between our hearts and our minds.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.840]   So sometimes you want something emotionally.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.120]   What will it be that I need to do to satisfy myself emotionally?
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.880]   What do I need to have in order to satisfy myself substantively?
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.760]   OK, how can I reconcile those two?
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.680]   Because sometimes the best financial move for you
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.560]   might be the worst thing for your heart, for your heart and soul.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.800]   Like when you look back on yourself, would you respect the decision
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.440]   that you made, even if it put you in a better financial position?
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.640]   For some people, the answer is no.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.480]   OK, then we have to honor that.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.840]   That's an important part of you.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.600]   So how do we adjust this deal to make you feel a little bit better
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.360]   about the decision that you're making?
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.400]   And so going through this introspective process
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.520]   is an integral part of the process, because one of the worst things
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.760]   that could happen is you work really hard, you prepare,
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.760]   you have the conversation, it goes well, you get exactly what you want.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.880]   Only to find out three weeks later that emotionally it is untenable.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.400]   That's a bad place to be in.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.320]   Absolutely.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.080]   And one example that always comes up with money is paying off your house
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.360]   versus investing.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.840]   And there's this totally valid emotional reason to pay off the house.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.520]   But there's also a totally valid economic reason
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.080]   you might want to invest instead.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.400]   And neither choice is right or wrong, as long as you make the choice
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.480]   that's right for you.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.840]   OK, Kwame, this has been so incredible.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.160]   I'm going to put everything in the show notes.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   I might even try to write a little bit of a summary of the conversation,
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.160]   which I don't normally do.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.160]   But there were just so many great things.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.880]   Where can people find you, find your podcast, find more
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.280]   about everything you're working on?
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.160]   Yes. So if anybody is interested in negotiation and conflict
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.840]   resolution training or they need help with a specific deal,
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:06.040]   so deal consulting, check out the American Negotiation Institute dot com
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.000]   and also go to our website to check out those free guides.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.800]   American Negotiation Institute dot com slash guide.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.400]   I am assuming that the people listening to this podcasters
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.560]   are, in fact, podcast listeners.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.080]   So check out some of our shows and negotiate anything.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:24.720]   Ask with confidence in our Spanish language negotiation podcast as well.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.200]   And then I'm most active on LinkedIn.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.960]   I'm always posting and we have a lot of LinkedIn learning courses
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.720]   and things like that.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:36.200]   So LinkedIn is the best place to catch me for my social media.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.240]   And then, of course, I have Instagram.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.240]   So people usually follow me so they can see my cute kids.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.200]   I understand that I'm secondary on those.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.000]   I've come to terms with it, Chris.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.840]   I'm sure you're familiar.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.440]   Very familiar. Awesome.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.520]   Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.200]   My pleasure. Thanks for having me, buddy.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.800]   Wow. That was amazing.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.960]   I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.320]   I don't think the show notes will do it justice,
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.880]   but hopefully some of Kwame's free guides are helpful.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.800]   If you're new to the show and not already subscribed,

[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.720]   And if you're enjoying the show
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.440]   and haven't left a rating or review in your podcast app,
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.200]   I'd really appreciate it.

[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.440]   Also, thanks to everyone who reached out with questions and their favorite hacks.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.800]   I love hearing from all of you, and I can't wait to include everything
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   in the listener mailbag episode that I keep talking about.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.840]   I'd have it out sooner, but I keep having these amazing conversations with guests.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.800]   And so maybe I'll have to release it as a second episode one week.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.640]   Anyways, thank you all so much for your support.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.640]   See you next week.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:56.240]   I want to tell you about another podcast
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.760]   I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.520]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.880]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.520]   about building generational wealth and spending your money on the things
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.640]   you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.680]   It's hosted by my good friend Andrew, who truly believes that everyone
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.200]   in this world can build wealth.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.960]   And his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.880]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.480]   But recently, I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.840]   that will blow your mind.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.400]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35 percent of millennials
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.200]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.800]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.400]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.360]   with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.360]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.400]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.000]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
