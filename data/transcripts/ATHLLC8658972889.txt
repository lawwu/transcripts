[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.560]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.760]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.280]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.920]   journey to find all the hacks.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.200]   Now, I've had a lot of conversations about money and travel, but today's
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.760]   conversation is something different.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.720]   And honestly, it was so amazing.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.080]   I had to go back and re-listen to it so I could take notes myself.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's a conversation with Kwame Christian, all about negotiating, and it's something
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.680]   he definitely knows a lot about.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.760]   Kwame's a practicing attorney.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.280]   He's the director of the American Negotiation Institute, a professor of
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.920]   negotiation at The Ohio State University.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.480]   He's the host of the world's most popular negotiation podcast, Negotiate
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.200]   Anything, and the best-selling author of Finding Confidence in Conflict, How to
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.640]   Negotiate Anything and Live Your Best Life.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.520]   I aspire to have a resume like that one day.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.600]   And in our conversation, we'll get into so many different ways that you can
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.920]   become a better negotiator, not just in business deals or at work, but in
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280]   difficult conversations with your partner, your family, or your friends.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.120]   I think you're really going to enjoy this one.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.960]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.920]   Kwame, thanks for being here.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.640]   Hey, glad to be here, Chris.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.560]   So what do you think most people get wrong when it comes to negotiating?
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.840]   Well, a lot of times when they think about negotiation, they focus on what
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   are the amazing, insightful things that they can say.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.000]   And in reality, negotiation is more about the amazing and
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.760]   insightful questions that you ask.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.440]   If you can just simply start asking better questions, you're going to get
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   better results in your negotiations.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.600]   And obviously, if you're in sales or you're a lawyer like yourself,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.560]   negotiating is a part of business.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   But I assume this is a skill that is valuable for anyone?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.200]   Absolutely.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.520]   And so our motto is that the best things in life are on the other
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.840]   side of difficult conversations.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   So when you think about it, when you analyze your life, when you think about
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.160]   the most impactful moments, the biggest decisions, there's probably a difficult
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.360]   conversation somewhere in the vicinity of that moment.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.080]   So to a large extent, your success and failure, happiness and sadness, all of
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   those are going to come down to how well or how poorly you have these difficult
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.800]   conversations.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.200]   And that's both in your personal and professional life.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640]   And do you think there are people who are naturally better at negotiating?
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.320]   Is there kind of a correlated skill set or anything like that?
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.240]   I will answer that with some hesitation because the answer is obviously yes, for
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.200]   sure there is.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.760]   But I don't want to give people a pass because a lot of times people will just
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.840]   say, I'm not a good negotiator, but I correct them before I answer their
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.120]   question or respond.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.080]   I just say, you're not a good negotiator yet.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.040]   And so this reminds me back, I believe, Carol Dweck and Mindset, the book on
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.600]   Mindset.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.320]   You can either have the growth mindset or you can have the fixed mindset.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.680]   And a lot of people have a fixed mindset when it comes to negotiation and
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   difficult conversation or persuasion because they say either I'm born with it
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.920]   or I don't have it.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.160]   And so the people who say, oh, I'm not born with it.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.280]   They just say, I'm going to be relegated to living a life of failure and doom
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   and bad conversations.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.480]   But that's not the case.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.760]   And in fact, some of the people who are most likely to say, I'm not a good
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   negotiator, they actually have the foundation to become better negotiators.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.560]   So for instance, somebody who's more naturally introverted, so they're not
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.600]   going to have the problem of over speaking.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.560]   They're going to be more likely to be better listeners.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.360]   They're going to be more generous in their way of communicating.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.320]   And so that's actually perhaps a better personality based foundation for having
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.480]   difficult conversations.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.320]   How do you think someone should evaluate where they're at today and how big of a
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.720]   gap they have to close to be a great negotiator?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   I like to be outcome oriented on this, Chris.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.720]   So I would think about the outcomes, but it can't just be the outcomes because
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.520]   sometimes people succeed despite their poor natural tendencies.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.280]   So for instance, if you are somebody who is very loud, aggressive and mean, you're
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.840]   a bully, you might just say, yeah, I always get what I want.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.640]   So I'm good at this.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.920]   It doesn't necessarily mean that you're good.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.880]   It just means that you haven't run into that limitation yet, because eventually
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.720]   somebody is going to figure out how to deal with a bully.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.160]   You're going to have one tool.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.280]   The tool doesn't work and now you're kind of lost.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.760]   And so you have to think about the outcome, but not just the outcome.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.640]   Because when you think about negotiation, yes, of course it's a process and it's
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.720]   also the outcome too.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.440]   And the outcome can't just be limited to what we're talking about numbers wise.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.160]   So let's say we're talking about a deal.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   I know you have your background in finance and some work there.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.960]   So for instance, numbers matter.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.040]   I can't get around that.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.640]   Numbers do matter, but in the business world, relationships matter too.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.480]   So if you're getting a good number in this deal, but damaging the relationship
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   at the same time, it might have a negative impact on you going forward
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.680]   in your future negotiations too.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.240]   So you have to look at it a little bit more holistically.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.800]   I've always heard an adage of a great negotiation is when both parties are a
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.640]   little dissatisfied walking away.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.800]   Is that the right way to look at it?
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.640]   Or is there a better kind of guide for a successful negotiation?
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.440]   Yeah, there's definitely a better way to look at it.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.600]   Because if you're going in and you're saying yes, with this mentality, you're
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.280]   saying, yes, both of us will be in pain at the end of it, then you're going to
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.400]   naturally start to take paths that take you in that direction too.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.760]   I think it's really important for you to have a very clear understanding of what
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.400]   it is that you want and why.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.000]   And then also at the same time, go through this process, the negotiation
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.440]   process in order to figure out what it is that they want and why.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.160]   And not just taking the first thing that they say, right?
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.840]   So you have to dig beneath the surface to figure that out because what you can find
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.080]   is very unique areas of overlap.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.000]   That's where creativity comes into play.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.040]   And who knows, depending on the circumstances, we might be able to find
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.360]   that classic win-win, I'm ambivalent toward that term, but I know people
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.560]   understand it, that we're all looking for.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.200]   Oh, this wasn't as bad for me.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.640]   Oh, it didn't hurt you as bad.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.880]   That outcome might be there, but we might miss it if we're thinking that both of us
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.440]   have to suffer a little bit of discomfort along the way.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.720]   So I think it's really important for us to get very clear on what we want and why
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.280]   and what they want and why, and then figure out what path gets us there faster.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.360]   So it's kind of like the difference between strategic thinking and tactical
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.840]   thinking.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.360]   So is negotiating more strategic or tactical or kind of both?
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.640]   It's got to be both.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.120]   So I need to have my goal and then I need to reason backwards to figure out what my
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.680]   overall strategy will be.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.480]   And then when it comes to the actual X's and O's during the negotiation, at the
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.960]   negotiation table, while I'm talking to you, those are the tactics.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.400]   And so once I get clarity on my goal and then my strategy, then I can kind of
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.640]   cherry pick to see which tactics work.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.360]   But one tactic might be powerful in general, but not powerful in this
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.160]   particular circumstance, just because it doesn't meet our strategic goal, too.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.120]   So you always have to have the big picture in mind to make sure that you're
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.120]   picking the right tactic.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.200]   Okay.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.640]   So I want to talk about the tactics.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.160]   I also want to, you mentioned the negotiating process.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.680]   I'm curious about your process, but before that, I just want to understand how did
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:09.240]   you end up being the negotiation guy, the top-ranked negotiating podcast?
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.280]   Like this is your thing.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.440]   How did that come about?
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.680]   Yeah, as you could probably assume, it was pretty weird.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.400]   You know, this is not what little kids grow up and say, "I want to be."
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.880]   And so for me, my undergrad degree is in psychology.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.600]   So I went to Ohio State University, a master's, undergrad degree in
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.000]   psychology, and then minors in foundation of law and Spanish.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.160]   I wanted to be a therapist originally, and just because I was a people pleaser.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.480]   And so I had to get over that social phobia.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.960]   And so I wanted to empower people.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.520]   And so then I said, "You know what?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.600]   If I want to empower people and help people, I could be, I could do that more
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.080]   efficiently by getting into politics."
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.040]   And so Chris, this is where I started to get astray.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.800]   And so that's where I went to law school, did law school and got my master's of
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.240]   public policy in three years at Ohio State.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.680]   And so during that process, I started to learn more about politics.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.120]   And Chris, you might find this surprising, but I realized that
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.880]   would be an undesirable lifestyle.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.680]   I didn't want that for my family.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.880]   They deserve better than that.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.920]   And so I was that guy getting sworn in after passing the bar, asking himself
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.320]   what he wants to be when he grows up.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.840]   And so for me, I did some civil rights work, leaning on that public policy
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.160]   degree, health equity, to be more precise.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.560]   And then I always had an entrepreneurial bug.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.040]   So I started my own practice and built that up for a while.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   But I knew that I wanted to discover more about these difficult conversations
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.600]   because I had a class in law school and it was a negotiation class.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.040]   It was the first time I ever took that class or heard about the topic.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   And I fell in love because it was the first time I saw psychology used for a
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.640]   business or legal purpose just so clearly.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.320]   And so we had a negotiation competition and my partner and I won the competition
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.520]   at Ohio State that allowed us to represent the school at regionals in Ottawa, Ontario.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.200]   We won that competition as well.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.040]   That was with the American Bar Association.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.840]   And then we made it to the semifinals of the national competition.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.960]   So I was like, I like this negotiation thing.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.080]   Let's, let's figure this out.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.840]   Because like I said, as a recovering people pleaser, it was the first time I
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.320]   really fully appreciated that this was a skill more so than a talent.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.440]   I can learn how to do better at this.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.680]   And so I said, there are probably other people who are
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.120]   struggling with the same skill.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.240]   Let's figure this out.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.120]   How can I help to empower more people?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.360]   So my whole professional career was figuring out how I can get back to
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.000]   negotiation and how I could make a career out of it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.680]   And so that's what led me to the American Negotiation Institute, because the goal
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.440]   is to help people learn this skill.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.840]   And that's why you see me doing it at scale.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   So most other people in the negotiation consulting world, they target their
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.440]   clients and that's pretty much it.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.200]   But our goal, we pride ourselves in putting out as much free content as possible.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.320]   So we have the podcast, my show coming out five days a week.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.000]   We have Ask With Confidence, which is all about women in negotiation and
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.840]   leadership that comes out weekly.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.000]   And now we have a new podcast that's weekly.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.200]   It's in Spanish.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.920]   It's the only Spanish language negotiation podcast called
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.800]   Negociacion Desde Cero.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.880]   And that started on our network of podcasts about three weeks ago.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.440]   So it's exciting.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.240]   It's, it's fun.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.360]   And my team hates when I say this, but you know, it's the free work that really
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.920]   gets me excited when I get messages on LinkedIn from people talking about how
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.960]   they changed their lives with what they've learned through our content.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.480]   That's great.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   And then of course, the negotiation training and the negotiation
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.680]   consulting pays the bills.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.520]   And you said that, you know, this isn't what every kid wants to grow up doing,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.720]   but if you look back at your childhood, can you see glimpses of young negotiating
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.200]   Kwame trying to get things done that make you realize that maybe this was a
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.600]   path you were destined to take?
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.720]   You definitely can see that because I was always the peacemaker.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.120]   I always tried to bring people together to reconcile, help people to reconcile
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.600]   their differences and things like that.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.880]   And so I can definitely see that mentality coming out in different
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.280]   ways during childhood.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.880]   And I've also been, I've always been curious about people in general, humanity.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.080]   I find that humans are the most interesting animals on the planet.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.560]   So I like to learn as much as I can.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.720]   And so that, that is what keeps on pulling me back to psychology.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.760]   And that's really been helpful because it helps me to understand things, but also
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.160]   as I'm teaching other people, it helps them to understand not just what works,
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.800]   but actually why it works.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.040]   And it's funny, I think I've come from negotiating from a perspective of, you
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.320]   know, it's about getting the deal and a lot of savings and that's kind of the
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.480]   thing that's driven me, but it sounds like there's a process that you take when
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.360]   you think about negotiating, whether it's business or work or pleasure or anything.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.000]   What is that process?
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.720]   So there's a framework that we use that we, we call the compassionate curiosity
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.240]   framework, and it can be used in any difficult conversation, whether it's at
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.000]   work or at home.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.120]   And so it helps, especially with the highly emotional conversations that will
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.640]   come up.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.720]   Because the thing is, Chris, a lot of times with these negotiations, you have
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.400]   these really high level strategies that you want to use, these insightful things,
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.240]   your ration and your logic, you want to pull it and put all that together.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.960]   But a lot of times we don't even get the person to a place where they can
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.880]   psychologically appreciate what it is that we're saying, because we've done
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.000]   such a poor job of managing the emotions.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.720]   And so that's why we wanted to focus on the compassionate curiosity framework as
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.320]   our marquee contribution to the industry.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.480]   And so it's a simple three-step process helps, you know, what to say and when to
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.040]   say it for maximum impact.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.760]   So step one is acknowledge and validate emotions.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.120]   Step two, get curious with compassion and step three is joint problem solving.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.440]   And so you can cycle through it based on what you see.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.000]   And so it helps to alleviate that emotional distress at the beginning so
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.880]   people can operate on a higher level.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.320]   And then it helps you to gather information, but doing it with a
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.760]   compassionate tone so people don't get afraid and they don't want to be
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.200]   forthright and share the information.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.600]   Then last step is just working with the other side to figure out what works.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.640]   And is there an example you could walk through to kind of bring it to life?
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.080]   So the reason I still practice is because I want it's, it's story
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.320]   collection, Chris, for moments like these.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.680]   So I was in this negotiation representing a company, it was a
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.200]   manufacturing type of situation, multiple six figures on the line and the
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.800]   relationship between my client and the manufacturer had frayed significantly.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.880]   And it got to the point where the CEOs of the respective companies were
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.160]   sending offensive emails back and forth.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   So I'm like, well, you know, this sounds pretty bad.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.160]   And so, you know, going into that conversation, obviously we understood
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.480]   that there was a high level of emotionality on both sides.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.320]   Not only was there a lot of money at issue, but they were personally
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.040]   insulted through the process.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.120]   And so the funny thing is, the really funny thing is I went into that.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.520]   And of course I prepared, but I knew that the core approach was going to
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.000]   be addressing that emotional side.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.400]   Then I had my, my tactics that, that I would use down the road, but I was like,
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.720]   this is going to be my foundation, the Compassionate Curiosity Framework.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.640]   And then throughout this whole one hour negotiation, I used one tool, Chris, just
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.680]   this, that's it, and everything was fine.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.640]   And so what we did first, I had to coach my, my client.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.480]   I was like, listen, when things get hot, just let me handle this.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.280]   I know you're mad.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.480]   Let me absorb this for you.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.800]   Because if that person were to get upset and jump in, then
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.080]   everything is kind of lost here.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.080]   And so I just started off by asking the, how did we get here?
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.640]   What are you experiencing on your side?
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.680]   And so they would say their piece, everything was good.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.040]   Talking to the engineer first, they were very level-headed.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.920]   And so there was no emotionality.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.000]   So when there's no emotion, then you just skip to step two, which is
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.280]   getting curious with compassion.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.760]   So I was just asking a lot of open-ended questions, summarizing, demonstrating
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.480]   my understanding, asking more questions.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.840]   And so the fuller picture started to appear.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.600]   So not only were these people not evil.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.640]   Not only were they not negligent, but they were actually, they were actually
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.960]   going out of their way to perform above and beyond the contract.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.880]   They just didn't do a good job of communicating down the line.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.080]   They were communicating with our person's project manager, but not the CEO.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.120]   So there was, it was like a game of telephone.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.000]   And then, so everything's going well.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.040]   So I say, okay, great.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040]   We're just going to ask questions.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.760]   Then we'll cycle into joint problem solving.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.960]   This is, this is kind of smooth.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.880]   Then their CEO started talking.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.320]   He was pissed.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.040]   Cause he's like, this was like 20 minutes in Chris.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   And then he says, I have to address these emails.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.360]   And he printed them out and he was reading the verbatim.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.600]   And so he was going on and getting, he started to rant.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.040]   And so that's an opportunity.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.040]   Rationally, what you want to do is you emotionally will be drawn towards like
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.120]   counteracting every point that they make.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.400]   I'm going to counter that point.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.120]   That's wrong.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.000]   I'm going to contest that.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.880]   I'm going to contest that.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.760]   But here's what you do with the framework.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.960]   You don't pay attention as much to the specificity of what they're saying.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.880]   Of course you do because you respect the person, but that's not the core.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.760]   You listen more for the emotions.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.360]   What are the emotions behind that?
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.520]   I'm going to respond to the emotions rather than the specifics of what this
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.360]   person is saying.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.760]   And so what I did is I took notes and I listened to this rant for about five
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.400]   minutes.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.320]   And as he's ranting, I'm texting my client.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.480]   I'm saying, don't say anything.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.360]   Don't say anything.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.200]   Let me handle this.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.160]   And so all I did in response to that rant is I summarized everything.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.640]   And then I just said, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like with the
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.040]   emails that you received, it sounds like you were pretty offended by that.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.600]   So when you're acknowledging and validating the emotions, you're giving an
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.920]   emotional label.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.480]   And so they'll either accept or reject it.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.280]   And there's a whole psychology behind that.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.840]   And so his response was, well, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say offended, but I
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.800]   would say just a little bit disheartened and frustrated with the situation.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.680]   So even if you're wrong, they'll correct you, which labels the emotion.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.080]   And so then he started to explain a little bit more.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.920]   You start to see the level of emotionality go down.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.880]   So what you do is you stay in this role of acknowledging and validating emotions.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.440]   So you summarize and then say it sounds like, or it seems like, and then they
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.440]   start to calm down.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.280]   And I didn't transition into something more substantive until I recognized that
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.600]   emotionality was going down.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.840]   And then I got asked some more questions.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.960]   Then we transitioned into problem solving and it was really easy.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.840]   And I ended the call by saying, I have a sense, I have a sense of humor.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.400]   Listen, don't use humor in negotiations if you're not funny.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.480]   But thankfully the market has responded favorably to me in the past.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.360]   And so I, we were ended, we ended up and everything was, was good.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.640]   And I said, and before we go, gentlemen, I just wanted you to know this.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.560]   I am frankly very disappointed in the way that this call went.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   I was expecting a lot more emotion and more insults and you all were just way too
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.320]   reasonable.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   So everybody got a good laugh, but really that's it.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.440]   But there were so many opportunities there, Chris, to do it the wrong way, to
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.280]   start going tit for tat on the insults when he started to rehash, right?
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.560]   And a lot of times what we have to do is we have to recognize these little
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.480]   inflection points in these conversations where you could go one way or the other
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.760]   way, you can keep it productive, or you could try to make it a right versus
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.520]   wrong type of thing.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.080]   And so that's a really powerful example of how, even though this is a situation
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.760]   about money, very clearly about dollars and cents, very business oriented.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.200]   So just simply cycling through that framework was the right answer because
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.480]   what was manifesting itself as a substantive issue was really largely
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.160]   emotional.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.520]   That's amazing.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.120]   I feel like I've been in similar situations, both personal and work, and I
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.120]   haven't had a Kwame on my side to say, "Hey, be quiet.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.480]   Let me ask questions."
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.080]   Are there tactics you would recommend for people who don't have a master
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.960]   negotiator sitting at their side to kind of do to prepare to make sure that they
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.280]   kind of get the same outcome?
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.760]   Yes, Chris, and I love the word that you said.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.320]   Preparation is my love language.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.120]   So if you go to our website, AmericanNegotiationInstitute.com/guide, you
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.720]   can get access to all of our free negotiation guides that help you prepare
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.640]   systematically.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   And so a lot of times, still today, there are times where I don't feel
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.200]   comfortable, where I still feel a bit afraid or nervous before a conversation.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.760]   Usually that's because of a lack of preparation.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.160]   And so it gives me a systematic way to prepare beforehand.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.280]   So that's number one.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.880]   The other thing that I think people don't realize is powerful is proper role
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.280]   playing.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.040]   And I say proper because there's some ways to level it up.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.760]   So first way, you want to role play twice.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.160]   So first, you want to role play as the person that you're going to talk to,
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.040]   right?
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   So it's like, who am I going to talk to?
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.840]   I'm not going to role play as myself.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.360]   I'm going to role play playing their role.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.920]   And so it leads to higher levels of empathy because you'll start hearing
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.160]   yourself making arguments and rationalizations that you never thought of
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.000]   before when you're forced to play their role.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.240]   And so it helps you to be a lot more prepared and it helps you to empathize
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.920]   because a lot of times we just go in and we're like, this person is evil or
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.720]   crazy, like we just vilify them and write them off.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.800]   But when you're playing their role, it forces you to find validity and
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.080]   legitimacy in what it is that they're saying.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.040]   And usually it's there, but our emotions make it difficult for us to find it.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.560]   So role playing as the other side is the best way to do it.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.400]   Then you role play as yourself, do a second session.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.680]   And so what you tell your partner is this, you tell them exactly what you're
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.280]   afraid of.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.800]   What is your biggest fear?
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.520]   Is this person highly emotional?
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.640]   What kind of emotions?
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.440]   Are, do I need to prepare for tears or do I need to prepare for aggression?
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.680]   So you tell the other side exactly what your biggest fears are and say, listen,
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.960]   if they are at a five out of 10, I need you in this role play to pretend that
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.320]   you are a 20 out of 10.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.880]   I want you to take this to a level where it would be unrealistic that somebody
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.920]   could behave this badly.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.520]   And so then whenever you actually have the actual negotiation, whatever
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.040]   ridiculous thing the person says or does, you're completely prepared because
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.240]   you're like, man, I role played with Chris and he was awful to me.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.560]   You know, so you're ready for what life has to offer you in that actual
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.160]   conversation.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.560]   What about when you don't have time to prepare?
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.760]   I find that, I guess, business negotiations, you often, you know, you
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.560]   know, when they're coming sometimes at home relationship negotiations or
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.120]   conflicts, they don't always come with preparation time, but you can get into a
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.880]   conversation and that leads to something and you don't have time to prepare.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.680]   Is there, is there anything you like to do in the moment, uh, if you haven't
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.800]   prepared to make it a more successful conversation or negotiation?
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:57.360]   So let me start off with a disclaimer that I always get my guests to say
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.040]   inadvertently, but it happens.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.760]   I am much better at doing this in the business world than I am in my personal
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   life, because when emotions are tighter, it's like, man, I look at my performance
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.280]   afterwards.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.480]   I say, have I ever had a conversation before, Chris?
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.000]   I don't know.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.440]   You know, it's, it's weird.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.320]   And so all of my guests, they say, oh yeah, I'm much better in the real world
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.680]   than I am at home.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.760]   So let's just say that.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.720]   So I think that's something that we have to recognize.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.120]   And there are a few reasons why.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.280]   So number one, most of the time when we're having conversations at home,
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.160]   like let's say with a significant other, it's after a long day of work.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.680]   So you are already tired.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.720]   And when you're tired, that makes it more likely for your natural tendencies to
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.200]   flow. Because for instance, if you have a diet, if you're well-rested, hey, you
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.320]   know, I can stay on that diet.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.280]   But if I'm super tired, it's much easier for me to smash on some junk food
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.800]   because I don't have that discipline, that mental discipline.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.720]   So that's one of the many reasons why it's harder at home.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.760]   And so you have to create some time, either pause and just say, hey, I'm not
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.440]   prepared to have this conversation right now.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.840]   Would you mind if we have it at a specific time?
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.640]   You can just say it might be five minutes, but just be honest with yourself and
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.080]   with the other person. If they're really pushing you, then what I suggest is do
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.560]   this. If we're using the language of the compassionate curiosity, just stay in
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.960]   step one and step two.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.240]   I'm not going to try to problem solve right now.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.600]   All I'm doing is I'm going to acknowledge and validate your emotions.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   And I'm going to get curious with compassion and ask questions so you can
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.920]   express yourself. I'm going to focus on completely on you.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.560]   If I'm speaking less, it's less likely for me to make a mistake.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.000]   So that's all I'm going to do in this interaction right now.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.080]   And then let's say in the business world, we're very busy.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.520]   We are very, very busy.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.280]   And it's tough to get that time to prepare because I would tell people, hey,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.040]   you know, take an hour or two or prepare.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.760]   They say, where am I supposed to find that?
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.520]   Okay. So I call this the three minute prep.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.520]   Okay. And so sometimes a call's coming up.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.120]   I didn't have time to prep. That's okay.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.880]   This is how you can do it in three minutes.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.560]   First, ask yourself, what do I want and why?
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.480]   Figure that out. Write that down.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.160]   Then ask yourself, what do they want and why?
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.560]   And so use your best guess.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.440]   You want to verify that during the conversation.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.200]   And then you ask yourself, what are all of the open-ended questions that I could
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.880]   possibly ask in this conversation?
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   So you want to try to get at least three.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.000]   So it's, what do I want and why?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.240]   What do they want and why?
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.720]   And then as many open-ended questions as you get, you know, and you can do that in
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.800]   one to three minutes.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.840]   And just doing that alone will put you in a better mindset and help you to be more
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.080]   prepared for your conversation.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.120]   And why open-ended questions?
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.480]   And what are some examples of great open-ended questions?
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.680]   Yes. So open-ended questions give you a narrative response.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.920]   It's an information game.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.680]   Knowledge is power and power in negotiation is leverage.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.400]   You don't want to just give it all away, but you also want to collect as much as
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.800]   you can in preparation beforehand and during the conversation.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.960]   Because I think especially us raised with the Internet, it's easy for us to become
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.560]   a little bit too overconfident in how much we know, because we can just Google so
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.400]   much. But the reality is a lot of the most pertinent information is only found
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.720]   within the confines of their mind.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.120]   They need to share it with you.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.720]   And a lot of times they won't do that without proper prompting.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.120]   And so you want to ask open-ended questions because it creates that narrative
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.400]   response and leads to a lot more explanation.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.840]   And so I want people to explain, I want them to expand and share what they're
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.040]   thinking in with as many words as it takes for them to get there.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.160]   When it comes to some of my favorite questions, especially in transactional
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.840]   negotiations, this is one of the most powerful questions that you could ask.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.920]   And especially, Chris, given some of the hacks that you've told me about where it
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.200]   comes to saving money, you would love this question too.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.920]   It's simply what flexibility do you have?
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.360]   What flexibility do you have?
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.880]   So think about it as just like in a marketplace type of scenario, where you're
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.000]   at a hotel trying to negotiate an upgrade or whatever, just ask what flexibility do
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.280]   you have?
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.000]   Because number one, it's open-ended, so they have to elaborate.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.520]   Number two, it has the assumption that there is flexibility.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.680]   We're saying, "Hey, I know you have flexibility.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.080]   You know you have flexibility.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.680]   Just what is it?
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.720]   What does it look like?"
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.200]   Right?
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.000]   And so it's non-threatening as well because it's not an aggressive type of
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.520]   statement that puts people on the defensive, just very conversational and
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:23.840]   open.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.240]   So that's one of my favorite questions.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.200]   And then the other ones don't actually end in question marks.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.040]   So, "Tell me more about this," or, "Help me to understand that."
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.440]   Those types of things are other great sentence formulations for a lot of
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.000]   information.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.520]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.240]   I get it.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:48.440]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:48.840]   hang.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.880]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.280]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.360]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.400]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.240]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.640]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.160]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.800]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.200]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.720]   yours.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.640]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.880]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.520]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.200]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.880]   it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.800]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.200]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.920]   So, it sounds like if you ask a lot of open-ended questions, you're not doing a lot
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.080]   of talking yourself.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.200]   Is that the goal?
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.960]   Is there a target percentage for how much you want to be talking versus the other
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.400]   person?
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.000]   And is there any data behind why you'd want to do this?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.120]   Yes and yes.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.560]   So, I call it the 70/30 rule.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.440]   So, I try to speak only 30% of the time and get the other person talking 70% of the
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:15.720]   time.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.720]   In my casual conversations, I use it as practice and I try to see how extreme I can
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.560]   get that ratio.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.880]   Can I get it 90/10, 80/20?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.400]   Let's see.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.960]   Because every conversation is a practice.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.720]   I want to do well in these little conversations, so the big ones really matter.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.320]   So, I'm ready.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.000]   And so, the science behind this, a book reference, is The Code of Trust by Robin
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.720]   Dreek, former FBI agent, and his job was to flip spies.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.000]   And so, one of the things he talked about was with studies, the more you let people
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.880]   talk, especially if you let them talk about things that they enjoy, it creates a lot of
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.640]   dopamine in their system and they'll associate that positivity with you.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.360]   That's what ends up creating more trust.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.160]   So, it becomes self-fulfilling.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.560]   So, you let them talk, they feel better about themselves, they feel understood, and
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.920]   they start to like you more during the process.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.440]   The more that they like you and trust you during the process, the more vulnerable they
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.240]   will be and more vulnerability leads to more information as well.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.080]   And so, there is a lot of science behind it.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.520]   The more they talk, the better they feel.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.720]   Wow.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.840]   Now, it sounds like you could use this for bad.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.680]   Is there something you keep in the back of your mind to try to make sure, as you said
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.160]   earlier, a negotiation isn't just about winning?
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.960]   And so, I have to redefine winning.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.280]   That's really what it is, because winning has to deal with the outcome, for sure.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.040]   That's a part of it.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.480]   But I think you can win every single difficult conversation if you think about it in
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:43.920]   this way.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.240]   So, goal number one is to put myself in the best position for success.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.640]   So, what is it that I need to do or say to put myself in the best position?
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.400]   I'm going to do the best that I can.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.640]   Can't win them all.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.800]   You know, I can't guarantee that somebody's going to respond the right way.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.480]   I can't guarantee that the numbers work out.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.800]   But I can guarantee that I can choose the right tools at the right time based on
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   proper information.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.160]   I can do the best that I can.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.840]   Then the second thing is, if I'm improving during the process, because sometimes we
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.760]   might be tempted to take some shortcuts, like people might be tempted to lie in the
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.160]   process or something like that.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.080]   But is that improving your skills?
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.080]   No, it's not.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   And so, I think about every conversation as practice.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.240]   So, if I'm putting myself in the best position for success and I'm improving my
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.840]   skills in the process, then I'm winning.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.880]   And so, especially as a competitive person, I really had to divorce myself from the
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.680]   outcome and marry myself to the process.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.240]   That's really what it comes down to.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.360]   And if you become like too focused on the outcome, then it could lead you astray.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:49.000]   And then to your point about in the wrong hands, it could be used for evil.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.680]   You are 100% right.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.560]   And that's why I tell people, persuasion is just a tool.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.640]   It depends on how you use it, because persuasion and manipulation are the same
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.880]   thing, but it comes down to intent.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:05.800]   And so, what I did in my research is I figured out that all of your thousands of
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.120]   listeners, I know that they're all good people.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.200]   So, I feel comfortable sharing these skills, because your people use it for good, not
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.520]   evil.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.720]   Okay.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.680]   So, that means everyone listening needs to make Kwame proud and use this only for good
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.160]   things, like free upgrades and big discounts.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.440]   So, one other tactic I'd love your take on.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.920]   Should you always be making the first offer in a negotiation?
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.280]   So, you will hear a lot of people say, "Always make the first offer."
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.120]   And then you'll hear other people say, "Never make the first offer."
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.560]   And I will say, "Never listen to absolutes."
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:38.920]   Okay.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.680]   You know, I'm a lawyer, so it depends.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.120]   And it depends on this one thing.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:50.280]   So, if you have as much information or more information than the other side, then you
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.200]   make the first offer.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.800]   If you have less information, then you let them make the first offer and then counter,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.560]   because every offer has to be substantiated by information, and that's how you learn.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.840]   And so, one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that anchoring is a
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.720]   legitimate and powering tool.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.880]   And so, the way that I describe it is, anchoring is the most aggressive request
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.640]   that you can legitimately justify.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.440]   There's a lot of science behind why there is first mover advantage in negotiation,
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.000]   because it sets the reference point for the conversation.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.520]   Lots of fun studies on that too, but just know that there is a strategic advantage
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.120]   to making a competent first offer.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.720]   So, if you have that information, then drop that anchor, make that first offer.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.480]   But it is too risky if you don't know as much as the other side.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   It's kind of like a job offer type of negotiation, where they say, "Hey, Chris,
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.040]   we like you.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.840]   What will it take for us to bring on the team?"
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.240]   And you're like, "All right, you know, if you could pay me $200,000, I think that
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:46.720]   would be great."
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.480]   And they're like, "Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.040]   We can do that."
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.120]   "Feel dumb."
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.800]   You say, "What could I have asked for?
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.480]   I was clearly in the wrong range."
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.240]   You know, so that's the mentality behind it.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.440]   And if you don't have enough information to make that competent first offer, and
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.400]   someone comes back to you with something that you think is crazy, how do you react?
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.080]   So, there are a couple of things.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:16.680]   So, with the initial reaction, you have to make sure that you make it clear that this
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   is not in the range of possibility.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.720]   So, you have to set that expectation.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.080]   Because a lot of times, people will throw out an anchor, and they will try to read
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.200]   your body language, see how you're responding to it.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.880]   "Okay, hey, you know, they didn't like it, but they didn't fall out of the chair.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.160]   So, I guess I'm in the range.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.040]   Let's keep on hammering home this anchor."
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.640]   And so, what you want to do is you want to express clearly, "Hey, this is not in the
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.080]   range."
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.560]   But I think if we have a conversation, we could try to figure out a way to bridge this
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:41.960]   gap.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.080]   And so, for me, with an anchor that is outside the range of possibility, I'm almost
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.480]   going to act like it never happened.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.560]   And here's why.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.560]   Because there's significant psychological consequences because of the science of
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.080]   anchoring.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.880]   It sets that reference point, and the more you talk about the anchor, the more
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.080]   legitimate it becomes.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.840]   The more concrete and crystallized it becomes in the minds of everybody around.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.240]   So, that's why when I'm telling people and teaching them how to make an offer and
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.600]   using the anchoring technique, I tell them that you want to be creative about saying
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.720]   that anchor over and over and over again.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.920]   Because they're becoming more and more comfortable with it the more times you talk
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.320]   about it.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.480]   So, when they're on the receiving end, I'm like, "We need to pretend like that never
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.120]   even happened."
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.200]   Right?
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:29.560]   And one of the strategic mistakes that people make is that when somebody gives
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.760]   them an anchor that is aggressive, they try to attack the anchor directly.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.480]   Which is the common sense thing to do.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.400]   "Hey, that was preposterous.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.720]   I need to attack it and let you know that that will not fly."
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.160]   Right?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.320]   Now, here's why that is problematic.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.080]   Because it creates a scenario called psychological entrenchment.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:53.200]   This was explored the best by Deepak Malhotra in the book Negotiation Genius.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.160]   So, what ends up happening is that when you attack an anchor or an offer directly
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.560]   too forcefully, what ends up happening is the other person, in order to save their
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.520]   dignity, they have to defend themselves and the anchor.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.360]   And so, what you're doing is you're forcing them to create arguments for why that
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.840]   anchor is legitimate.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.800]   Because you're telling them that it is illegitimate.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.880]   So, you want to shift the conversation away from the specifics of that anchor and
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.160]   instead try to figure out the rationale behind it.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.200]   What problem are they trying to solve with that anchor?
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.800]   Okay.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:35.480]   So, I'm going to try to find a different way to solve those problems that is not so
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.800]   threatening or damaging to my business.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.080]   We recently purchased a home and when you're negotiating the price of a home,
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.080]   it's maybe one of the bigger personal negotiations people are doing.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.120]   And sometimes, you might think that that first anchor is about money, but in
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.600]   reality, we learned by asking the real estate agent what was really important to
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.920]   the client that no, actually, the most important thing was about finding a good
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.280]   family and closing quickly.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.400]   So, it's like, "Oh, okay.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.600]   Now, we know what's really important."
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.160]   And so, instead of saying the price is wrong, we said, "Hey, here's what we can
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.600]   do," focused on the things that were important to them, and then let the price
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:20.960]   be secondary, and it ended up being a little bit more favorable outcome because
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.160]   we were willing to move quickly.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.000]   And so, sometimes, you can ask directly.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.440]   Sometimes, if you're dealing with a middle party, like a real estate agent,
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.080]   you could just ask and say, "Hey, what's really important to the seller or the
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.560]   buyer?
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.280]   Do they want to close the deal quickly?
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.200]   Do they want to make the most amount of money?
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.640]   Are they looking for lower risk, like no contingencies?
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.880]   Do they just want to sell it to a family that'll treat the home right, in which
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.360]   case, you should probably write a letter?"
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.440]   I tend to say, "The letter's free, so even if you don't know if they care, just
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.120]   write the letter."
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.640]   So, that's a personal example where what I thought was important in the anchor was
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.800]   the price, and it turns out it was important, of course, but it wasn't the
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.640]   most important thing.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.720]   Exactly.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.040]   Yep.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.960]   And that's the thing.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.080]   Our assumptions will often lead us astray.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.800]   So, that's why it's good, like you did in that example.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.320]   You treat it not as an assumption, but more a hypothesis, where you go in there
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.760]   saying, "It's likely to be true, but I'm going to still test it during this
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.600]   conversation by still staying curious."
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.720]   Yep.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.760]   And when do you walk away from a negotiation?
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.400]   So, walking away is an art and a science.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.360]   So, we'll talk about when and how.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:30.520]   So, when it depends on how much you need the deal, and it also depends on how much
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.920]   time you have to close the deal.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.360]   Because there's some times where I say, "You know, if I invested about a couple
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.640]   more months, I think I could get this across the finish line."
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.240]   But the question is, do I want to invest a couple more months?
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.680]   Because there's an opportunity cost when I'm spending my time doing this.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.840]   And so, you have to have in your mind a certain kind of a shot clock, saying how
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.520]   many meetings and whatnot will I go through before calling this off.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.600]   And depending on the situation, you want to let them know.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.200]   I'm doing a mediation between two business partners trying
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.800]   to negotiate a business divorce.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.920]   So, I told them, "Hey, we'll do these one hour long sessions.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.720]   I'll talk to you each individually.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.880]   We'll do about two or three rounds.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.840]   And then at that point, if we haven't gotten to an agreement, I'm going to be a
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.320]   little bit more aggressive with how much I push you.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.360]   And if it still doesn't work, then we'll call it."
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.040]   So, sometimes it's appropriate to let people know what your stopping point is.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.960]   But oftentimes, strategically, it doesn't make as much sense, because
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.440]   that might be a significant tell.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.360]   You have to determine based on the situation.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.040]   But I think it's important to recognize that, depending on your alternatives,
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.400]   that might be the best option.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.480]   Because sometimes the worst outcome is a deal that should have never happened.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.320]   So, walking away always needs to be a viable option for everybody at the table.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.920]   Now, when it comes to how to do it, you don't just want to throw your hands up,
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.280]   walk away, and then say, "I'm never coming back."
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.480]   Here's what I say.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.440]   Based on the way that the circumstances are right now, this isn't a deal that
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.280]   couldn't work for us, but I want to say to you, if anything changes on your end,
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.280]   Chris, let us know, and we would be more than happy to continue the conversation.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   And similarly, if anything changes on our end, we'll do the same.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   So that way, if the other side was bluffing, and they didn't think you
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.960]   were going to walk away, now you did.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.600]   Now they don't look like losers coming back to the table.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.520]   I gave them an out.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.560]   They can just say, "Oh man, I talked to my CFO, and she told
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.240]   me that we could do X, Y, Z now."
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.160]   Yep, cool.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.280]   All right, now we're back to it.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.960]   So they can come back without losing their dignity and respect.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.440]   They don't lose face.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.240]   And similarly, I can do the same, because things may have legitimately
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.160]   changed in a couple of weeks, and then I could revisit the conversation too.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.200]   That's amazing.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.480]   I feel like I just want to go start negotiating something.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.760]   Are there things you think people don't negotiate, but should?
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.720]   Yeah, the bigger the dollar amount, the more there is to negotiate.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.720]   I remember in law school, I was bored, and clearly I just wanted to win.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:56.800]   I negotiated a $7 lamp on Craigslist and got it down to five, you know?
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.680]   Okay, that was dumb practice, but it worked.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.920]   But sometimes there are things that we just take for granted.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.840]   And so now I mentor kids who are going into law school, and I tell them, "You
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.480]   can negotiate your scholarship package."
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.680]   100% of the kids that negotiate their scholarship package get a better deal.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.400]   100%.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.320]   And all they do is they send an email.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.000]   So anybody listening, and you want to negotiate your scholarship package,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.680]   especially to law school, this is what you do.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.480]   So you say, "Hey, I appreciate the scholarship offer and admission.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.680]   As you know, finances are going to be a major decision for us, and we've
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.920]   received a lot of different offers.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.640]   And with that, I'm wondering what flexibility do you have on your
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.560]   scholarship offer?"
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.680]   And most of the time people, they'll come back and say, "Yeah, we can give
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.160]   you an extra $5,000 per year."
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.880]   They just have it.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.120]   They just have it.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.640]   And so that's why asking that simple question, "What flexibility do you have?"
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.360]   It's magical.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.960]   Okay.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.200]   So scholarships, are there any other things that people might miss out on the
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.440]   opportunity to negotiate that you've seen success with?
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.760]   So we have scholarships, cars are a big one.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:07.040]   We have a car negotiation guide, FYI, for people who might be buying their next car.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.600]   You can go through that guide and prep.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   I think the biggest ones that people miss are the everyday negotiations
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.760]   with family and friends.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.960]   And so the definition that we use for negotiation is anytime you're in a
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.320]   conversation and somebody in the conversation wants something.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.160]   And so with that definition, you're negotiating all the time.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:24.960]   Right?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.480]   And so for instance, with childcare, with my wife, she wanted to have another kid.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.120]   I said, "Kids are disruptive.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.680]   We need to talk about this, figure out what are these lines going to be?"
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.760]   And so for me, with what I do when I'm consulting on deals or doing negotiation
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.880]   trainings or conflict resolution trainings, I have to get on the plane and travel.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.600]   And so I said, "Listen, I need to be able to travel at least this many times per
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.520]   month in order for my business to be in a good spot."
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.680]   And so in order for us to do that, we need to figure out what childcare looks
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.080]   like for that to not be untenable for you.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.960]   And so instead of just saying, "Hey, Kwame, do you want to have another kid?
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.000]   You're outvoted.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.800]   Your mom, your dad, my mom, and our son want another kid.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.640]   So do you want another one?"
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.400]   I'm like, "Oh, fine.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:10.960]   Okay, we'll do it."
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.600]   You know, that's not a negotiation.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.640]   We can stop and say, "Listen, we can do this, but we have to have a conversation
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.680]   about these types of things."
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.400]   And so I don't think enough people recognize that these conversations
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.160]   are not just yes or no.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.160]   There's a lot more substance that can be gained through these interactions.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.400]   So we've talked about a lot of ways that people can improve their skills.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.280]   Are there any other common mistakes you see people make when they're negotiating?
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:40.880]   I think one thing that people miss is the fact that they don't understand the
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.480]   difference between what somebody says that's emotional versus what they really
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.160]   mean.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.960]   So for instance, if you're really upset, there's a difference between facts and
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.920]   feelings, but they feel the same at the same time.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.120]   And so I might say something very emotionally that is factually
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.200]   incorrect, but it feels right at that moment.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.240]   And so a lot of times people will contend with that and try to chop it down.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.720]   And they would just attack that thing.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.480]   And then they start to dig their heel in.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.880]   They start to fight back.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.080]   And they start to fight back, not because it's incorrect, but on principle.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:20.240]   And so I think it's important to recognize that we often invite the
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.760]   responses that we want to see the most by our own responses.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:29.000]   And so that's where the framework comes in handy, because your response to the
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.240]   emotions, not the facts.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.320]   And so the people are able to let go because their ego doesn't get wrapped up
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.840]   in it as much because they don't feel as threatened.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.040]   But if you make them feel safer emotionally through the process, then they
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.120]   don't feel as though they need to cling on to these ideas so tightly.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.560]   So earlier you talked about your family and your children.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.080]   What about negotiating with kids?
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.480]   Well, here's the thing, Chris, the simpler you keep it, the easier it is.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.200]   And so I use the framework with my family all the time when I'm on my game.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.280]   When I'm on my game, I do.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.080]   That's why it's so good to practice with them, because you're usually tired and
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.720]   you're not wanting to do it the right way.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.480]   And so I want to focus on that conversational habit.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.160]   So with Kai, you know, he's five, five year old kids don't want to go to bed.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:15.960]   They never do.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.840]   And so sometimes he'll fight and doesn't want to go to bed.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.480]   And so I'll just use the framework.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.320]   So I would say, Kai, it's it sounds like you don't want to go to bed right now.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.600]   No, I don't want to go to bed.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.320]   Okay.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.080]   That makes sense.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.680]   Can you tell me a bit more about that?
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.400]   And he says, no, I don't want to go to bed right now.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.440]   I want to stay up and I want to cuddle with you and mommy on the couch and watch
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.280]   TV until it gets later until you all go to bed.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.440]   So it sounds like the reason you don't want to go to bed is because you want to
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.600]   spend time with me and mommy.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.160]   Is that right?
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   No, that makes sense.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.360]   And we like spending time with you.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.040]   And so he started to calm down.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.400]   Now I cycle to the next thing.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.920]   So what is it about going to bed?
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.920]   That's important.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.800]   He said, well, I have to go to bed so I can get smart.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.480]   Okay.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.080]   What else?
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.680]   What else is good about getting sleep?
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.000]   He said, well, if I go to sleep, then I could grow up and be big and strong.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Like, like you.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:05.800]   I said, okay.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.160]   So what do you think we should do right now?
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.760]   I think I, I should probably go to sleep.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.280]   Okay.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.200]   Sounds good, Kai.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.600]   I'll see you later.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.800]   And you know, it doesn't work every time, but it's all about
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.080]   improving your winning percentage.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.840]   And I think it's especially powerful with children too, because the way I
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.800]   think about parenting is that I'm parenting towards obsolescence.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.080]   And what I mean by that is at some point I need to become obsolete.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.960]   I need to teach him how to become a free thinker and come
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.280]   to conclusions by themselves.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.240]   And when you think about the psychology of self-esteem, self-worth and
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.200]   confidence, things like that, oftentimes they say that you as the parent, your
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.320]   voice in many ways becomes their internal monologue, and so I don't want it to be
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.360]   the judgmental father who's just telling people what to do as a dictator.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.040]   I want it to be that compassionately curious.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.400]   You see, I'm on brand with compassionate curiosity.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.240]   I want it to be a compassionately curious voice.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.720]   That's asking questions that helps him to come to the right conclusion himself.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.280]   I'm teaching him how to make good decisions through that process too.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   So it's, it's good practice for me to make sure that I keep my skills
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.800]   sharp and really good thinking practice for him so he can feel
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.080]   as though he's in control.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.800]   Because ultimately I want him to make the right decision.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.440]   I don't want him to do what I want to do.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.920]   What I want him to do simply because he was forced.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.320]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.680]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.520]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.560]   So, you know, using your children as an opportunity to practice some of these
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.520]   compassionate curiosity tactics sounds like a really good idea.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.320]   Help them learn to think on their own and maybe avoid some arguments.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.800]   Are there other tactics you use throughout your day to just practice
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.840]   better communication and negotiation?
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.320]   So one of the things that I've really started to practice recently is
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:18.000]   validation and validation is a concept that most people don't understand.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.560]   I know I didn't understand it.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.360]   I thought I did, but I didn't.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.080]   So here's an example, Chris, because we hear people say, Hey,
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.360]   I want people to hear me.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.200]   I want to be heard.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.680]   I want people to listen to me.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.920]   But the reality is they don't really want that.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.360]   And it sounds very weird to say that people don't want to be heard or listened
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.400]   to, but it's the truth.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.160]   So watch.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.080]   So imagine if we're having a conversation and during the conversation, I'm on my
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.120]   phone the whole time, I'm on my phone, looking, scrolling, clearly paying
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.480]   attention and using my phone in the middle of the conversation.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   What will you accuse me of doing during that time?
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.240]   Not paying attention.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.320]   Not paying attention.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.400]   You're not listening to me.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.720]   We feel disrespected, right?
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.280]   And so we would say the solution is to listen to me, right?
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:07.680]   So then what if, while looking down at the phone, what if I repeat exactly what
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.320]   you said to me verbatim, just a perfect transcript, how do you feel now?
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.800]   I've been in this circumstance and my answer is, okay, fine.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.120]   You were listening, but it doesn't feel like you're really present here right now.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.960]   Exactly.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.280]   Right.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.600]   So we say, yeah, we want to be listened to.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.200]   We want to be heard, but that's really not what we want.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.400]   We want something more.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.840]   And that's what validation is because you can't give people that validation
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.200]   if you haven't listened to them.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.400]   So listening is part of it, but validation takes it a step further.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.120]   Validation shows that you care about the other person.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   That's one piece of it.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:48.200]   But validation also, you have to focus on the root word here too, of valid validity.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.480]   They're also trying to find that validity in what it is that you are saying.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.200]   So in order to fully validate somebody, you need to, as best as you can, put
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.880]   yourself in their position and see things from their perspective.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.480]   And I even mean in a physical sense, because it helps you to understand
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.880]   on a completely different level.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.560]   So the first time I've really fully understood validation was
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.400]   when I did it with Kai, my son.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.360]   When he was two, he had this habit that I thought was horrible,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.600]   where he would try to trip me.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.040]   I'm like, I'm trying to walk places and he's just trying to trip me.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.320]   And then I looked down at him and he's laughing and smiling.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.360]   I'm like, why, this is dangerous.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.160]   What are you doing?
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.520]   Why would you do this to me all the time?
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.760]   So I said, no, Kwame, here's what we're going to do.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.440]   We're going to look at this through his perspective and his perspective alone.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.120]   Remove myself from the process.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.480]   And so I said, okay, I am, I am not six two.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.960]   I am two foot six.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.920]   I'm looking up at this giant and I love this guy.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.760]   What am I going to do?
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   I'm going to hug him.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.200]   I, the only thing I can hug are his legs.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.520]   That's the only thing I'm close to.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.440]   So he's not trying to trip me.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.840]   He's trying to hug me.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.600]   And that's the best he can do.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.640]   And once I realized that, I realized this isn't an act of aggression.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.720]   It's an act of love.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:03.960]   And so it's not until I fully validated what he was doing and actually sought to
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.720]   find the validity and what he was doing and what he was saying that I truly was
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.560]   able to understand.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.360]   And so validation is something that I'm really, really, really working on trying
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.920]   to see things completely from their perspective, not trying to put myself in
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.800]   their shoes because it doesn't matter what I would do if I were in their
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.680]   position, I'm not in their position.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.800]   I'm trying to figure out given their upbringing, given how they're seeing the
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.960]   situation, what do they see?
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.880]   What do they think?
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   How do they feel?
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.960]   And once you take it to that next level, that's when you have higher levels of
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.280]   communication and connection.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.720]   That's great.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.160]   What about rejection therapy?
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.240]   Any thoughts on using that for practice?
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.880]   Yes.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.000]   So I'm a recovering people pleaser.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.600]   And so rejection was something that I always feared.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.480]   So I would give in and give people what they want, those types of things.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.200]   And so there's a great Ted talk called the 100 days of rejection.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.560]   And, uh, the guy talks about how he, I think it was in like an entrepreneur, he
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.120]   was seeking investment and he was afraid of asking for the investment because he
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.200]   didn't want to get rejected.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.760]   So he would just find different ways to get rejected.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.440]   So it's asking for things that you don't think you have any right to, you don't
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.880]   think you're going to get, but asking anyways, in the hope that you get rejected.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.400]   So you start to develop a thicker skin because if you start to diminish that
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.040]   fear of rejection, if you start to recognize that there's life after
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:29.080]   rejection, then it makes you feel a lot better taking that step and being
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.120]   courageous and asking for what you feel like you want and you deserve.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.080]   And so that's something that I started to do as well.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.960]   And I had a similar experience as the guy in the Ted talk.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.880]   You start to get a lot of yeses.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.520]   I didn't think this would work.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.240]   Wow.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   I was trying to get a no, and you just said yes to me.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.120]   That's crazy.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.600]   And so you start to become a lot more resilient and you start to become a lot
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.840]   bolder when it comes to stepping up and asking for what you want.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.440]   Yeah, this, you can use it at the grocery store.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.240]   You can use it at any store.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:03.440]   I shared in a previous episode, I always use the live chat on any
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.400]   website I'm about to buy something on.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.800]   And I say, Hey, I'm about to check out on your site.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.480]   Do you have any special coupon codes or discounts?
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.560]   And I'm actually surprised about half the time it works.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:17.640]   But, but so I say, you know, ask for a deal every time.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.480]   And the worst thing you get is a no.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.320]   Exactly.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.880]   Now, don't take it so far that you come across as this cheap person, but I've
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.400]   been using it since I heard you talk about it on your podcast and it's
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.360]   been fun to see what happens.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.280]   That's awesome.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.040]   No, you're, you're absolutely right.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.400]   Whenever you're in doubt, ask, you know, just try it and ask, but
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.200]   you're absolutely right.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.600]   You have to consider the context of the circumstances, those type of things,
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.960]   because it's better to ask in these transactional type of things where you
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.840]   probably might not see this person again, you know, especially if you're
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.880]   practicing, but yeah, I know some people who try it, but there are significant
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.640]   others is nearby all the time.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.520]   And they're like, please, oh, you're embarrassing me.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.840]   Don't do it again, please.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.680]   So you have to use it with moderation for sure.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.480]   I love a good haggle overseas in a market.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:10.680]   And sometimes the thrill of it is more fun than the savings.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.920]   I've had times where I've loved the negotiating so much that I've said,
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.600]   Oh, can we get this?
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.560]   How cheap can we get this?
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.360]   And then I'll end up to actually just paying the original price, but I'll
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:25.000]   just feel so good that I, that I knew I could have paid the lower price, but
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.960]   you know, I'm in a country where this person, you know, this is their means
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.920]   of income and I've been very fortunate.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.240]   So I don't necessarily need the discount, but I at least want to
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.400]   try to see if I can get it.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:34.840]   Exactly.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:38.400]   And yeah, there's something validating to knowing you could get a deal.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.560]   And, and then if you leave it on the table, you get like, I would say 80, 90%
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.560]   of the, the value of getting a deal by knowing you got it, even if you don't
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.160]   take it exactly 100%.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:49.680]   Okay.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.320]   So slight change of gears.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.280]   And I'd say this is probably more common at home.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.560]   Uh, you're having a negotiation as you will, but it doesn't always feel like
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.160]   it's necessarily a negotiation in the traditional sense, but you know, there's
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.520]   a lot of emotions involved and you say something and you immediately realize.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:10.520]   If I had thought a little more, I probably wouldn't have said it like that.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.360]   Is there something you can do to recover in those situations?
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:20.680]   So never underestimate the value of an apology because that, it fits into the
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:25.120]   framework too, because that's giving somebody an emotion, some emotional
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.800]   validation, acknowledging and validating the harm that you caused.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.440]   So when you're giving an apology, the key word that you need to
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.760]   focus on is if versus that.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.320]   I'm not apologizing.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.640]   If I made you feel bad, no, I'm going to own it.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.400]   I'm apologizing that I made you feel bad.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:46.040]   So let's say we're having a conversation and, um, it gets heated.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:49.400]   So to your point, I say something wrong and I just say, listen,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:53.800]   Chris, before I move on, I just want to say, I, I, a few minutes ago, I
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   said X, Y, Z, and that was wrong.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.720]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.040]   I'm sorry that I said that.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:01.840]   And I hope we can still move forward because think about times when
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.840]   somebody has wronged you in the past.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.800]   One of the things that you want them to know is like, you hurt me.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.200]   This is how much you hurt me.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.880]   And if I don't feel like you get it, I'm going to ramp up the
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.280]   emotionality until you feel it.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.000]   Now I'm going to make you feel how much I'm hurt.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.480]   And a lot of times because of our insecurity with dealing with
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.400]   the emotions and sensitive issues, we might have made that mistake and we
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:30.240]   might recognize that we made a mistake, but we almost say, Hey, you know what?
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.640]   The best way for me to handle this is to not ever talk about it again and
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.760]   pretend like it never happened.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.360]   And hopefully they forget and they didn't forget, but now what they think
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.760]   is that you are so disconnected from reality that you don't even recognize
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.760]   the impact of what you did.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.240]   So you have to address it head on and just take it on the chin and say, listen,
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.320]   I shouldn't have said it that way.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.880]   Or if something's coming out and it's coming out the wrong way, then I say,
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.680]   you know what, let me pause, let me rephrase this.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:05.080]   It's not Lincoln level oration here, but you don't need to be, you know, you
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.400]   don't get style points in difficult conversations.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.720]   And so if you recognize you're making a mistake, stop and rephrase.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:17.200]   If you recognize that you have made a mistake, stop, apologize, and then see
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.560]   if you can continue to move on.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.800]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.720]   Okay.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.800]   In your definition of negotiation, you said anytime you're trying to get
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.600]   something from someone, is that correct?
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.880]   Anybody who's trying to get something from someone, because you might not
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.280]   think it's a negotiation, but they're like, no, this is something I want.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.320]   This is a negotiation.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.960]   So then it becomes a negotiation.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.440]   So can you negotiate with yourself?
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.680]   I'm glad you asked, because the Compassionate Curiosity Framework is a
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.240]   tool that can be used for self-reflection as well, the same direction.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.920]   So it helps you with your external and internal negotiations.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.760]   So you can and should negotiate with yourself and you should
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.080]   have that negotiation first.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:59.200]   And so you can think about the reality that a lot of times we don't know what
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.760]   we want, or even if we know what we want, we don't understand why.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.080]   So negotiating with yourself gives you clarity.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.160]   And so with that internal negotiation, using the framework, it can be used to
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:13.520]   help alleviate some emotional distress that you're feeling because of the same
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.400]   psychology, and also it can help you to get clarity.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:21.800]   So you will acknowledge and validate your own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.280]   So that's step one, you're doing that for yourself.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.560]   What do I think, what do I feel in this situation?
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.440]   And you want to get that with as much specificity as possible.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.440]   Then you move on to the next step, getting curious with compassion.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.360]   And so this is when we're asking ourselves these questions, just
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:40.920]   challenging our assumptions and trying to figure out why it is that we feel this
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:45.440]   way, but we have to do it compassionately because with self-directed compassion,
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.480]   it allows us to go deeper into introspection because usually
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.240]   we are our own worst enemy.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:55.160]   We have a very demeaning and aggressive and judgmental self voice.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.000]   And so we need to do that with self-directed compassion.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.760]   So we still stay in the introspective process.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.520]   And then the last step is joint problem solving.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.120]   So this is when we are reconciling the differences
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.560]   between our hearts and our minds.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.840]   So sometimes you want something emotionally.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.160]   What will it be that I need to do to satisfy myself emotionally?
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.920]   What do I need to have in order to satisfy myself substantively?
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.960]   Okay.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.800]   How can I reconcile those two?
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.320]   Because sometimes the best financial move for you might be the worst
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.600]   thing for your heart, for your heart and soul.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.000]   Like when you look back on yourself, would you respect the decision that
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.760]   you made, even if it puts you in a better financial position for some people?
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.640]   The answer is no.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.040]   Okay.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.520]   Then we have to honor that.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.640]   That's an important part of you.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.600]   So how do we adjust this deal to make you feel a little bit better
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.040]   about the decision that you're making?
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.400]   And so going through this introspective process is an integral part of the
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.520]   process, because one of the worst things that could happen is you work really
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.480]   hard, you prepare, you have the conversation, it goes well, you get
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.800]   exactly what you want, only to find out three weeks later that
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.920]   emotionally it is untenable.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.160]   That's a bad place to be in.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.360]   Absolutely.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.440]   And, um, one example that always comes up with money is paying
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.160]   off your house versus investing.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.440]   And there's this totally valid emotional reason to pay off the house, but there's
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.120]   also a totally valid economic reason you might want to invest instead.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.320]   And neither choice is right or wrong.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.440]   As long as you make the choice that's right for you.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:22.840]   Okay.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.920]   Kwame, this has been so incredible.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.240]   I'm going to put everything in the show notes.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.240]   I might even try to write a little bit of a summary of the conversation,
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.840]   which I don't normally do, but there were just so many great things.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.400]   Where can people find you, find your podcast, find more about
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.280]   everything you're working on?
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.800]   So if anybody's interested in negotiation and conflict resolution training, or
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.280]   they need help with a specific deal, so deal consulting, check out the
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.160]   AmericanNegotiationInstitute.com.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.080]   And also go to our website to check out those free guides,
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.920]   AmericanNegotiationInstitute.com/guide.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.480]   I am assuming that the people listening to this podcasters
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.360]   are in fact podcast listeners.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.280]   So check out some of our shows, Negotiate Anything, Ask With Confidence, and our
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.800]   Spanish language negotiation podcast as well.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.280]   And then I'm most active on LinkedIn.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.600]   I'm always posting and we have a lot of LinkedIn learning
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.800]   courses and things like that.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.280]   So LinkedIn is the best place to catch me for my social media.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.320]   And then of course I have Instagram.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.360]   So people usually follow me so they can see my cute kids.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.240]   I understand that I'm secondary on those.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.560]   I've come to terms with it, Chris.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.000]   I'm sure you're familiar.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.920]   Very familiar.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.480]   Awesome.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.080]   Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.240]   My pleasure.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.120]   Thanks for having me, buddy.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.760]   Wow.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.840]   That was amazing.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.040]   I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.240]   I don't think the show notes will do it justice, but hopefully some
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.000]   of Kwame's free guides are helpful.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.560]   If you're new to the show and not already subscribed, please go ahead
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.680]   and click subscribe or follow or whatever it says so you can get
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.280]   notified of future episodes.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.440]   And if you're enjoying the show and haven't left a rating or review
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.840]   in your podcast app, I'd really appreciate it.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.200]   Leaving one helps others find the show and helps the show grow.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.000]   Also, thanks to everyone who reached out with questions and their favorite
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.120]   hacks, I love hearing from all of you.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.440]   And I can't wait to include everything in the listener mailbag episode
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.840]   that I keep talking about.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.320]   I'd have it out sooner, but I keep having these amazing conversations
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.880]   with guests, and so maybe I'll have to release it as a second episode one week.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.720]   Anyways, thank you all so much for your support.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.680]   See you next week.
