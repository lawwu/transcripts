[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Happy Friday, everybody.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Part of mature Bible reading is the willingness to stop and to ponder the hardest realities that God reveals to us in His Word.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   We don't skim over hard texts. We press in with questions seeking understanding.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   So this summer we're addressing three sobering questions inspired by serious Bible readers working through the first two chapters of 2 Thessalonians.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Namely, is God present or is He absent in His eternal judgment?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   2 Thessalonians 1.9 seems to say that He's absent.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   On Monday we addressed that in ABJ 18.01.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Next, many of you have written us asking Pastor John to identify this mysterious man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2. Who is he?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   That's today. And then we have a question about God sending strong delusions into the world.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Does He still do something like that today? If so, what is that?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   This third question on 2 Thessalonians 2.11 is on the table in one week next Friday in ABJ 18.06.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   So today we approach this topic of the man of lawlessness.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Here's one representative email from many.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Pastor John, my name is Jared and I live in San Jose, California.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I was reading through my Bible and recently came across a section about the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2, verses 1-12.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   At first I assumed this man was Satan himself, but it becomes clear in verse 9 that this lawless one is by the activity of Satan.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   So it's not Satan. In your estimation, who is this lawless man?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I don't usually read 12 verses of Scripture when we do an APJ.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But Jared's question can only be answered by specifics from the text of 2 Thessalonians.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So let me read the first 12 verses of 2 Thessalonians.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I think people will find it riveting, frankly.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   This is the sort of Scripture people hang on and say, "Whoa, what's that talking about?"
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   The situation is that some kind of rumor is going around in Thessalonica to the effect that Paul has taught by some letter or some revelation
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   that Paul himself has taught that the day of the Lord has come, meaning Jesus is going to show up in the clouds any day.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And people were quitting their jobs and mooching off of others, and Paul had to handle this feeling that was running through the church.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And here's how he did it. These are the first verses of 2 Thessalonians 2.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   "Now, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to Him,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   we ask you, brothers, not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed either by a spirit or a spoken word or a letter seeming to be from us
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Let no one deceive you in any way, for that day will not come unless the rebellion," or could be translated apostasy or falling away,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   "comes first, and secondly, the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called God or object of worship,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I told you these things?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And you know what is restraining him now, so that he may be revealed in his time.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Only he who now restrains it will do so until he's out of the way.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan is with all power and false signs and wonders
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Therefore, God sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   in order that they may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So Paul says that the day of the second coming cannot have arrived
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and will not arrive until the great apostasy happens and the man of lawlessness is revealed.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That's his basic answer to the hysteria in Thessalonica.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Here's my summary then from that text of what we can say about the man of lawlessness.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   There are questions that are left unanswered, but we can say something.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Number one, he's a man, a human, not an angel, not a demon, man of lawlessness.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Two, he is quintessentially lawless.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That is, he's called a man of lawlessness.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   He considers himself absolutely above law.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   He is lawless in considering himself subject to no law and no lawgiver and no authority.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Number three, since there's only one person who's above law, namely God who writes it,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   the man of lawlessness claims to be God.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   It says so explicitly.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Verse four, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called God or object of worship
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So this man of lawlessness claims to be the final climactic Antichrist.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I am a man. I am God.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   But I'm not Jesus. I don't believe in Jesus. I'm against Jesus.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   That's the ultimate expression of Antichrist.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   There have been many Antichrists, John says, and this one is the last.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   He's going to be destroyed by the mouth of Jesus and the fire of heaven when he comes.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Four, he is born for destruction.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Paul calls him son of destruction.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Verse three, his DNA, so to speak, is from his satanic father.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So he's going to be destroyed.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That's what his DNA is.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   He is going to be destroyed.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   He has no future.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   He is quintessentially lawless and doomed.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Five, as a man, he is coming nevertheless by the power of Satan.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Verse nine, the coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   He's not Satan.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Jared got that exactly right.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   He is empowered and driven by Satan, animated by Satan, serving Satan,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   accomplishing Satan's purposes in vain.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Number six, therefore, as a man, he will nevertheless have supernatural power.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Paul calls it all power.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Verse nine, and he will work signs and wonders.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And when the ESV translates verse nine and calls them false signs and wonders,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   be careful.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   We should not read that to mean they don't really happen.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   They're really not supernatural.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   This is cloak and dagger.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   This is rabbit out of a hat.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   No, no, no.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   It's not.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It means they really do happen.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Satanic power really is at work in them, but they happen in the service of falsehood.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's what it means by calling them false signs and wonders.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   They serve a lie.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   They are signs and wonders in the service of a great lie.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But the satanic supernatural power is real.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's why it's going to be so deceptive.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Number seven, and finally, therefore, the man of lawlessness will be unparalleled in his ability to deceive.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Verse 10 says he comes with all deception of unrighteousness.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Wicked deception for those who are perishing.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Literally, it reads in all deception of unrighteousness because two verses later,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   we see that the way he deceives is by making unrighteousness seem pleasurable.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   They found pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Now, I would argue that Paul is unpacking in these words, the prophecies of Jesus.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Listen to what Jesus said in Matthew 24 10.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   You see, Christians, this is a great apostasy.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   So Jesus foresaw a great deception, betrayal, a great betrayal, a great apostasy.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And he foresaw a horrible season of lawlessness in which the love of many grows cold.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   No matter how many forerunners of this man of lawlessness there have been in history,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   we know that none of them is what Paul is talking about.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Some people try to get around this text by saying,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "Oh, there have been lots of men of lawlessness and they've copped up in all kinds of seasons of history."
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well, that's true, but it's irrelevant because this man of lawlessness is going to be destroyed by the final fiery second coming.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Verse 8, "Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming."
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   This is it. It's over. End of the age.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   This is the coming of verse 1, when Christ gathers his elect from the four winds.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It's the coming of 2 Thessalonians 1, 7, when he comes with his mighty angels in flaming fire.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   It's the coming of 1 Thessalonians 2, 19, 3, 13, 4, 15, when the saints will be raised from the dead to meet the Lord in the air.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   In other words, the great apostasy and this man of lawlessness are at the climactic end of the age.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   They are brought to an end by the glorious appearing of the coming of the Lord.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   This is what we hope for. This is what we pray for. Come, Lord Jesus.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Thanks for the great Bible question. And thanks for all the great Bible questions you have sent us over the years.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Keep them coming in to us. We answer them.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And you can find them in our online archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   You might want to check out that archive. We might have already addressed your question in the past.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Well, here in the States, we are about to celebrate the 4th of July. That's on Monday.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   It's a holiday for us, but there are no holidays on this podcast. No, sir.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   So on Monday, we are back and we are going to talk politics, patriotism, and the pulpit.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   We have a great question on it. Seems like a good time to do it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and Pastor John and I will see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Have a great weekend.
