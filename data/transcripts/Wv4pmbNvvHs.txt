[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Today we look at one of John Piper's favorite Bible texts on the Christian life.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The text that I'm thinking of is 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Pastor John doesn't talk about this text a lot, but when he does, you immediately sense its significance.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   He has mentioned it here on the podcast a few times.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   A while back, speaking of 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12, he said,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "I encourage everybody to meditate on every single phrase in those two verses."
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   That was in APJ 1473 that he said that.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   And the text pops up on the podcast annually in early January whenever we talk about New Year's resolutions.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   That's because Pastor John calls it "the most important text in the Bible on resolutions."
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   That's a claim he made in APJ 1415, and way back in APJ 246, he called it "a theology of resolutions in two verses."
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   But this same text has year-round value because it offers us eight steps of sanctification,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   or eight indispensables for Christian living.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   As we see in today's episode in a great little sermon clip from 2012,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   here's Pastor John to explain 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12. Here he is.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   So let's read these two verses again. Verse 11.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   "To this end," and what he means by that in the preceding verses is,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   "so that you will be able to marvel at the Lord when he comes."
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   "To this end, we always pray for you that our God may make you worthy of his calling
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and may fulfill every resolve for good," or good resolve,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   "and every work of faith by his power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So, eight crucial things in those two verses.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Number one, there is a calling of God on and in every believer. A calling.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Verse 11, "that our God may make you worthy of his calling,"
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   that is, the glorious destiny that he has for you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   A destiny to be a part of his kingdom and to be a part of and shaped by, glorified by, his glory.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Easiest place to see that's what it means is 1 Thessalonians 2.12, which goes like this.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   "We charge you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So the calling of every Christian is that we will be destined, we are destined,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   and we'll be there in God's kingdom and in his glory perfectly someday.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So, your calling is to be in the kingdom of God, your calling is to share the glory of God,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   as will be increasingly clear as we get to that part of these two verses.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   That's number one, the calling of God.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Number two, there is a being made worthy of the calling.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Verse 11, "that our God may make you worthy of his calling."
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So that's what God is doing if you're a Christian.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   He's making you worthy of his calling.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Being made worthy of something doesn't mean being made deserving of it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It means being made suitable for it or being made fitting or appropriate for it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   If you know that the Queen of England has decided to come and stay in one of the bedrooms of your house,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   your thought will be, first, probably, "I don't deserve it, and the room certainly doesn't deserve it,"
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   which would be true, but what you mean by, "I must make the room worthy of the Queen,"
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   is that she's got the worth and the room needs some work.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   "I want to make the room suitable. I want to make the room fitting."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   She's already decided to come. It's not about deserving her coming.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   The Lord has put his favor on his people and said, "You're going to be in my kingdom.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You're going to be my children. You're going to be there glorifying me."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And then he goes about the business of suiting us out, fitting us for that destiny called being made worthy of our calling.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That's number two. Number three, there is a fulfillment, therefore,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   in the exercise of that being made worthy of the calling.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   There's a fulfillment of our good resolves.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Verse 11, "That our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every good resolve,"
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   or every resolve for good.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So the Christian life is a resolving life. It's a planning life. It's a purposing life.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's an intending life. God has given every one of you wills,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and he intends for you to use your will to make plans and purposes and designs and intentions and resolves,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   to do something right and beautiful and good every hour of your day.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's why we have brains and wills, volition.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And the question is, how do those resolves become real,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   turn into deeds, get fulfilled?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And that's number four.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   By the power of God. Verse 11, "That our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill,"
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   so God is fulfilling, "every resolve for good, every work of faith by his power."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   So our resolves become works by his power.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And he intends to get the glory for the fulfillment of our resolves,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   and that's why he makes himself the giver of the power. The giver gets the glory.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   If you did your resolves in your own strength, you would get the glory, and you should.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And if you depend on him to fulfill your resolves with his power, he gets the glory, and he should.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   That's the way he set it up.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And so how do our resolves become acts?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   How does a resolve to do a right thing and not do a wrong thing become effective?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   God's power, that's how.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   So the Christian life is a life of supernatural power,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   coming in, moving out, and giving us the ability to fulfill our resolves.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Number five, how do we tap into this power?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   How do we avail ourselves of the power?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   How do we depend upon the power?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   By faith. Verse 11.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "That our God may make you worthy of his calling,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and may fulfill every good resolve, every resolve for good, and every work of faith."
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   When God fulfills by his power a good resolve, it becomes a work of faith.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's the way I'm taking the connection between fulfilling a resolve for good and a work of faith.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Power of God enabling these to happen.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   When the power of God meets you in your good resolve,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   it meets you by making that resolve become a work, called now a work of faith,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   which shows how you tapped into that.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Got it?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   It's a work of faith. You could call it a work of power, it's true.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   He's just bringing you into the picture now.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   He's already said God's power fulfills your resolves and turns them into fulfillment.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   That is works, deeds, acts.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And then he adds, and those acts are acts of faith,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   which tells me exactly what my role is in availing myself of divine power
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   to fulfill the resolves I have in life.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Namely, I must trust him.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I must trust his promise to give me power tonight to fulfill a resolve I have when I go home.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   That's what I have to do, is believe him, trust him.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   That's the plug into the power.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   The outlet and the electricity is his power, and the plug is my faith.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I trust you. Click, power.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   The work of faith does. It gets in and power flows through it.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And God has designed it that way, because when you're a little child,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   leaning on God for power to fulfill your resolves,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   he's going to get the glory, which is where we're going in just a moment.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   In fact, not a moment, a second.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Number six.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   In this text, the name of Jesus is going to be glorified.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Now we're at verse 12.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   When God fulfills our resolves through our faith and turns them into works of faith,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Jesus gets glory.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   So verse 12, "So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   So when God's power comes through your plug of faith
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   and turns your resolves to do the right and to avoid the wrong
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   into an act of faith, Jesus gets glory.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Which must mean, since he hasn't been mentioned yet in these two verses,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   that Paul is assuming that the power that he calls God's power
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   is power purchased and provided by Jesus,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   which is exactly what I argued for last week.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   When Christ dies, what he purchases for us
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   is that God would now no longer be against us.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   His power is no longer devoted to our destruction,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   no longer devoted to our condemnation.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   All his power now, because of the cross and our connection with Jesus,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   is pouring on us for our good, not our destruction.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So anybody who knows the gospel,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and I hope that last Sunday's message hasn't ceased to be real for you,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   anybody who knows the gospel would know that it's so fitting
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   that Paul would say here that Jesus' name would be glorified
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   when God, by his power, comes into the life of imperfect people like me
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   who don't deserve any help at all from him,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and he takes my little puny half-baked vein, resolves to do right,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   and he makes them happen to some measure of good,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Jesus gets glory.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   That's right.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   God gets glory too, but Jesus is named as the one who gets the glory.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   He's purchased that awesome sanctifying event
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   that enables us to fulfill our resolve.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Number seven, and we are glorified in him.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So he's glorified in this process, and now it says we are too.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So let's read that again.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Verse 12, "So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and you in him."
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So as he purchases and provides the power by covering all of our sin
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   and providing all of our right standing with God,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   we are being conformed into Christ-likeness
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   because our resolves for good are being fulfilled by faith in that,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and the effect is that we too are becoming glorious with his glory.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   "Beholding the glory of the Lord, we are being changed
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   from one degree of glory to the next," 2 Corinthians 3, 18.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   "And oh for the day when that will be complete,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   when we shall be changed, save to sin no more, hasten that day."
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Lastly, number eight, all of this is according to the grace
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   of our God and the Lord Jesus.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Go to verse 12, "So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   It is all, all seven of those steps, it is all of grace.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Grace of our Father and the grace of our Lord Jesus.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   The power that comes to us moment by moment to fulfill our resolves for good
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   is the power of grace, the extension of grace.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So those are the eight crucial, indispensable, wonderful aspects,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   elements in verses 11 and 12.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Let me try to sum them up.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   How do they work?
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Put them together in the order that they work,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   instead of just the order that they came.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Paul starts, I mean ends, with the beginning, right?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   At the bottom of the Christian life is grace,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   and everything moves up from that foundation.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   If there were anything we could do down here beneath this
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   to get under it and make it happen, it wouldn't be grace.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   That's the meaning of grace.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   So grace is free, and it comes to us in our total undeserving,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and it starts to do good things for us.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And so it's all of grace.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   So grace is at the bottom of the Christian life,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   and now up from that grace, God's power flows.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And that power flows through your faith.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   If we were doing other texts, I could show you that the power,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   in fact, awakens that faith and then moves through it,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   awakens those resolves, and then fulfills them.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   But all it says here now, it's all we're going to talk about,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   is when you have a resolve to do right and do good,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   to honor God, to love people, to kill sin,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   that resolve, if it gets fulfilled, gets fulfilled
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   by the power of God.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And the way you tap into that power is by faith.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And when you do, then Jesus is made to look glorious
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   in your life, and you participate in the glorification
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   of Jesus by becoming increasingly beautiful yourself.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Somewhat in this life, unspeakably in the life to come.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Eight indispensable elements for the Christian life.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Incredible text.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   If you want to deep dive the podcast archive on 2 Thessalonians 1,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   verses 11 to 12, look for four other episodes in our archive,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   namely ABJ's 246, 367, 1415, and 1473.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   This clip was a clip that I pulled from a sermon
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Pastor John preached on November 17, 2012,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   titled "Living by Faith in Future Grace."
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   The whole message is available online.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   the time stamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Well, the Apostle Paul commands husbands to not be harsh with their wives.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   He says that in Colossians 3:19.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   So what counsel would Pastor John have for husbands who lack this gentleness?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   We'll find out.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   [no audio]
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   [no audio]
