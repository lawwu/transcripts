[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   Welcome to the BogleHeads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.140]   This episode was jointly hosted by the Pre and Early Retirement and
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.460]   Retired Life Stage Chapters and recorded June 4th, 2024.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.900]   It features longtime Boglehead and insurance expert, Stinky, also
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.300]   known as Wayne, presenting a complete overview of annuities.
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.180]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.860]   attaining financial independence.
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.440]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.860]   construed as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:42.680]   All about annuities in about an hour of talking time, basically.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.020]   And as Miriam said, we'll have roughly 20 minutes in the first section,
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.560]   20 minutes in the second section, and then 20 minutes at the end based
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.840]   on what I've done for timing so far.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.040]   And I'll encourage if you have questions that you not ask specific questions
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.080]   about your specific product that you're looking at or that you own, you know,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.860]   you can post those kinds of things on the forum.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.880]   I do try personally to respond to every question on annuities that I see on the
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.480]   forum, but it's often good to have discussions in the forum, but let me
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.200]   first introduce myself a little bit.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.160]   Wayne, also known as Stinky.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.000]   Stinky, take off on my last name.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.640]   It's a childhood nickname.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.100]   I've had that since college, if not before I am retired.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.320]   I have more than 40 years of experience working in the home offices of major
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.640]   life insurance companies, and I have held senior financial roles most of that time.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880]   I'm a finance guy, a math guy, I had a math major in college.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.680]   I'm not a marketing guy at all, not a salesman at all.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.180]   I'm because of my work with my former company and also some acquisition work
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.520]   that I did looking at other companies.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.260]   I'm familiar with the product design and pricing for most kinds
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.420]   of life insurance and annuities.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.820]   And kind of interestingly, I also worked extensively with the
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.860]   rating agencies and state regulators.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.660]   Um, you know, we talk sometimes about AM best ratings.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.580]   Um, I have visited the offices of AM best by my count, I think 19 times
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.700]   during my career on behalf of my company.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.380]   So I've been in Oldbrook, New Jersey, where AM best is for almost 20 times.
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.460]   I'm also, um, the person that started up the long running purchasing
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.900]   Micah's, um, thread in the, in the forum.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.460]   That thread now has over 2000 posts and over 300,000 views.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.020]   And I think a lot of folks have gotten knowledge about multi-year
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.380]   guaranteed annuities, Micah's through that thread.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.220]   And so that's kind of who I am.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.740]   A disclaimer or two, um, this certainly is not financial advice.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.980]   You know, I'm, I'm giving you my own opinions about things.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.600]   And my opinions come from my training and experience and also from being
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.420]   exposed to folks on the forum and their, their thoughts also consult with your
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.260]   qualified financial tax accounting or other advisor, it's only a high
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.700]   level overview of annuities.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.380]   We could go, you know, if I went two or three hours, you'd get deeper into it.
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.300]   But one hour is not enough to give an overview of everything.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.140]   And of course, therefore it should not be relied upon for any kind of purchasing
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.020]   decision or surrendering decision, uh, for annuities or financial products.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.380]   The opinions are mine.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.460]   I formed them, as I said, based on my training and experience.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.360]   And also based upon, you know, seeing things from the Bogle head forum.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.060]   I am pleased that I'm retired now.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.840]   So I'm able to be critical of some of the products that my former employer wrote.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.960]   You know, I'm, I'm not a fan of certain things as you'll see, um, during the
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.560]   presentation tonight, and I feel freer to speak about those things now that I'm
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.440]   retired and no longer drawing a salary from my company.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.040]   Um, and I've also never been an insurance agent or a financial advisor.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.680]   Cause as I said, I'm a numbers kind of guy.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.460]   The agenda, um, what is an annuity?
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.180]   We'll talk about that for a few slides.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.820]   The primary reasons why a Bogle head or anybody might buy an annuity and
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.620]   then get into the two basic use cases for annuities, the first is as a
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.020]   source of income, and then we'll follow that up with the time for questions.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.540]   The second use case for annuities is a source of accumulation.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.460]   And we'll follow that up with the time for questions and then for, um, uh,
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.340]   topics at the end for short topics, how our annuity policy order is protected.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.800]   How are annuities taxed?
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.060]   Where can I buy an annuity?
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.600]   And what questions might you want to ask when you're considering an annuity?
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.560]   So what's an annuity at its core?
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.520]   An annuity is just a simple contract between you and an insurance company
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.760]   that requires the insurer to make payments to you, um, after you pay
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.360]   a premium to the insurer and the insurer might pay premium might make
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.560]   payments to you either immediately or at some time in the future.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.860]   And as I said, there's two general use cases, income annuities, which
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.140]   is kind of a regular, usually monthly payment of the annuitant or for
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.500]   accumulation, growing a deposit over time, using interest credits
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.620]   or stock market performance.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.580]   So the income or accumulation, you know, when you look at the posts
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.860]   in the forum and some of the threads that you follow, you'll see a lot
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.000]   of discussion of single premium, immediate annuities, and people think
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.940]   of that as the basic kind of annuity.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.880]   Spia, which pays out a monthly amount, uh, in return in exchange for a
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.560]   freemium, but literally 95% of current annuity sales are used for accumulation.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.680]   Annuities are used these days as a savings vehicle, primarily, um, almost
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   entirely with the monthly income being a very secondary use case for annuities.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.720]   Uh, I will note, however, every annuity that you buy, um, has
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.680]   the ability to allow for income.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.620]   I'll talk frequently tonight about migas and I might use a hundred thousand
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.220]   dollar miga premium or a hundred thousand dollars to be a premium or whatever.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.040]   But if I buy a hundred thousand dollar miga, I'll probably be
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.620]   using that for accumulation, but I will be able to turn that
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.220]   into an income stream if I choose.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.460]   And the acronym miga, M Y G A I'll define that better later, but it's
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.420]   a multi-year guaranteed annuity.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.420]   So I'll come back to that and just find that more fully in the second
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.900]   section of this presentation.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.520]   So the primary reasons why a bogey head might buy an annuity for the
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.320]   use case of income, there's really just one case there you're converting
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.600]   a lump sum of money, my a hundred thousand dollars into a guaranteed
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   monthly paycheck for life of, let's say a thousand dollars a month.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.280]   So it's a simple use case.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   It's a simple product.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.520]   You can also do an income, the use case of an income for a fixed period.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.680]   I give my a hundred thousand dollars to the insurance company and they'll
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.840]   promise to pay me on a monthly basis for 10 years and then stop
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   when the 10 year period is over.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.680]   So that's the use case of, of, of income to use an annuity in that way.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.480]   The use case of accumulation can be several things.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.520]   First, you might be able to earn a guaranteed attractive rate of
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.720]   interest over a period of time, like with a multi-year guaranteed annuity.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.240]   So you're earning interest on a deposit to make with insurance company.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.040]   You can also use an accumulation or annuity to defer the
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.440]   reporting of taxable income.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.640]   There'll be times where people find it attractive to not have to make an
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.440]   investment and to defer the reporting of income for many, you know, several
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.480]   or many years in the future, we'll talk about that later a little bit.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.800]   You can also use an accumulation or annuity as a 1035 exchange vehicle
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   from another annuity or a cash value life insurance policy.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.240]   We'll talk about that a bit later also, but those are your basic
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.920]   reasons why you might buy an annuity.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.480]   There are more reasons we could go deeper into things.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.800]   The primary use cases are income and accumulation, and then those
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.000]   reasons that I've listed out there.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.880]   Now going into income annuities, income annuities.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.440]   I'm going to talk about four forms of income annuities here.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.200]   Uh, spears Diaz, uh, annuitization options and QX.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.120]   And I'll go into a slide or two on each of those things right now.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.680]   A single premium, a media annuity, a SPIA, that is the simplest kind
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.280]   of annuity that there really is.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.440]   A person will pay a premium to an insurance company.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.120]   Let's say again, a hundred thousand dollars and the payments usually
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.680]   monthly, we'll start within one year after the premium was paid.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.640]   And typically they'll start a month or two after that premium was paid.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   And so, um, those payments in most cases or many cases will continue
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.960]   for the life of the insured.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.520]   So long as you're breathing, you're getting that monthly
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.640]   check from the insurance company.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:38.440]   Um, you can also, as I think I said before, uh, purchase a, uh,
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.960]   SPIA for a period certain you can buy it for 10 years and a use case for
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.520]   that might be someone who's 60 years old, doesn't plan to take
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.760]   social security until they're 70.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.040]   They're retiring.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.640]   They want to have a sum of money that they put aside right now and have
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.560]   a planned amount, a paycheck coming in every month from the insurance
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.640]   company for 10 years and then stop when social security starts.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.040]   And so that'd be a fine use case there for a SPIA.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.880]   When a person's buying a SPIA for life, you know, Taylor Laramore has
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.520]   mentioned numerous times on the forum about how SPIA is the best thing he's
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.080]   ever bought, um, because it continues to pay as now he's a hundred years old.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.680]   There are additional options beyond just a single life SPIA that I might
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.320]   buy on myself from my life only.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.920]   One of the most typical things is to have a joint SPIA that is I and my spouse
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.360]   could have an annuity that'll pay out.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.840]   So almost either one of us will survive and we'll stop only when
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.520]   the second one of us dies.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.760]   Now, of course, that if I was putting down my a hundred thousand, getting a
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.160]   thousand dollars a month, if I include my wife, who's a female, who's younger
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.680]   than me, who will likely live longer than me, the month of payment might
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.000]   be less than a thousand dollars.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.160]   Cause they're going to pay till the second one of us dies.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.840]   A period certain annuity.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.760]   That's the 10 year annuity that I've been talking about that, uh, that
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.000]   just pays for a period certain, but you can also buy an annuity.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.960]   It's pays out for your life, but a minimum of 10 years.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.040]   And so a period certain means that there's a certain period of time that
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.240]   will be paid for, and then in addition, it will continue paying after
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.520]   that for as long as I'm alive.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.960]   A refund feature would say, um, if I pay my a hundred thousand dollars, it
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.920]   would take a hundred months to recoup that a hundred thousand
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.960]   dollars and a thousand dollars.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.360]   A month.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.040]   If I died in month 90 or month 80, then the premiums would likely, or
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.360]   the payments would likely continue until they reached one month.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.880]   100.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.520]   My beneficiary would get the refund of the additional payments to get back
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.680]   to my a hundred thousand dollar initial premium, and then finally increasing.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.160]   Most of these are sold as a level of amount, $1,000 or whatever per month.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   However, there are options offered by most all companies to increase
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.800]   those payments by 1%, 2%, 3% per year.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:08.000]   And to my knowledge today in the, in the U S those are only offered, um,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.640]   in, you know, percentage insurance, like one, two, 3%, et cetera.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.560]   There's no insurance company that I'm aware of that offers a single
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.040]   premium immediate annuity that's tied to the CPI, um, they were, they have
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.560]   been sold at sometimes in the past, but they were not very popular at all.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.760]   And they're not available now to my knowledge, but you can buy one that
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.960]   increases, um, it's payments over time.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.600]   And of course, if you're getting an increasing payment over time, your
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.200]   initial payment will be lower than that thousand dollars a month to compensate
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.480]   for the higher payments later on.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.080]   So that's a spiel, single premium, immediate annuity, SPIA, a
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.880]   deferred income annuity, a deal.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.400]   Is very similar to a SPIA, except that the payments start more than
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.240]   one year after the premium is paid.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.480]   Let's say for example, I'm 65 years old.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.960]   I'm certain that I want to put down a premium today and start
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.120]   receiving payments when I'm 75.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.320]   No payments to me between 65 and 75.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.600]   Then payments commence when I'm 75.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.800]   Of course, if I put down my a hundred thousand dollars, I can get a lot more
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   than my thousand dollars a month because I'm not getting payments for the next
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.680]   10 years and the insurance company can invest that money and is not paying it
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.120]   out to me, um, so, but there might be a use case where I know that I want to
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.320]   have payments starting five years or 10 years or whatever out, um, some deals
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.040]   are sold without a death benefit.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.240]   So if I'm 65, I buy it and I die at age 72, nothing goes to my beneficiary.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.000]   However, you can buy a return of premium.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.080]   So that if I die when I'm 72, that they'll get my premium
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.640]   back as a, as a death benefit.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.920]   Uh, that's an optional return of premium.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.320]   I'll also say that in place of a deal, a regular traditional deferred income
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.880]   annuity, you can have the same use with an indexed annuity with a
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.520]   guaranteed withdrawal benefit rider.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.400]   Um, we'll talk about that a little bit later on.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.280]   Most mogul heads don't care too much for indexed annuities.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.280]   But if you attach a guaranteed withdrawal benefit rider, that
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.640]   effectively turns it into a guaranteed product where the company can't mess
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.160]   with you and cutting your accredited rates in the future, and you can have
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.160]   equivalent benefits to a deferred income annuity with a indexed annuity
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.400]   with a guaranteed withdrawal rider.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.320]   So I believe that a prospective DIA buyer should look at both options,
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.800]   both the DIA and an indexed annuity with a withdrawal benefit rider.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.640]   So that's a deal, something where payments start more than one year in
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.160]   the future after the premium is received.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.560]   Next is the annuitization options in life insurance or annuity policies.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   If you look at any life insurance policy that you own and turn away
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.160]   to the back of the policy, you'll see that there are ways that the, uh,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.760]   insurance company can pay out the life insurance benefit.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.600]   The vast majority of people take their life insurance benefits as either a
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.520]   cash, you know, a one-time check or as a checkbook that they draw down pretty
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.160]   quickly, but you do have the option in every life insurance policy to take the
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.240]   benefit, the life insurance benefit as an annuity for your life or for some period.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.840]   Same thing with every annuity, every annuity, be it a variable annuity or a
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.200]   MIGA or an indexed annuity, whatever.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.760]   The vast majority of those are used for accumulation purposes, but there's a
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.000]   little clause at the end saying that if you want to turn this into a payment
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.520]   stream that you can, and then the options that you have there for life
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.480]   only period, certain, et cetera, it's like you'd have an SPM.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.840]   So that's the third use case or the third kind of, uh, annuization options.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.080]   And the fourth is a qualified longevity annuity, a QAC.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.840]   Uh, that is a fairly new thing, uh, enabled under the tax code.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.120]   It's a payout annuity funded with an investment from a IRA.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.240]   It's a, so it's qualified money, uh, or a 401k or something else.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.400]   Um, the start of payments on that is, can be as soon as almost immediately
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.320]   after you make the premium payment from your IRA or whatever, or
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.160]   it can be as late as age 85.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.960]   And you can do it either on your own life or on the life of you and your spouse.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.880]   A benefit of the QLAC is that you can reduce your required minimum
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.160]   distributions from your, um, uh, IRA by putting part of it into a QLAC.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.840]   Here's an example for you.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.640]   You have a million dollar IRA, the IRA, the required minimum
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.240]   distribution percentage is 4%.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.200]   So you've got to take out $40,000 in that year.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:49.400]   Well, if you apply $200,000 of that IRA balance to a QLAC, then you'll be able
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.120]   to reduce your IRA balance that's used for RMD purposes from a million dollars
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:00.240]   to 800,000, and then you can, uh, have 800,000 times 4% or 32,000, a smaller.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.240]   RMD, and you've got to eventually pay the Piper when that QLAC starts
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.520]   churning out cash at the date and the age that you define, then that'll all
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.040]   be taxable income at that point, but you can defer having, um, income from your,
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:22.280]   uh, uh, your IRA by using part of it to, uh, fund a QLAC the maximum premium
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.520]   per the law right now is $200,000.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.080]   Uh, one time or 200,000, maybe, maybe you can do multiple tranches,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.120]   but 200,000 in total, and that will be adjusted with inflation.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.720]   So that's the fourth kind of, uh, of a, uh, payout annuity.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   So in summary about income annuities in general, I'm going to say in this
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.560]   presentation, a number of times, many Bogle heads feel, well, I sense, you
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.320]   know, by reading the comments that the people post, I think that a lot
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.080]   of folks feel this way, Bogle heads are not, um, monolithic.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.480]   They do have different opinions and different views on things, but from
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.080]   the comments that I see would line up pretty well with my personal beliefs.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.720]   Most Bogle heads, I think, feel that annuities bought for income purposes
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.560]   are a pretty good consumer value.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.520]   They are a simple, straightforward product design.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.160]   There's no hidden fees.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.200]   What you see is what you get.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.640]   You know, if you put down your a hundred thousand dollars for a SPIA and you get
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.080]   your thousand dollars a month, that's about as simple a contract as you can
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.120]   possibly have, and there's no hidden fees.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.680]   There's no nothing at all.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.680]   It's all locked in.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.560]   Um, and, and you, a person is allowed then is enabled to be able to lock
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.920]   in an income stream over an extended period of time, I can take my premium
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.480]   and I can lock in my thousand dollars a month for the remainder of my life.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.520]   Come hell or high water.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.960]   I'll get that thousand a month.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.720]   So long as I'm breathing, it allows me to get higher monthly income than a
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.720]   withdrawal method, like the 4% rule.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.960]   You know, if I had my million dollar, um, IRA, I might only be able to get
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.720]   $40,000 a year out, uh, using the 4% rule, but I can get a higher
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.280]   amount out, uh, by buying a SPIA.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.600]   And of course there you got to pay the piper.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.160]   The reason that you can get that higher amount out is because if there's a
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.920]   residual value in my IRA, when I die, that'll go to my beneficiaries, but
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   unless I have some kind of a refund option in my SPIA, when I die, there's
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.080]   no residual value at all, so you can get more money while you're alive, but
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.720]   you don't end up having a residual value for your beneficiaries.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.360]   But you can get higher payments.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.280]   And for some people, it's an important thing to maximize current income.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.400]   And that might be attractive if you have no errors that you care
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   about or anything like that.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.480]   One thing common around frequently on the forum is that inflow inflation does erode
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.120]   the real value of payments over time.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.280]   Almost all of these annuities are done in nominal dollars, $1,000 a month.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.440]   And so a thousand dollars a month in 2024 is almost certainly less than
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.720]   a thousand dollars will be in 2034 or 2044, so inflation does erode the real
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.840]   value of an annuity payment stream over time based on what people post in the
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:08.000]   forum, the, you can buy a SPIA as young as age 40, but the vast majority of
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.880]   folks will be waiting until there's some time in their late sixties, early
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.160]   seventies, mid seventies, maybe up in their eighties, that's the time when.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.160]   You're getting closer to the end of your life.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.480]   The payments are higher and more attractive for a thousand
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.400]   or a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:23.920]   A premium.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.520]   And a lot of folks seem to think that's a sweet spot for buying an annuity, a
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.920]   payout annuity of some type at that age.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:36.600]   I'll also finally note that there are some lucky people in this group that
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.880]   still have an old style defined benefit pension plan and the many defined
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.000]   benefit pension plans have an option for taking a, uh, either a monthly
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.240]   paycheck, once you retire a pension check or getting a lump sum.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.440]   And so the purchasing decision for that.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.360]   Uh, annuity is very similar to thinking about a SPIA with a SPIA.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.600]   You have a lump sum of money.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.520]   You choose to give it to an insurance company to buy a, uh, a monthly benefit.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.840]   The same kind of calculation is there.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.960]   If you have a cash, if you have a defined benefit plan with a lump sum option,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.840]   you have a lump sum available to you, but you can also go ahead
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.640]   and use that to buy a pension.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.280]   And so with that, I finished up the first part of my presentation here.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.640]   And, uh, we'll take a few questions.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.440]   Okay.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.120]   You can post them in the chat or you can raise your hand.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.880]   If you have a question.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.800]   Do we have any in the chat?
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.280]   Um, I have one thing to say with, uh, Wayne about that.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.200]   The, um, the SPIAs, I know that Taylor has mentioned that he bought two of them.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.760]   Uh, in one of his posts, he described how he did it.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.360]   The first SPIA that he bought.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.000]   I don't remember how old he was.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.240]   He might've been in his sixties and he calculated, he wrote, he calculated
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.560]   how long he would live probably.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.400]   And he calculated it and he figured, okay, I'll live until I'm like in
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.680]   the, my late seventies, maybe early eighties, if that.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.000]   So he bought the SPIA thinking that it would tide him over.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.360]   He does have a pension.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.320]   Taylor does have a pension, but he needed extra.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.600]   He felt more comfortable, you know, more comfortable having more of a steady.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.280]   Stream of income coming in.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.680]   That would be there for them.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.520]   And so that's when he bought his first one.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.880]   And then of course he kept, you know, he got into his six sixties.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.400]   He passed through his seventies.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.240]   He was in his eighties.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.880]   He figured I'd better buy another SPIA.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.120]   And so he then bought another one.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   And he is now a hundred years old and five months, almost
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.400]   a hundred and a hundred and a half years old.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.600]   And so for some, you know, it, it solved his problem or his
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.960]   wasn't a problem so much, but it solved, it helped him to feel comfortable
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.120]   with the income stream that he had.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.200]   So he did not have to worry about whether or not he took it too much
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.560]   money out of his Vanguard accounts, his retirement accounts or not.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.480]   So that seems to me to be a, a good, you know, a good reason for a SPIA.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.040]   Well, there's a, there's a, definitely a comfort level in
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.040]   having a monthly paycheck.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.440]   I mean, he likely had a monthly paycheck or a weekly paycheck
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.080]   for his entire working career.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.280]   And the switching from that mode of having known income coming in
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.600]   to not having income, maybe except social security, that's a rather big break.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.720]   Having a SPIA can tide you over and make you feel a lot more comfortable
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.480]   with covering the basics of life.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.160]   Your basic expenses are being covered by a known amount coming in.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   And there was comfort in that.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.680]   Uh, lady geek.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   Oh, I just want to say we have three questions in the chat.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.900]   Okay.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.520]   First one, Arctic pineapple corp.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.880]   Love that name.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   Can't remember the name of the writer you spoke of when discussing index annuities,
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.360]   but it, but isn't index annuity with the writer you spoke of parentheses that
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.920]   makes it similar to a DIA parentheses.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.600]   More expensive than just buying a DIA.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.120]   Are the surrender fees greater or longer than a DIA?
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.660]   Okay.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:26.480]   Well, there, if you're using in the use case of a indexed annuity with a
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.920]   guaranteed withdrawal benefit, the, uh, you're using it as a DIA, you're
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.840]   not going to surrender it, so you're using it as a DIA, you're going to,
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.000]   you're planning to turn that into an income stream and so surrender charges.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.040]   Don't make any difference.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.360]   Crediting rates may don't make any difference that that guaranteed
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   withdrawal benefit writer guarantees that based on some phantom account
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.280]   value that's being run within that indexed annuity, that you'll get a
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.280]   certain percent of that every year.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.840]   It is fully guaranteed.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:05.160]   And, um, Stan, the annuity man's website is the only one that I'm aware of where
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.120]   you can actually run quotes on, um, guarantee on, uh, index annuities with
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.760]   guaranteed withdrawal benefits, but you can compare, you know, and you should
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.880]   compare to see if you get a higher monthly income five years from now, or
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.960]   10 years from now using a guaranteed withdrawal benefit on an index annuity
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.800]   or a deal it's very, um, carrier specific circumstance specific, you
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   can't make a general rule about it, but all the Vogel had concerns about indexed
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.520]   annuities, they fall away when you attach that guaranteed withdrawal benefit writer
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.920]   to it, then it's just a question of what's the monthly income that you
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.040]   can get off of that compared to a DIA.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.360]   Okay.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.480]   Let me come back to Bob.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.080]   Let me come back to Bob K.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.480]   Uh, because Kim, I think you kind of slid into Kim's questions.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.240]   Where do you, where do you recommend what purchase an annuity I've
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.080]   heard of standing, standing annuity man and immediate annuities.com.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.040]   And what to look for.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.640]   That's section three, section three coming up.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.600]   I have a full slot.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.880]   Am I okay?
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.600]   Uh, Bob K.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.000]   Uh, what happens if the insurance company goes bankrupt?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.400]   That's a section three.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.600]   Also that's a tree.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.160]   Okay.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.760]   Products.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.360]   Not you don't recommend that'll be in section two.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.720]   Okay.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.920]   Oh, all right.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.680]   Then, then pro and con of cash refund or no cash refund for a SPIA option.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.840]   It just really depends on whether you want to take kind of more insurance risk.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:39.400]   Uh, you know, people will take a refund type option or a period certain option.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.080]   I mean, what happens if you're 70 years old, you buy a SPIA and you
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.280]   die next month with no refund.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.080]   People are concerned about that.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.840]   And so people who are in bad health shouldn't buy SPIAs.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.560]   I mean, the people, I will say as a whole, the population of people that
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.120]   buy SPIAs and buy payout annuities is on average, well, healthier
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.040]   than the average U S population.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.440]   If you're a smoker, you don't buy a SPIA because you're going to die.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.360]   Okay.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.080]   Uh, and, and, uh, so, but, uh, you can also always have the
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.400]   freak accident or cancer or whatever.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.360]   And so it's just kind of peace of mind.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.680]   Um, you're getting the most pure insurance protection by not having
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.800]   any kind of a period certain or any kind of a refund, but, uh, you'll, um,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.520]   maybe have more peace of mind if you have one of those features.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.400]   Okay.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.960]   Mel lady geek, Mel, you have a question?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.920]   Yes.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.320]   Uh, it's a thing about retirement.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.000]   Okay.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.680]   I just needed, uh, Mel, did you call somebody else?
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.880]   Hello, Mel, Mel, it's you.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.080]   Can you hear me?
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.120]   We can hear you.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.280]   Yes, because I just, I just wanted to add to Miriam's
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.000]   comments about Taylor's, uh, annuity.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.400]   Uh, he has expressed a number of times to me and probably others
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.360]   that one of the reasons he really likes the income stream is it makes
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.840]   him comfortable giving his money away now to his children, which is a big
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.400]   thing because you have the option when you give it away to your children
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.000]   to see the benefit of it, uh, as opposed to when they get it after you die.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.200]   So it makes him comfortable giving the money away to his children.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.840]   And that makes him happy seeing the way they're using it.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.280]   Yes.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.640]   He has mentioned that many times on the forum.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.560]   Why don't we go ahead?
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.800]   If I'm not looking at the chat to see if there's other questions out there, I
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.240]   should answer now, but I'd kind of like to go on to the, I just want to introduce
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:55.040]   Mel, Mel Lindauer, one of the founders of the bogleheads.org and posted on the
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.880]   Morningstar forum when we were the Vanguard diehards since 1998.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.480]   Yep.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.240]   Okay.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.400]   Wayne ready for part two, part two, accumulation annuities.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.720]   As I said before, you know, uh, accumulation annuities are literally
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.240]   95% of the annuity sales these days, people buy annuities, what's
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.480]   called annuity for accumulation.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.880]   And there's four kinds of accumulation annuities I'll talk about here going
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.600]   really from the simplest to the most complex, um, a multi-year guaranteed
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.320]   annuity, a MIGA indexed annuities, which at one time were called equity indexed
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.440]   annuities, a buffered annuity, which is a fairly new innovation is also called
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.760]   a registered indexed linked annuity, RILA and a variable annuity.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.640]   So those are the four kinds of accumulation annuities
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.600]   that I'll talk about here.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.720]   Each of those, and this is kind of confusing.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.800]   Each of those is called a deferred annuity because annuitization, the verb
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.760]   or the word annuitization, I'm using that as a conversion into a payment stream.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.800]   It's deferred after the issue date.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.080]   And most accumulation annuities are never annuitized.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.120]   Let me give you an example.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.160]   I have a number of multi-year guaranteed annuities that I've
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.680]   mentioned previously on the forum.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.600]   I own those.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.000]   Um, I do not plan to annuitize any of those.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.880]   I never plan to take monthly payments out of those annuities, but I would
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.200]   have the right to, if I chose to.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.240]   The vast majority of sales are accumulation and the vast majority of
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.520]   accumulation sales are never annuitized, but still they fall in the
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.000]   general category of annuities.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.680]   And so it's a bit confusing nomenclature, but, um, uh, that's, that's the way it is.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.360]   Multi-year guaranteed annuities.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.360]   Half of annuity sales are multi-year guaranteed annuities.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.720]   The rest of all the other annuities is the other half, but multi-year
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.360]   guaranteed annuities are extremely popular.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.200]   At one time there were called CD annuities.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.440]   C is in certificate D of deposit.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.800]   So they are analogous in a lot of ways to a bank CD in that they pay a certain
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   interest rate for a certain period of time I'm going to use as my example.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   You're 5% for five years.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.600]   You can get better rates than that right now, but the math is easy
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.240]   with a 5% rate for five years.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.080]   Um, which is an attractive rate.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.360]   And then when that interest guarantee period expires, you
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.680]   knew it didn't have some options.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.660]   You can stay in the current product.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.560]   The annuity continues on, um, at that time.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.720]   But if the company is offering, it gives him a good renewal offer, maybe
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.880]   another five years at another 5%, he'll take that and leave the money with the
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.760]   company, you can exchange to an annuity with another company if he chooses, or
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.240]   he can take the funds out in cash.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.560]   And so he has options as that five-year period expires.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.960]   Now these annuities are all withdrawable.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.920]   Um, Omega, I can get my money out of Omega anytime that I want, but there
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.040]   are pretty stiff surrender charges and withdrawal penalties on most of the
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.440]   kinds of annuities we'll talk about in this section, and my goes are no
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.920]   exception to that, uh, many migas will have a surrender charge in the first
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.840]   year of six or seven or 8% of the account value, plus a market value
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.040]   adjustment, which can ding you.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:15.520]   If interest rates have gone up since you, uh, bought the annuity, most
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.720]   migas or many migas, uh, free partial withdrawals.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.240]   And so, you know, you can take a withdrawal of often 10% of your prior
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.400]   year account value without any penalty.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.280]   And so you can get access to your funds without penalty, but going
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.440]   above that 10% free partial withdrawal.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.920]   Um, uh, you will, you will not be able to do without, without penalty.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.280]   There's a tremendous amount of variation in my goes between different companies.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.400]   And even within the same company, some companies off my offer, my goes with
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.440]   both no free partial withdrawals and with partial withdrawals, and so you'd
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.640]   need to be darn sure of what you're doing with withdrawals characteristics.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.040]   Uh, when you buy a miga, many mogul heads feel that my goes
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.200]   are a good consumer value.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.000]   Currently, as I said, the most popular kind of annuity, 50% of annuity sales.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.680]   They are the rates that we've had for the last, ever since I've
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.440]   been following my goes, which is about four or five years now, um, have
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.280]   been very attractive compared to comparable things that have a fixed
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.120]   rate for a fixed period of time.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.560]   Like a bank CD, they're attractive compared to bank CDs.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.320]   They're attractive compared to treasuries, um, paying a higher
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.680]   rate and you get your defined amount of money available to you without
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.120]   surrender charge when the five year or whatever period is up, there are no
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.720]   hidden fees, which you see is what you get.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.440]   If a company promised me 5% for five years, I'll get my 5% for five years.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.280]   It allows people to lock in interest rates for a good long period of time, longer
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.160]   than you can get with most bank CDs.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:53.000]   The most, uh, in general, uh, uh, my goes are available between
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.840]   two years and 10 years of maturity.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.520]   The most popular durations for my sales are three years
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.240]   and five years and seven years.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.720]   And, uh, uh, you'll see the largest number of products offered at three,
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.800]   five, and seven, just because that's, that's the way that it is.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.560]   I'll talk about taxes later on, but my guys are attractive as are all
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.960]   accumulation or duties because taxes are deferred until funds are withdrawn.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.000]   And I'll talk about taxes in the, in the third section here, and it's
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.680]   a relatively low agent commission.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   The blueprint income site discloses the agent commissions that they get.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.280]   And they disclose on many annuities that they make one to 3%.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.560]   Now you're not paying that commission directly.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.840]   It's being paid by the insurance company and the insurance company
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.720]   gets its money from, you know, spread that they make, but they're
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.840]   not paying out to you, they're paying to the agent, but that one to 3%
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.040]   commission rate is a fairly low rate compared to some other products.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.680]   And so it's a more attractive consumer value to you because the commission
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.920]   is paid to the agents are fairly low.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:57.440]   So I'm, as I've posted many times in the forum, I'm a big backer of my
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.840]   guys, I always try and tell people the negatives about insurance company
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.080]   insolvency, and we'll talk about that in the third section about the
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.760]   surrender charges and withdrawal fees.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.800]   But for a person who wants, I'm just darn sure they can put away their
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.520]   money for three, five, or seven years.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.960]   Oh, my God, I think is an excellent consumer value.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.720]   We'll go on to index annuities.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.000]   And somebody asked before if there was the kinds of insurance
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.760]   product they don't like.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.200]   And so we've, we've hit the first one here with indexed annuities.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.720]   Um, they pay interest by referring to an external index and it's easiest
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.440]   for me to go ahead and just, uh, uh, talk about the S and P 500.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.120]   You know, you might think if you're buying an indexed annuity, if the S and P
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.800]   goes up by 20%, that you'll make 20%.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.680]   And it does not do that, but it does do, as I say, in the second bullet point,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.440]   it doesn't pay the full index movement.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.640]   It's limited on the upside by caps and participation rates.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:59.240]   A cap is a simple thing that says if the S and P goes up more than 5%, or 4%,
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.280]   or 8%, or whatever it is, you don't get anything above that.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.920]   No matter how much the S and P goes up, you only get a 4%, 5%, 8%, whatever the
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.120]   cap is a participation rate means that you get a certain percentage of the S and P
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.840]   gain, you get 90% or 80% or 50% or whatever it is, and insurance companies
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.160]   can set those caps and participation rates as a part of their pricing.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:29.600]   Um, now in exchange for that upside limitation that you have with the index,
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.520]   you're limited the downside to zero by definition and index annuity cannot
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.640]   have an account value decline year by year based on interest credits.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.840]   If the S and P is down 20%, you will not lose any money because of the 20%.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.160]   You might have writer fees that I'll talk about in a moment, but you will not lose
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.640]   money on the account value itself.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.040]   That that is a absolute with an index annuity.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.320]   Also note that it almost never credits index dividends.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.200]   The policy, the S and P does pay dividends of 2% or so per year, but
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.920]   these index annuities do not pay dividends.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.040]   They only have interest credits.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.360]   Um, I will, I've used the S and P term, uh, a lot here.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.520]   There's a lot, lot, lot more indices than just the S and P 500 that are used.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.000]   And there are actually some custom indices that have been made up back
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.680]   tested to try and illustrate.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.800]   Well, uh, so whatever the index is, is an external index of some type.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.720]   The S and P is the most popular or the most well-known, but there's a
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   lot, hundreds of other indices that are followed by various companies.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.520]   Index annuities.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.920]   One thing that I see as a negative about index annuities is that the
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.840]   caps and participation rates, in other words, kind of the crediting that
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.880]   she'll get on the interest is usually subject to change by the insurance
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.560]   company as often as annually.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.440]   I go back to my MIGA example, my MIGA is 5%, five years guaranteed.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.120]   That's it with an index annuity.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.000]   Often the, uh, policy, uh, cap and participation rate in the
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.120]   first year is guaranteed.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.280]   But after the first year, it's subject to change by the insurance
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.680]   company in its sole discretion.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:09.480]   And then once you, if you're dissatisfied in year two or three or four with how
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.200]   the insurance companies treated you, the products will often have high
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.400]   surrender charges for seven to 10 years.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.320]   Surrender charges can start off with 10% or even more on some products.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.720]   Um, often they'll start off at seven or 8% and then grade down over time.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.120]   And those effectively can, you know, give you a kind of a devil's choice there.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.600]   You go and, um, accept a subpar accredited rate or you, uh, eat a
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.000]   surrender charge and have to pay that out.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.080]   Now, uh, just like on MIGAs, many policies do allow free partial
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.680]   withdrawals of 10%, uh, per year.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.840]   And then withdrawals over that allowance is subject to surrender
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.760]   charges and market value adjustments.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.880]   There are riders that are available on index annuities.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.960]   The most popular one is a guaranteed withdrawal benefit rider that I
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.520]   described briefly in the prior section.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.360]   That, um, it gets a little bit complex as to how to describe this, but
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.560]   essentially what it does is it operates separately from the policy account
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.000]   value to give you a guaranteed withdrawal stream, uh, at an age that
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.920]   you decide anywhere, you know, one year to 20 years after you, uh, by the policy,
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:23.320]   you can turn on that, um, rider and, uh, get a guaranteed, uh, benefit.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.920]   Uh, and, uh, the withdrawals are made from your account value.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.240]   And even if you drain the account value, the guarantee there is that the payments
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.160]   will continue for as long as you're alive.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.960]   Those riders have fees and the fees can pull the account value down in a year.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.240]   A guaranteed withdrawal benefit rider might cost 1% per year.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   And so even if your interest credit is zero, if you have a 1% fee, then your
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.520]   account value would decline by that 1% fee.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.960]   You can also have a guaranteed death benefit, but that's not
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.920]   as popular on a, on a, uh, index.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.960]   Many Bogle heads believe that, um, index annuities are
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.240]   not a good consumer value.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.120]   One of the biggest, um, problems I have is that the insurer can change
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.320]   the bargain every year by adjusting cap and participation rates.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.960]   You buy a policy, you get a big promise going in.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.520]   And then, um, after that, um, there's no guarantee that that promise
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.960]   will be unchanged in future years.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.160]   And you're trapped in the annuity.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.360]   The rider fees can either way at account values, the surrender
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.680]   charges that I've mentioned before.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   Commissions are much higher on index annuities.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.240]   That's one of the things that is almost always true.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.040]   Index annuities will have commissions that are six to 8%.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   Some can be as high as 10%, various bonuses.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.880]   Some can be lower and insurance companies don't print money.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.320]   They do not have printing presses.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.600]   They rely upon, you know, interest that they earn on their
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.400]   funds for generating money.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.320]   And to the extent that they're paying out more money to the agent, then they have
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.640]   less money to pay out the policy.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.280]   So the higher commission you're paying that is being paid on an index
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.080]   annuity is, uh, um, coming out of the consumer's pocket ultimately.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.680]   One of the worst things that I have seen with annuities with index
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.520]   annuities is, uh, being mis-sell mis-sold as an equity alternative.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:17.120]   Anybody who's retired or paid attention to talk radio or whatever might hear
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:22.000]   people talk, uh, financial advisors or agents talk about, um, you know,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.320]   market upside with no downside.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.680]   And those are buzzwords that are used at these free state dinner
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.840]   seminars to sell indexed annuities.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.080]   You know, you can, you can have the upside of the market because
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.720]   nominally it follows at least to a certain extent, yes.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.560]   And P 500 or whatever index, there is no downside, but that's a mis-selling.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.520]   This is an interest crediting product and the interest is determined by an
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.360]   index, but it's not participation in the stock market in any way, shape or form.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.080]   And, uh, one of the reasons I'll just go off of script a little bit here.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.600]   One of the reasons that insurance agents can do this is the training
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:03.000]   requirements for insurance agents are pretty minimal and having that, um,
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.880]   index annuity account value being Florida zero, you can't lose money in a year.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.760]   That makes it so that an insurance agent can sell this.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.720]   If a policy can lose money, like a variable annuity cam, then you
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.960]   have to have a securities license.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:20.680]   And a securities license requires a lot more training, a lot more exams, and
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.160]   there's a lot more responsibility than there is with an insurance license.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.840]   And so that's one reason that index annuities are often pushed by insurance
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.920]   agents as a license is easy to get.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.760]   And it fits into kind of, kind of a loophole where no securities license
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.800]   is required to sell an index annuity.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.240]   So that's my rant against indexed annuities.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:45.600]   Buffered annuities, buffered annuities or, or registered index index linked
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.880]   annuities are a fairly new innovation.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.600]   They also pay interest by referring to an external index and they don't
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.240]   pull the full index movement, but they don't pay the full index movement.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.600]   But the annuitant accepts some downside risk and they get more upside.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.200]   You might make 14% per year, max, but in exchange for that,
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.000]   you have a downside of 10%.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.640]   You'll never have an unlimited downside, but you will have downside.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.600]   So go, so it goes below zero.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:16.040]   Um, the, the, the knocks on this are very similar to the knocks on an indexed
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.160]   annuity, often the caps and participation rates can be changed annually by the
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.120]   insurer and many, they have products, uh, surrender charges for seven to 10 years.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.280]   And most mogul heads feel just as with index annuities that buffered
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.280]   annuities are not a good consumer value.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.720]   That's a fairly small part of the market here, but there have been some
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.520]   companies that have come out with a pretty big splash with some
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.080]   of these, uh, buffered annuities.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:45.560]   Finally, a variable annuity, a variable annuity is a, an annuity where the
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.960]   premium that you pay that the policyholder pays is invested in mutual funds.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.200]   They can be equity, mutual funds, or they can be fixed income, mutual funds.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.080]   They're held by the insurance company.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.560]   And they're drawn from a list of approved mutual funds
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.000]   by the insurance company.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.400]   You can't take the Vanguard or fidelity or whatever mutual funds that you love
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.120]   in your personal account and have those in a very variable annuity.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.840]   If you buy it from company a, you're going to be restricted
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.400]   in your mutual fund choice.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:20.240]   The mutual funds offered by company a under the variable annuity on those
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.760]   annuities, the account value grows or shrinks following the mutual fund
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.400]   performance, it's fairly straightforward on a variable annuity, there are
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.920]   explicit charges that are assessed against the policy for administration.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.120]   Often 1% or so per year writers like guaranteed minimal withdrawal
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.560]   and guaranteed debt benefit.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:44.920]   And then usually excessive mutual fund fees where you can buy a mutual fund
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.400]   from a Vanguard or a fidelity for five or 10 basis points per year.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.440]   That's 0.05% or 0.1%.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.880]   Often the fees on the mutual funds underlying the variable
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.320]   annuities are 1% per year.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:03.280]   So you can end up with a 3% or more annual fee on a variable annuity.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.120]   1% each for administration or the writers and for excessive mutual fund fees.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:13.080]   I think we've had some postings on the forum of people who have a 4% annual fee
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   and you, you know, for, for mobile heads who quibble about, you know, a few
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.720]   basis points or a few 10s of 1% expense rates to pay three or 4% per year.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.600]   It's just borderline.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.040]   I've seen it really is.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.120]   Um, many products have surrendered charges the last seven to 10 years also.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:36.800]   Now many mobile heads seal that most, and I underscored the word most variable
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   annuities are not a good consumer value.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.040]   The high fees and surrender charges.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.600]   They're sold by perspectives.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.760]   There's a hundred page or longer perspectives.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.640]   I'll guarantee you that no mortal human understands every
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.240]   word in that perspectives.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.680]   They're very complex.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.200]   The writer fees can eat away at account values, surrender charges.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.800]   And then again, the, the six to 8% commission is usually
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.360]   paid on annuities like that.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.880]   However, there's an exception to the rule about variable annuities, and that
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.920]   comes with fidelity and other low cost variable annuities, most of you will
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.840]   know fidelity as a, you know, mammoth fund, uh, accumulation, mutual fund
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.640]   company, and they do very well at that.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.160]   But fidelity as a part of its corporate structure also owns a life insurance
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.960]   company, Fidelity investments, life insurance company, and that company
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.000]   offers a stripped down bare bones, variable annuity at very low fees.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.440]   25 basis points.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.200]   That's 0.25% per year is the administration fee, I believe.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.240]   And it goes down.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.000]   If your account value goes up, they have very, um, nicely priced, low
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.240]   priced mutual fund options available under that variable annuity.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.120]   There are none of the fancy writers and such, and there are use cases where
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.320]   it makes sense for a person to keep money in an annuity, like a 10 35
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:58.360]   exchange from a life policy or a, or a, uh, annuity policy and that variable
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   annuity from Fidelity and other low cost providers like that is
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.760]   a attractive place to be.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.760]   Vanguard used to offer a variable annuity like that.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.000]   Vanguard stopped doing that three, four, five, six years ago.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.920]   And now the, the one recommended most frequently on the forum
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.400]   is the, uh, Fidelity annuity.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   So with that, I've covered four types of accumulation or annuities.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.320]   I've given my take, uh, my personal take on all of them is that I like
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.680]   my goes on, I hate everything else basically.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.720]   And, uh, I'm ready for questions.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:30.560]   Okay.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.040]   Questions on the second section of accumulation annuities.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.360]   Anything from the chat?
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:43.200]   Anybody want to raise their hand and ask a question?
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   We did have some in the, in the chat.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.920]   We have questions again on the, um, rating agencies.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.120]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:03.080]   Um, my guys are in their wiki article.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.360]   Let's see.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:19.720]   Um, here's one question for existing purchased products.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:25.440]   Is there a company, a third party that can review it?
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.720]   It can review the purchased product.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.920]   I suppose that would apply to all annuities, whether there is somebody
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.040]   who, um, there are people who can assess life insurance policies,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.760]   whether they are good or not.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.520]   There are people who are,
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.920]   I'm not aware of anybody who does that for, for pay.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.680]   You can come on the mobile head forum and, you know, get, you
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.360]   know, free advice from various folks.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.640]   But I'm not aware of any firm that does that as a matter of business.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.520]   Okay.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.720]   The one thing I can say, Mike, he was the one that posted the question
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:03.360]   is that we used a, a person for our life insurance policy and assessor.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.200]   And he came from the consumer federation of America.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.520]   And I've no law.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.000]   I don't know if he no longer does.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.240]   I don't know if he does that any longer.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:19.160]   And I don't know if he does annuities, but you might Google
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.880]   it because that's how we found.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.240]   Well, I found him through articles, various articles, and he was excellent.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.360]   Analyzing a life insurance policy.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.600]   And this was years ago.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.440]   Um, let me see.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.760]   Well, the other questions from the chat, Wayne, I think are more
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.360]   appropriate at the end, not just.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.600]   I'm not looking at the chat, but I'll probably open up the chat, uh, when,
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.600]   when we get to the end of the presentation here, unless anybody wants
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.600]   to open their, uh, raise their hand right now, we'll just move along.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   And then when we get to the end, it will be open up questions.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.680]   I'll, I'll go ahead and, and then I'll, I'll look at the chat
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.760]   questions too, at that point.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.600]   So for kind of, um, short topics here.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.320]   And I didn't directly address rating agencies here.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.800]   And so I'll talk about rating agencies also at some point.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.360]   How are annuity policyholders protected?
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.600]   Okay.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.640]   People are accustomed to having, you know, on their bank
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.800]   deposits, FDIC insurance.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.440]   The FDIC is, is effectively backed by the federal government, full faith
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.480]   in credit kind of, of the government.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:28.640]   Um, and so the insurance companies are not banks and insurance annuities are
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.120]   not, um, backed by the federal government.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:36.000]   Rather, they're covered by state run life and health insurance guarantee funds.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.480]   What would happen?
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:44.040]   Um, where I, as a, as a resident of Alabama to, um, be unfortunate enough
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:49.440]   to be a policyholder of a company that goes broke, then my state Alabama
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:56.240]   guarantee fund would step in and protect me and provide me with, uh, uh, recovery
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.800]   of under the terms of the guarantee fund act, those are not governmental entities.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.120]   There, there is no tax funding that supports any guarantee fund.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:08.960]   The guarantee funds are supported by assessments, mandatory assessments by
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.600]   the guarantee fund on the insurance companies, for example, New York life.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.920]   I'll use their name.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.760]   Sometimes big, strong, excellent company.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.680]   New York life is, is authorized to do business in Alabama and New York life
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.880]   would be paying into the Alabama guarantee fund to help, uh, put up, uh,
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.920]   the, to make up the hole if my insurance company went in the, in the tank.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.640]   Guarantee fund coverage varies by state.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:38.040]   Most States cover $250,000 of surrender value for insurance company for individual.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.280]   And some cover more, some cover less.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:45.760]   Um, so if I have a multi-year guaranteed annuity for $200,000, I should have full
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.400]   coverage of my surrender value, not necessarily the account value, but the
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.440]   surrender value by my state guarantee fund, one thing to stress with guarantee
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.440]   funds though, is in the event that an insurer fails, it may take years for
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.920]   consumer to get all of his money back.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.480]   I'll contrast that with banks.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.960]   I've never thankfully been a customer of a failed bank, but my impression
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.800]   is that if a bank fails, it fails.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:14.080]   Uh, you know, you go into the bank Friday and it's a failing bank.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.560]   The FDIC examiner is coming over the weekend.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.240]   They take it over, they sell it to a new bank or package it up or whatever.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.800]   And it's opens up for business on Monday under a new name
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.320]   and funds are fully available.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.520]   It's effectively a seamless process.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:33.640]   And the FDIC has gotten very good at, um, taking over failed banks and, uh, making,
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:37.600]   uh, insured depositors hold very, very quickly.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.800]   That's not the way it is with insurance guarantees funds.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.160]   Even in the best of cases, your money might be locked up with the
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:50.560]   company for months, a short number of years, um, just because
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.800]   that's just the way that it is.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.960]   Now, typically in insolvencies, uh, the first thing that happens with
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.880]   an insolvency is a court will move in.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.840]   The court has the right and the ability to, uh, modify.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.600]   Mary, you're not on mute.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.520]   Is it locked?
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.840]   The court has the ability to modify contract terms.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:15.240]   And so I have a right to surrender under my insurance policy, but the
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.560]   court can say in order to preserve the estate, we're not going to
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.120]   allow voluntary surrenders, usually in an insolvency, they give priority
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.400]   to death benefit payments and, uh, income annuity payments, the regular
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.000]   thousand dollar a month payments, but not surrenders, and there's one
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.640]   particular egregious example right now, a company called Colorado bankers.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.200]   That went, uh, that sold my goes, they had a B double plus rating
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.320]   at the time that they went down.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.840]   Their owner is a crook.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:46.200]   He's a, he's a accused and convicted felon bribery, wire fraud, stuff like that.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.040]   But he's also very litigious and he sued again and again.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.520]   And most recently I saw, I think he sued again last week and the
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.720]   company is still not paid out.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.120]   His policy was fully five years later.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:03.600]   The company went in the tank in 2019 and annuity policy holders have maybe
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.880]   had a chance to withdraw some small amount of money, but their money is
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.360]   still locked up in Colorado bankers five years after the insolvency.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:16.720]   So that's a, an edge case, but it is nowhere near as fast recovery as the FDIC.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   So there is coverage provided.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.320]   Their insurance company failures are fairly rare.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.880]   Uh, I'm not aware of any company of any size that went down during the
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:31.080]   2008 financial crisis, which was a terrible thing, even AIG that, uh,
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.960]   had problems, did not have problems with the insurance company that had
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.600]   problems at their holding company.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.640]   And, uh, the entities that did the, uh, CMBS, not at, uh, uh, the, the,
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.120]   uh, the credit default swaps, not the ones at the insurance company.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.000]   I had an AIG life policy.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.280]   There was never a problem with that, but, uh, um, that's not to
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.480]   say that things, bad things won't happen in the future.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   And with that, I might talk just about the rating agencies.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.680]   Let me go back, uh, uh, rating agencies.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:06.040]   Um, every company basically is rated by AM best.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.240]   AM best is a specialty insurance rating agency.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:15.080]   It's been around for, for many, many, many years, uh, more than a hundred
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:19.480]   years, and then make it their business to rate every life insurance company and
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:24.200]   every property gasoline company that they can, and when you see ratings on
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:29.000]   the various agents websites, most frequently you'll see the AM best rating.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.080]   AM best, the very strongest ratings are a double plus a plus plus that
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.680]   is, and a plus, and then down to a and a minus, and then you get into your B
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:43.920]   categories, I can't, you know, as the ratings go down, the risk of default
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.800]   increases, there's been several times, um, several places posted in the, in
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.640]   the forum and if anyone wants to private message me, I can send the text again.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.360]   AMS is put on a table showing the cumulative default rating over a
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.520]   period of 30 or 40 years by rating category, by how long it's been
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.440]   since there was ratings.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.440]   And so people need to make their own best judgments as to, um, uh, what
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.760]   rating they'll find acceptable for a certain period of time.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:17.280]   For me, if I was looking at a SPIA that I expect to pay out for 20 years on my
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.560]   life, I want a pretty high rated company.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:25.920]   I've said publicly in the forum that, uh, for my goods, which I do purchase, I, uh,
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:31.080]   these days would probably not buy a miga from a company rated B double
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.240]   plus or lower, um, beyond three years.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.280]   Uh, I'd want to be in the a category for anything longer than three years.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   Uh, but, uh, that's a personal preference and people need
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.360]   to make their own decisions.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.440]   Insurance company failures are extremely rare, but they do happen.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:50.040]   And now we can talk more about agency, about rating agencies in
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.720]   the chat and, or in the questions.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.240]   Changing tops entirely.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.280]   How are annuities tack?
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.520]   Um, let me make sure I'm in the right place.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.160]   How, how are they taxed?
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.000]   First note that annuities can be purchased through a traditional IRA,
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:12.920]   a Roth IRA, or using taxable funds with a traditional IRA, like any
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.160]   other IRA, all withdrawals are taxable.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:19.560]   And just note that a person can have multiple IRA accounts and the RMDs
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.600]   are calculated over the aggregate of all IRAs.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.320]   I have a Vanguard IRA, but I might have also have a bank IRA and I have
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.480]   IRAs with all the various insurance companies that hold my migas.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.840]   Those are all commingled into one big pot.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:38.040]   I, I have to add it up and come to the total number of my IRAs.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:43.000]   And then, um, when I'm of RMD age, I'll apply the RMD percentage
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.720]   to see how much I need to take out.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.800]   If my, if my RMD percentage was 5%, for example, for a certain year, I do
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.360]   not need to take 5% out from each IRA.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   I can take 5% in aggregate and that's good enough.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:01.960]   So, but, uh, they, the, uh, annuities in an IRA are the same as an annuities,
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:09.000]   same as IRAs at Vanguard or a bank or anyplace else, second, a Roth IRA annuity.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.240]   Very few people from seeing on the forum, I think, but, um, annuities
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:19.400]   in their Roth IRA, but if you do put one in a Roth IRA, all withdrawals
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:24.040]   are taxed or tax-free now a taxable accumulation or annuity, and we'll
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.520]   spend some time on that because this is a little bit more complex.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:33.120]   This will be the use case, say a buying a miga or an indexed annuity and
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.400]   then accumulating money within that.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.320]   It's important to note reporting of taxable income is deferred until
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.600]   funds are withdrawn from the annuity.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.520]   What does that mean?
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.320]   Let's say that I bought a five-year CD from a bank.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:49.120]   Even if I let the money, the interest accumulate in that CD, the bank is
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.000]   going to report interest income to me every year, so whether I get the cash
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.600]   or not, they're going to report taxable income to me every year, insurance
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.280]   companies under annuities don't do that.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.560]   The only way that you'll get taxable income reported to you is if you
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.720]   take money out of the annuity.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.600]   I can allow money to accumulate in my annuity tax defer.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:15.120]   Second thing to note withdrawals are taxed as income first followed by basis.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.080]   Let me give you an example.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.720]   A hundred thousand dollar miga made 5,000 in the first year.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.440]   I didn't want to make a $10,000 free partial withdrawal.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.680]   So I have $105,000 account value.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.040]   The first $5,000 of my withdrawal is taxable income.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.120]   Taxable income comes out first.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:38.560]   Then the next 5,000 of my, of my withdrawal is basis.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.840]   There's no tax on that, but they're taxed as income first followed by basis.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:47.320]   Importantly, the next point, accumulation annuities don't
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.520]   receive a step up at death.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.720]   Therefore annuities defer, but don't do not avoid taxes.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:57.440]   Let's say that I buy my goes and I keep on accruing, accruing, accruing,
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.800]   and never take money out.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:02.440]   And here I am at the time of death with an annuity with a basis of a hundred
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.680]   thousand and an account value of 200,000.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:10.320]   Well, if it were many or most of the kinds of assets that step up from a
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:15.480]   hundred thousand of purchase price to $200,000 of market value is not taxed,
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.080]   but annuities are taxed.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:22.600]   So if I don't pay the taxes, my heirs will no step up a death.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.880]   And that's important for annuities.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:29.440]   That's a big negative, uh, in certain use cases, another negative in certain
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:34.200]   use cases is that all income, even from variable annuities is taxes, ordinary
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.880]   income, again, an example, if I had a variable annuity that happened to have
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.560]   a S and P 500 fund in it, pardon me.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:45.960]   If I wanted to own an S and P 500 fund, if I have an untaxable account, then
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.720]   I'll get the qualified dividends and capital gains, preferential tracks, tax
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.760]   treatment for most folks on the income from my S and P 500 fund.
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.680]   But if that S and P 500 fund is located inside of a variable annuity, there's
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.440]   no preferential tax treatment, all the income from the annuity, no matter
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.560]   what the source is taxes, ordinary income.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.840]   And that's a negative for certain people, uh, in certain situations for using
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.480]   annuities compared to taxable accounts.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.640]   So all these things need to be taken into account when you're considering
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.560]   how to kind of think about taxes as they'll affect your annuity purchases.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:29.480]   Then finally changing topics entirely again, um, to a taxable income
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.880]   annuity that's back to a SPIA where I put it on a hundred thousand dollars
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.080]   and get a thousand dollars a month.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.520]   Part of that a hundred thousand, part of that thousand dollars a month
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.040]   representing the interest part of that is going to be taxable income.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.400]   The rest of it is treated as return of basis and not taxable.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.120]   And the insurance company report to each year, what part of your SPIA
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.720]   payment is taxable and what part is not taxed.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.400]   And so there's a, what's called an exclusion ratio, uh, that is used to
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.680]   determine how much is taxable and how much is not.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.360]   So taxes are an important part of annuities.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.000]   The great thing about annuities is they deferred taxes, but the bad thing
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.200]   is they do not avoid taxes and there's no step of a death and they turn all
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.400]   income into ordinary taxable income.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.640]   Changing topics entirely again, where can I buy an annuity?
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.920]   Now all the newbies are sold through licensed insurance agents.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.200]   You have to have an insurance license, which is not that
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.040]   tough to get to sell an annuity.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.560]   And now there are several categories of places that I've listed out where
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.600]   I've seen mentioned the forum that people buy annuities, the first is what
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.720]   I'll call a multi-company annuity agent that has a big internet presence.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:44.160]   There are three or four of these that are mentioned frequently on the forum.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.720]   These companies will represent dozen.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.560]   These agencies will represent dozens of insurance companies and they'll offer
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.880]   products through all those companies.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:57.960]   My personal favorite website for looking at my goes is blueprint income.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.000]   And the reason I say that is because not the blueprint income services
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.960]   any better, but their website has deeper information on my goes.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.880]   You can get more information on particular products from particular
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.240]   companies on the blueprint site than you can on the other sites.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.480]   I don't know if their service is any better, but their website has more
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.240]   information than the other websites.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.560]   Another website mentioned frequently is Stan.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.440]   The annuity man, Stan is a real person.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.640]   Stan Haycock is his name, and he is an agent who could be a Bogle head.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:34.640]   He's put out a bunch of videos and several books, and he talks and
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.520]   acts like a Bogle head in terms of how he views annuities, you buy an annuity
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.120]   for what it will do, not what it might do.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.680]   You buy it for the guarantees.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.720]   He stresses the, uh, the miga policies, the lower commission
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.360]   policies, and he's a, he's a good man.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.560]   His website also has, um, the only one that I'm aware of where you can
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.840]   get a real live quote on a guaranteed withdrawal benefit on an index annuity.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.200]   And it would be advantage is another agency that I've used personally
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.440]   and I'm satisfied with them.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.000]   And finally, immediate annuities.com.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.200]   That's the website name.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   They're also a well-known one that has a really easy to use a
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.120]   quote engine for getting immediate annuity quotes very easily.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.040]   So that's what I'm calling the multi-company annuity agents that
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.080]   are often mentioned on the form.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.120]   Nationwide, they all write in all 50 states.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.760]   Now there are two well-known companies, well-mentioned companies on the forum.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.840]   There are probably a few others that sell through company employees
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:38.520]   who are also agents canvas annuity, which sells through a company called
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.920]   Puritan life and gain bridge annuity, which sells through a company called
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   gain bridge, they sell through company owned agencies and the interest
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:51.000]   rates that those two places pay are higher than many places on the web.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.440]   But you're not going to find their products at the same rates on
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.320]   those multi-company agent sites.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.040]   You have to go to the canvas annuity website or the game rigid annuity site.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:07.120]   I think that one reason they might have for paying higher rates is because
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.600]   they figure they're saving on the distribution system costs by, by
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.480]   employing their own agents instead of paying commissions out next.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.600]   I'll mention that brokerage firms in particular, I know that fidelity
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.120]   and Schwab broker and limited selection of annuities.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.280]   Typically at those sites, you'll find only the very highest rated
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.840]   companies, the New York life, the mass mutual, the guardian life,
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.520]   USA folks like that are shown.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.640]   And there's a very limited number of products.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:41.680]   You'll also find that for the higher in general, not always a hundred
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.040]   percent true by any means, but in general, the higher the rating of a
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.440]   company, the lower interest rate they pay on their product.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.440]   And so you will not find as high of interest rates on the fidelity
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.920]   website for a certain product.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.160]   For in general, compared to what you'll see on blueprint income.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.040]   I will say New York life, for example, sells on both the fidelity
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.320]   website and on a blueprint income.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.560]   And the, the, I believe that the New York life interest rates are
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.120]   the same between the two, but New York life, because they have such a
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.920]   high rating, they can pay well lower.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.040]   Um, interest rates that now are paid by other insurance companies.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.800]   So fidelity and Schwab broker, a limited selection of annuities.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.320]   Fidelity directly sells a very low cost, very limited.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.720]   I've talked about that already through its company, uh, fidelity, uh,
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.400]   investments, uh, life insurance company, and you can get, uh, application directly
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.920]   to them through the fidelity website.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.600]   Finally, many local agents, uh, your, your garden shop agent
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.520]   around the corner from you.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.760]   They sell annuities.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.080]   Um, they often have a more limited selection.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.040]   They might just represent a few companies and often their products
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.400]   are going to be indexed annuities, which, which many vocal heads
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.120]   disfavor, but you can buy annuities through a local agent, but you're
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.760]   likely to get somebody who really specializes in annuities and as a
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.640]   broader selection of companies that they deal with, if you go with one of
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.560]   the websites that I mentioned in the second bullet point there, so those are
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.800]   the places that you can buy an annuity.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:18.600]   Finally, the last, uh, real, uh, slides here.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.400]   What questions would you ask if you're considering an annuity?
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.720]   What are the kinds of things that you might think about
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.680]   as you're considering annuity?
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.280]   First, are my annuity benefits guaranteed or can they change?
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.240]   Spear the payments are fully guaranteed for life, fully guaranteed
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.640]   with a MIGA interest rates are guaranteed only for, but they're
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.080]   only guaranteed for the initial term.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.320]   You may have to change to a different company after that initial
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.080]   term to get an attractive rate.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.960]   But with indexed credit rates are at the insurer's discretion
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.160]   and the variable product.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.600]   It depends on market performance.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.960]   And so, you know, how important is a guarantee a flat guarantee to you?
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.480]   And, um, just consider what your comfort level is on that.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.360]   Second, what are the penalties for throwing my money?
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.960]   And speed is there's no penalties because there's no right of withdrawal.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.040]   Once you put down your a hundred thousand dollar premium, you're
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.280]   locked into that contract.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.960]   If you've elected one with a, with a refund and then you die, your
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.080]   beneficiaries will get a benefit, but there's no right of you to surrender.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:25.360]   Once the speed is in place, it's in place and there's no right of surrender.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.080]   With my goes index variable, really all the rest of these annuities,
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.760]   you can surrender the policy.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.680]   If you're early in the policy period, you may very well have
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.240]   surrender charges or a market value adjustments.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.960]   Um, and it's important knowing, going in, uh, what those are.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.200]   If you have any indication, you might need to withdraw money.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.480]   What fees will I be paying?
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.880]   Speed is a migas have no explicit fee at all.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.000]   There's no fee, you know, as I've said with both of those things,
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.480]   what you see is what you get your thousand dollar monthly
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.320]   payment on your spia, no fees.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.760]   Are your 5% interest rate in your miga?
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.600]   No fees.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.840]   I know as an insurance company, you know, practitioner and employee, there's an
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.320]   implicit fee buried in there because the insurance company has to make money, has
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.320]   to pay for administration, has to make a profit as to cover risk charges and such.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.880]   And the implicit fee is about 1% per year.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.880]   That is they're paying you as a policy holder about 1% less than
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.000]   they're making on their assets.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.760]   And that 1% spread covers all their costs.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.560]   Index annuities do not have an explicit fee either, but the implicit fee is
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.240]   higher because the commission is high and the, the implicit fee on index
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.360]   annuities is roughly 2% per year.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.720]   So I'm wearing that range.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.120]   Finally, with a variable annuity, there are explicit fees that
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.080]   are laid out in the contract.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.160]   Administration fee, rider fees, the expense charges on underlying funds.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.320]   Then finally, do I understand what I'm buying?
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.720]   Stan Haycock, um, Stan, the annuity man often says, you know, you shouldn't buy
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.000]   an annuity if you can't explain it to a nine-year-old, no events to nine-year-olds.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.560]   So I think a SPIA qualifies as an annuity you can explain to a nine-year-old.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:13.320]   And I think that a MIGA might be an annuity you can explain to a nine-year-old, but
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.600]   can you explain a variable annuity with a hundred page prospectus to a nine-year-old?
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   The answer is no.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:22.560]   Again, you've got to determine your own comfort level on things like that.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.680]   But, um, um, do you understand fully what you bought?
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.240]   It's amazing how little from the posts on the forum that I see people are being
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.360]   pitched on index annuities, especially that they have no frigging idea what
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.960]   they're buying or what the impacts of that are, or what the penalties are or
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.440]   anything else, uh, and it's really important if you're buying a complex.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.880]   Uh, financial instrument, like an annuity that you understand what you have.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.440]   So I will go on and show you.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.040]   There are several wiki articles on the vocal heads wiki
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.160]   about various types of annuities.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.760]   I, uh, when I give the PDF, hopefully these links will be active and you'll
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.200]   be able to click through on the PDF and, uh, get to the, uh, various
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.320]   links in the vocal head wiki.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.600]   And with that, um, and an hour and 15 minutes into the conversation here,
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.920]   I'm done with a prepared presentation.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.880]   Um, I'll open up the chat to look at some of the questions here and
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.840]   then I'll, I'll, um, see what, um.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.400]   Okay.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:29.480]   Miriam, are you, um, got a few questions you want to ask from the chat or let me
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.200]   first ask if anybody wants to raise their hand and ask a question, uh, we can open
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.640]   it up for questions on anything and everything on annuities, personal
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.880]   experiences, if not Jean, do you have from, Oh, Maggie.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.240]   I think that's a good way to go.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.600]   The chat is so variable about statements versus questions.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.920]   It's hard to study a long chat like that.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.800]   Okay.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.440]   Well, if you have questions from the chat, Jean, I'll, I'll take you next.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:57.840]   Okay.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.960]   Uh, I have one or two.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.200]   Okay, good.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.200]   Maggie, let's go to you first with your raised hand.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:11.960]   Maggie, you are muted.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.800]   Sorry.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.080]   Hi, how are you all?
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:16.800]   Thank you for this.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.920]   That was an excellent presentation, very thorough, and I have still
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.320]   probably so many questions, but I just, um, I'm entertaining the
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:29.040]   idea of converting a whole life insurance policy at some point over
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.880]   to a, um, an annuity, because that's what they're recommending, because
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.560]   I do not want to have to pay taxes on the capital gains, but it sounds
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.840]   like I'm going to have to, regardless of how I do it.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:46.920]   So I just wanted to know, uh, if he has any idea of how USAA is with
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.800]   their rates and their performance.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.920]   Well, you've asked about four or five things, the question really, um,
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.440]   first there's no capital gains that are involved with this.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.800]   You use the term capital gains.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.040]   I don't mean to pick at your words there, but when you're talking about
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.520]   income, either, um, income gain on a life insurance policy, surrender,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.040]   or income from a annuity, that's all ordinary income.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.800]   There's no capital gains involved with that.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:20.920]   Uh, yes, if you, um, if you were to do a 1035 exchange, 1035 is a section
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.120]   of the tax code and you can exchange a life insurance policy for an
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.240]   annuity and the basis will carry over.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.880]   So for example, you've paid a hundred thousand in premiums
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.480]   on your life insurance policy.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.920]   The policy cash value is 120,000.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:42.160]   And as you roll that cash value over to an annuity, $120,000 will be, um, uh,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.520]   your account value, a hundred thousand as your basis, and you'll have
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.560]   a $20,000 embedded gain there.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:51.960]   If the money's in annuity, then you will not avoid taxation.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.600]   You will either pay taxes while you're alive or your beneficiaries or
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.080]   heirs will pay them after you're dead.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.200]   Now you can avoid taxation on the gain on the life insurance
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.080]   policy by keeping it till you die.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.760]   There's no income taxation on life insurance death benefits.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:11.680]   And so that's the way to avoid taxes on a life insurance policy is to keep it.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.880]   But if it doesn't make any sense to keep the policy, then, um, an annuity can
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.360]   provide a viable way to defer taxes.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.120]   Let's say you're 55 years old and making a ton of money in a very high tax bracket.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.440]   As you can see a time between when you retire and when you start RMDs, where
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.160]   you will not be in a high tax bracket, an annuity can be a viable way to take
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.480]   the money from your life insurance policy, surrender the life policy, then
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.280]   defer the income for five or six or eight or 10 years and take the income
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.840]   while you're in your low years there, pay a lower tax rate on
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.520]   that, and then lapse the annuity.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.960]   That's a valid reason for an annuity is to defer payment of taxes in the time
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.720]   when you're in a lower or a different tax regime, does that make sense?
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.880]   Yes.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.840]   That's very good advice.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.040]   That's a great way to look at it.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.640]   Sort of a, from a bird's eye view.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.720]   So I appreciate that.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:04.680]   Do you know?
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.000]   Yeah, it's like any other kind of, uh, you know, we, we try and, you know,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.160]   there's a focus on the forum about, uh, taking, uh, taking Roth conversions
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.720]   and taking extra income before you start taking RMDs during your low tax years.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.880]   This is just another twist on the same thing, trying to place your income
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.760]   in years when you can, where your income tax rate is lower.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.000]   Okay.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:30.760]   Understood.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.240]   Do you know much about USAA and their fixed annuities at all?
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.080]   I don't know anything about USAA.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.840]   I know USA is a fine company, very strong, very high ratings.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.680]   I have no negative things to say.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.520]   Um, but they don't sell through blue for an income or those other sites.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.440]   I do see their rates on, um, Fidelity or Schwab or the other, and their rates
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.800]   are consistent with other higher rated companies and they're lower
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.480]   than available on other sites.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.760]   So, but they're a fine company.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.280]   I got nothing bad to say about USAA.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.520]   Wonderful.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.520]   Thank you very much.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.280]   That was an excellent presentation too.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:04.760]   That was
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.240]   Thank you, ma'am.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:11.160]   Wayne, we have, uh, in the iPad, some in, in the questions, I'm sorry.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.400]   A iPad too, made a comment.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.200]   He said, this guy is fabulous.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.920]   I live in Alabama and he would be worth a five hours drive to talk to.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.000]   Thank you for hosting this, this meeting.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   Well, you know, iPad, you don't have to drive five hours.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.960]   We simply have the meetings here on the Vogelheads, Zoom, you know, the Zoom
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.680]   meetings and, um, we'll have Wayne back again.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.200]   The short, the short story on that is, um, back in 2018 or 19, there was a desire
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.680]   for a Birmingham, Alabama chapter.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.560]   And I put my hand up and said that I would chair the thing.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:55.160]   And we started off slow and small and, you know, meeting in the food court at
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.680]   the Galleria and also meeting in my home in the pandemic yet.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.920]   And we switched over to a Zoom meeting format as a lot of chapters did.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:09.000]   And you know, by the time that the pandemic was over and we could meet again, we lost
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.560]   a number of folks in the Birmingham area.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.560]   I picked up some people from elsewhere.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.600]   And so I just kept the chapter going as a Zoom only chapter.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.680]   You can check the U S chapters.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:24.080]   I just put out maybe our next meeting is this coming Sunday at 4:00 PM central time.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.960]   We've got about 12 to 15 people that show up for the meetings.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.280]   Most times it's whatever's on folks' minds.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.880]   And I encourage anybody who wants to, to, you know, either post in that thread or
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.600]   send me a private message and I'll be happy to add you to the mailing list.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:46.720]   And I send out, we meet every two months on Zoom, um, uh, and, uh, at four o'clock
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.160]   central time on a Sunday afternoon.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.680]   And I'll keep the meetings going until God calls me home or until people
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.440]   stop showing up, whichever happens first.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.880]   Well, I think that Wayne, you are much too, um, you know, that there's more to it than
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:09.320]   that, but you run fabulous meetings and more than sometimes there are 45 people at
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.720]   his meetings, they are warm.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.600]   You can ask questions.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.960]   It is what the Vogelheads really are for everybody, people helping other people
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.000]   in all other personal financial matters.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.360]   And the meeting on Sunday is about real estate.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.840]   And he has, um, Birmingham Vogelheads who are very good, no real estate very
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.880]   well, and they're going to speak about the new real estate with the regulations
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.240]   or the settlement about buyers and sellers commissions.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:42.240]   So it should be a very interesting meeting this Sunday.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.000]   Okay.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.520]   Jim, do you have a question?
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.800]   A raised hand question.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.880]   Uh, yeah, this is Carolyn.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.040]   Um, I'm the wife.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:18:00.760]   I just, I didn't hear anything mentioned about cost of insurance, but, uh, we were
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:08.600]   burned by an insurance company, um, where they gave us these illustrations about
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.480]   the minimum we could make and the maximum.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.160]   And we didn't really make anything.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:18.040]   Uh, it was a whole life policy, but it was something else.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:24.680]   Uh, I don't remember it was a long time ago, but, uh, anything with insurance
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.080]   company, I just want to be so careful.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.080]   Uh, I mean, I don't want to have anything to do with insurance companies myself
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:38.600]   because, uh, my father lost a lot of his, he lost most of his money.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.160]   He had a, a, um, an annuity in mutual benefit life.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.280]   And they went under, uh, a few decades ago, maybe in the nineties or eighties.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.200]   It was the nineties.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:59.120]   And I got to say, what you're talking about there is, is highly unfortunate.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.760]   And insurance companies have, uh, often over-promised and underperformed on things.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.560]   You know, the illustration there, there's all kinds of gaming that's been done by
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:17.400]   certain companies in trying to, um, design products to, to, uh, utilize a
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.880]   certain index that makes things illustrate good or cost of insurance charges on
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.400]   universal life policies that are raised.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.360]   And it's really a seedy, seamy, terrible thing.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.400]   I mean, I've publicly said I'm buying my 5% guaranteed for
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.640]   five years and I'll take that.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.880]   I don't like the non-guaranteed elements either.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.760]   Is there anything from, thank you, Carol Jean from the chats.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.160]   I like this one.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:50.280]   Uh, retired teachers have a 403 B with a variable annuity.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.120]   Is this eligible for a 10 35?
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.240]   I might mean 10 31, but I'm not sure.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.440]   10 35 exchange or an IRA rollover.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:12.440]   I would think both, um, first, uh, teachers, unfortunately, oh, if there's,
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.960]   if there's a predatory sales practice, that's been, uh, this happened a lot.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.160]   It's been on teachers.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.240]   Thankfully I am not in that mode and my company was never in that teacher's market.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:27.400]   So I, we were away from the worst of that, but, uh, there's some awful abusive
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.160]   products in the teacher's market that being said, and I'm making up here a
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:37.320]   little bit, but I would think that if it's in a 403 B, it should be surrenderable
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:43.320]   to a IRA and maybe surrender fees there, but it should be surrenderable to an IRA.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:49.040]   I would also think that since it's a newly, since it is, is an annuity, it
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.040]   should be 10 35 to a lower cost annuity.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.760]   If you desire to do that, I would think that's the case.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.560]   I can't guarantee, but I would think so.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.400]   I'm working on that with my niece.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:05.640]   Who's also got a nurse annuity that I think is a 403 B.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.520]   So I'm learning this one myself.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:13.480]   Just look at, look at your charges and look at what kind of annuities there's
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.840]   been some, some abusive behavior with that.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.840]   I'll I'll no other way to characterize that abuse.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.200]   Can I say something?
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.040]   Sure.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.440]   I recognize way.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.920]   Sorry, I, the energy is bad here.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:38.120]   I know my voice is anyway, 10 35 exchange can only be used on taxable accounts.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.200]   You know, of course, of course.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:40.680]   Yes.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.520]   Miriam.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.000]   Thank you.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.240]   Can I use 25 on IRAs, IRAs?
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.440]   You can roll over.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.680]   Remember what IRA means?
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:56.240]   IRA means individual retirement arrangements in arrangement.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:01.040]   You have an individual retirement account and individual retirement
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.880]   annuities, the two types of IRAs.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:13.240]   So either I, if 4143 B it's a employer sponsor retirement account, you should
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.880]   be able to roll that over to IRA.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.240]   I don't see the problem.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.200]   And, and I, I was wrong in saying 10 35, you're right.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.880]   10 35 applies to taxable accounts.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.240]   I would think you could roll it to another annuity, but
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.880]   it would not be a 10 35 exchange.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.400]   It would be a, just an exchange.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:36.160]   Thanks way that answers the question for my niece.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:43.600]   So next question, any opinion on long-term care annuities?
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.760]   I haven't heard of these.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:51.080]   Um, there are, um, long-term care.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.960]   Um, is it really troubled insurance product sold by many companies years ago?
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.960]   The actuaries didn't know quite how to price it.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.360]   And so traditional standalone long-term care is really
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.040]   not very available these days.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:11.000]   Um, the, uh, way that the insurance industry has tried to respond to that
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.200]   is by putting long-term care riders on annuities or on life insurance to
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.600]   have a pot of cash that can be used for either annuity purposes or for
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.080]   long-term care, I'm not a big fan of those.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.320]   I'm not really deep into those.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.520]   And so I don't want to express too strong of an opinion, but, uh, I think
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.200]   you're better off outside of an insurance product that's, uh, really
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.280]   not meant for long-term care, but you can look at those things.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.720]   So, um, I don't have a strong opinion in one way or the other.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.120]   Okay.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:46.240]   Um, Wayne, one question that came up in the chat is that you have ratings,
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.640]   the rating system for companies, insurance companies.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:55.080]   Are, is there a rating system for the products, the products?
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.560]   In other words, like mutual funds, you can find out whether certain mutual
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.480]   funds really are highly rated or not.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.520]   How about for these insurance products from these different companies?
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:10.320]   No, there is, there is no, uh, there's no, um, um, rating agency or rating
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.720]   firm that rates insurance products.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:18.240]   If you Google, you can see some really superficial reviews out there on the
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.080]   internet on certain annuities, but they're so superficial to be worthless.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:26.520]   So no, there is no, um, it's, it's doing your own due diligence or, you
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.000]   know, posting on the forum and getting the opinions of other people about this
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.440]   particular product versus that product.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.360]   That's too bad, but it's the case.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.760]   Is there a, an annuity forum?
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.280]   I know there is a teacher's forum.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.520]   I visited the teacher's forum.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.600]   Uh, very nice.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.120]   Some Bogle has run it for teachers and their finances, but what about, uh,
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.080]   you know, insurance products or, uh, annuities in particular?
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.240]   Is there a, I'm not aware of it.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.640]   No, I'm not aware of anything.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.120]   Okay.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:01.520]   Um, on the ratings of the companies, we do have some questions on the companies,
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.880]   how they rate these, I'm sorry, how the rating companies rate the insurance
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:13.720]   companies, and you mentioned that the ratings, um, the insurance companies
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:19.800]   have different products and the ratings do not necessarily cover each, do I get
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:25.960]   it right, the entire insurance company AIG being an example that they had
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.160]   trouble in one area, but not in another area.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.840]   And we had a relative, actually, we had, uh, an insurance policy from
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.160]   bankers like, and I understand that they had difficulties, but they had
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.600]   no trouble with their insurance.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.120]   Uh, difficult.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.200]   They had no insurance difficulties, even though the company had difficulties.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   Um, insurance companies are a legal organization unto itself.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:56.240]   Um, and the ratings applied by AM best, none of the other agencies,
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.080]   standard and poor's and Fitch and Moody's.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:04.080]   They're providing a variety of ratings, but they're rating the financial
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.800]   strength rating or the claims paying ability of the insurance entity.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:12.920]   In the case of AIG, for example, AIG life insurance company and American
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.000]   general life insurance company and variable annuity life insurance company.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.480]   They were all part of the AIG group.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:22.120]   They are owned by AIG corporation.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.720]   Some, you know, some, maybe two, two levels upstream or three
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.920]   levels upstream or whatever.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:33.800]   Um, and the insurance companies are regulated by the state insurance
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:36.760]   regulators who have fairly tight controls over the company.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:42.440]   The insurance regulators, for example, have the ability to, um, to, uh, set,
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.840]   uh, invested asset limits, concentration limits.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.760]   Um, they require fairly stringent financial reporting.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.880]   They can, um, deny dividends being paid out of the life insurance company.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.640]   So it's not uncommon.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.920]   I think bankers life.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.560]   I think that was part of the Conceicao group.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.400]   Uh, Conceicao went, went broke, but bankers life, the insurance company
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.320]   owned by Conceicao did not go broke.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.040]   Same thing with AIG, AIG real problems, but the AIG life companies did not.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.280]   Um, does that answer your question?
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.000]   I'm trying.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.120]   One thing it means is that if you hear on the news, something
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.000]   about your insurance company, you don't have to panic.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.320]   You, you, you examine further what happened.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:30.360]   The insurance regulators are, are very much.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.960]   And then I'll talk to the rating agencies, the rating agencies.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:40.680]   Those rating agencies are, um, examining the there's, there's frequent
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:46.680]   contact between the insurance company and the rating agencies every quarter.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.120]   A full set of financial reports and usually additional supplementary
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.920]   interrogatories is sent from the insurance company to the rating agency.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:57.080]   So they have a full open view.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.960]   Um, I was the primary contact with the rating agencies for part
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.640]   of my time at the company.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.760]   And, uh, they would each come to our offices once a year and want to sit
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.360]   down with the CEO and the CFO and the chief investment officer and the
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.720]   chief people officer and those kinds of things to see face to face
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.720]   eyeball to eyeball what's going on.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:25.440]   Um, they have the right to, um, make special requests at pretty much any
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.760]   time of the company as to what to do.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:34.160]   Um, they also, when they rate a company, having adequate capital, strong
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.120]   capital is by no means the only thing required for a strong rating.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.120]   You need to have a good depth of management.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.480]   You need to have a good diverse marketing plan.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.640]   You need to have good, um, asset liability controls.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.160]   You need to have good risk management.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.720]   You need to have all kinds of things in order to get a good rating.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.360]   Insurance rating agencies also value diversity of business.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:57.640]   They don't like a company.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.560]   It's term life insurance only or migas only.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.080]   They'd much prefer a company, very diverse lines of business where
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.120]   it can be offsets or something is down in one side and it's up in the other.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.520]   So they prefer that.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:15.440]   And so the higher ratings will go to companies that have by definition,
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.840]   strong capital, but also have strong management, strong marketing plans,
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.520]   maybe strong brand names if they're a national company.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:28.760]   So, so those kinds of things, um, that it's a rating agencies
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.680]   don't always get it right.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.440]   You know, there are times for companies that are, that
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.480]   are well-rated do fail.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.160]   Colorado bankers had a B double plus rating from AM best
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.400]   before they went in the can.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.880]   So it does happen.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:46.120]   Um, but, uh, the rating agencies certainly try to stay abreast of things
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:52.080]   and, and, uh, come down once a year and then update their, they take their
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:56.600]   ratings into the analyst to a report back to a committee, the committee
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:00.720]   will decide based on slotting this company in with the rest of their
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.320]   universal companies, how does this company fit into that slot, uh, compared
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:09.000]   to other companies that are pure companies, it's a fairly intrusive process.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.440]   Very interesting.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:15.600]   One question in the chat was, is there a real difference between a
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:22.520]   rating of a plus a B plus plus B minus, et cetera, is there much of a
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:29.600]   difference between an eight plus and a B minus, a significant one that we would,
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.920]   um, that would cause us to not buy a product, for example?
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.760]   Yes.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:39.680]   I would, I've said on the forum personally, I'm not going to buy a
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.320]   policy from a B from a B plus company.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.080]   That's just too low.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:47.720]   I would restrict my purchases of my goes with B double plus
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:51.760]   companies to, uh, to, uh, uh, three years or less.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.440]   I just don't want to take that risk.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:31:01.320]   Other people can vary, uh, trying to think I might go and amend the, uh, or
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:05.840]   append onto the slide presentation, the, uh, ratings thing from a and best.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:11.120]   If I can figure out how to get it in there, showing the default by, um, by
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.360]   rating category and by years of exposure.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:19.160]   For example, if a company is rated B plus on a certain date, what's the
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:22.840]   chances of default in one year, in two years, in five years, in 10 years.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.960]   Now, of course we don't operate on averages.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.120]   We operate on a policy on a company.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:33.000]   And so, you know, there've been very, very few insurance defaults, but,
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.680]   um, you know, things do happen sometimes and companies do go down sometimes.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.200]   So, uh, yes, I would not buy it from a B plus company.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:45.280]   I'd buy if it was New York life, which I regard as the king of the industry.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.800]   I'd buy an any amount.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.960]   I mean, New York life actually has a, has a rate band.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.920]   You can get a higher rate on Omega if you put $10 million with New York life.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.840]   And I don't have $10 million, but if I did, I'd feel comfortable
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.720]   with New York life's credit.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.600]   Interesting.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:07.240]   Any other questions, any raised hand Jean from the chat?
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:08.760]   From the chat.
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:16.320]   Can there be an annual withdrawal rider on a SPIA for small emergency cash needs?
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.840]   Not to my knowledge.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.320]   You'd have to ask an agent about that.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.520]   Not to my knowledge.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.640]   Let's be a, you got what you got.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.920]   That's kind of what I guessed.
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:31.120]   And then another question, what would be a use case for buying an
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.000]   annuity with an IRA other than a QLAC?
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   Well, I will say, as I've said on the forum publicly that I have
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.880]   almost all of my Amigas in my IRA.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:47.960]   And the reason is because I personally and others on the forum will disagree,
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.680]   but I like the certainty of knowing that I will have, you know, X thousand
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:57.360]   dollars available from this Amiga in 2027 from hell or high water.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.800]   Now I don't need the money until 2027.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.920]   And so I'm happy deferring until that date, but I don't with a bond fund.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.440]   If I put money into a bond fund today, I don't know what
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.640]   it would be worth in 2027.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:11.880]   I know what my, my Michael will be worth in 2027.
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.480]   So tell her me silly.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:19.560]   I like the certainty of the known amount of principle that I'll
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.360]   have at a certain future date.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:26.640]   You can get that same certainty with other things like individual bonds,
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:33.000]   individual treasuries, uh, defined maturity ETFs, bank CDs.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]   Those all have those same characteristics.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.640]   I find that usually the migrates are, are attractive compared to
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.200]   the rates available elsewhere.
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:48.880]   So yes, it's, it's like any other fixed cum fixed income within a, um, IRA,
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.640]   which I think typically is where Vogel had say, you ought to put a lot of
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.720]   your fixed income is in your, your IRA.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:00.560]   I like an annuity in an IRA because of the, um, because of the characteristics.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:04.800]   The only unknown factor in that is inflation, right?
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:07.640]   Well, you have inflation everywhere, right?
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.440]   It's the bond fund is the same type of thing.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.440]   Yeah, sure.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.400]   Very similar.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:14.920]   Okay.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.760]   Miriam, back to you.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.960]   You got another one out there?
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.600]   Do any raised hands?
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.080]   Anybody in the audience want to ask a question?
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.320]   We do have a question in the chat from Gorey.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:34.640]   He says, he asks Wayne in general, Wayne, uh, do you think annuities are
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:42.040]   underutilized by folks who have sufficient assets and they have
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.120]   sufficient non-annuity income sources?
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:51.560]   Meaning if you don't need an additional income source, is there still a
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:58.160]   benefit from a cost-efficient perpetual optional income source with an annuity?
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:05.520]   Or is it simply better that annuities are for folks who need that income source?
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.760]   You used the word sufficient about four times there.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:16.480]   And so with that, I'd say probably not, you know, I wouldn't buy annuity.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.600]   If I just simply had no need at all, if everything else was sufficient and I
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:23.960]   was highly confident that it would be, then I, then I wouldn't do it.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:30.080]   But I think, uh, uh, plumbing use cases for annuities is as people, you know,
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.480]   the, uh, retirement system in this country has moved increasingly to a
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:40.560]   defined contribution retirement system where people have their IRAs and their
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:47.720]   401ks and, uh, being able to easily, seamlessly cost-effectively convert
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:51.320]   that lump of money into a monthly income.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.840]   Might be attractive for a whole lot of folks.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.640]   And to have that as a second stool of your leg, a second leg to your stool.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.840]   Right.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:08.200]   It's like you're creating, it's like creating your own pension.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.440]   Yeah, it is.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.480]   It's creating your own pension.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.080]   And, and, uh, hopefully over time there'll be more, um, more
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.080]   people that have that access.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.120]   Simon, do you have a question?
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.480]   Simon, you're, you are muted.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.480]   Okay.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.560]   Thank you, Wayne.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:32.480]   Um, my question is about guarantee fund coverage.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:40.840]   Uh, my state, uh, has limits that differ for an annuity in accumulation
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:47.240]   mode versus an annuity in, uh, in payout mode and the surrender value.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.880]   Well, they talk about the limit of coverage by the guarantee association.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.200]   Um, and they still use the word surrender value.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:01.280]   Um, what, what would be the estimation of a surrender value for something
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.760]   that's been in payout mode for 10 years?
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.160]   Um, I'd have to see what state it is.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.200]   I'd be surprised if they used surrender value in connection with a payout
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.320]   annuity, because there is no surrender value on a payout annuity.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.440]   Right.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.280]   But I think what they would, I don't have, thankfully I've never been an
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.640]   employee or worked on an insolvency, so I can't tell you exactly how they do it.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.200]   But it would seem to me that, uh, what they would do if, if for policyholders
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.800]   who had payout annuities of, uh, an insolvent company is that they would
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:39.320]   do evaluation of those annuities using kind of first principles, you know,
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.440]   what's the present value using actual principles of a stream of a thousand
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.200]   dollars a month for a person who, for a male age 75, you know, whatever that is.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.480]   And that's how they would come to the value that's
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.680]   covered by the guarantee fund.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.320]   It is not uncommon.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:58.720]   It's it is common for there to be different dollar amounts of coverage
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:02.360]   for payout annuities and for accumulation or news that's common.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.160]   Thank you.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.240]   Um, I'll, I'll go back and read it more carefully.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:07.640]   Thank you.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.560]   And Jean.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.280]   Um, I've got one from the chat.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.440]   Does cost of insurance allow insurance companies to take
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:21.000]   most of the interest earned away?
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:29.280]   Well, the cost of insurance would not apply to a, um, a, uh, annuity.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:33.880]   Uh, the only kinds of things that are even remotely close to a cost of
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:39.680]   insurance would be writer fees on an annuity cost of insurance that term
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.080]   is used almost exclusively when you're talking about life insurance and
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:48.920]   specifically universal life, universal life has explicit cost of insurance
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.880]   charges and the relationship of cost of insurance on a universal life
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.560]   policy to the interest just really depends upon what is the amount of
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.960]   insurance that you have and what's the amount upon which you're earning interest.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.040]   You know, so there are two entirely separate concepts.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.160]   The interest earned is the amount earned on the account value.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:13.120]   The cost of insurance is based on your age, sex, and amount of insurance.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:18.040]   And the two can be very close to the same or dramatically different,
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.760]   but there's really no linkage at all between the two.
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.400]   They're two separate concepts, but that applies to life insurance,
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.400]   universal life, not to annuities.
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.320]   Excellent.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:28.920]   Wow.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.440]   You really know your stuff.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:33.680]   43 years.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.760]   It shows.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:36.600]   Thank you, Wayne.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.440]   Good job.
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.800]   He likes the Vogel head for him.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.600]   Cause he has an opportunity to get, you know, talk about all this stuff.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:49.720]   Well, I'll tell you, uh, as pure mortals out here who came along later in life
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.240]   and tried to figure this out, we appreciate it, Wayne.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:52.800]   Good job.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.760]   Um, Wayne, I must, must say that, um, Melinda has posted on the chat.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:05.320]   A very nice, um, he says outstanding presentation, Wayne.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:12.360]   Thanks so much for being an experienced straight shooter in an industry that's
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.120]   right with misinformation to enhance sales.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.760]   That's very nice.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:19.240]   Thank you.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.760]   But in closing, I'll say that, you know, I didn't know what I was
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.120]   going to kind of do in retirement.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.640]   I'm five and a half years into retirement here and didn't
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640]   really have kind of a passion.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:34.920]   I found I get personal enjoyment and satisfaction from being able to answer.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:38.120]   And the best way that I can things that people post.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:43.240]   And so I'd encourage anybody I, as I said at the start, I do try and
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:47.840]   weigh in on most, all the annuity threads on most, all the life insurance threads.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:52.160]   And if you want my input, either send me a private message and give me a heads
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.760]   up about a particular thread or send me a private message with your particular
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:01.880]   situation, my, it's a kind of a purpose that I have, and, and, uh, I hope that
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:05.960]   it's, I think it's been useful to a few folks and I hope to do it for a good while.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:14.840]   Um, one other possibility, possible use of an annuity is where I've read that.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:19.200]   Let us say that we are, you know, younger and we are taking
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.960]   care of our elderly parents.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:31.720]   And we have ourself the possibility of dying earlier than our parents,
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.240]   but we are taking care of them.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:41.040]   In other words, to use it as to buy an annuity for them, you buy an annuity for
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:47.360]   them so that if you pass away earlier, at least they have an income stream for them.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:52.840]   Now there's also life insurance, of course, but what is, um, what would you say about that?
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:59.520]   Well, you know, that would probably not a way you could structure that would be as
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:05.160]   part of your will to direct your will or your trust or whatever, I'm not an attorney
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.800]   by any means to buy an annuity on your parents at that point, it'd probably be
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:15.600]   less effective to go and buy one on you as you're a youngish person and to have
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.200]   it being paid out when you don't need the income, if your goal is to try and
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:24.920]   help out your parents, um, after your death, but it would be, it would be a way
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:30.480]   of doing things to direct that you're in your will, that part of the, your estate
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.840]   will be used to purchase an annuity on your parents.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:36.640]   That's that again, that there may be twists and turns there that I don't
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.360]   understand, but just in terms of raw kind of actuarial and mathematical
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.880]   things, that's a way that you.
