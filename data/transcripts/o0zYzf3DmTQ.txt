[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Well, do angels walk among us today?
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.460]   It's a classic Bible question and one we haven't tackled yet on the podcast until today.
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.720]   A listener named Courtney writes in with the question, "Hello Pastor John, thank you for
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.720]   this podcast.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920]   My question is about Hebrews 13.2.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.080]   Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.860]   I've read this text often and wondered what it means.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.800]   Does it mean angels are walking among us in human form right now and we are unaware of
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.800]   them?
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.480]   Pastor John, how would you answer Courtney?
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.760]   Let me give some background about angels in general, and then I will give my answer in
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.440]   the context of that wider picture.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.200]   First, here's a glimpse of the activity of angels in the Old Testament.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.480]   Judges 13.3, "The angel of the Lord appeared to Samson's mother to be, and said to her,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.760]   'Behold, you are barren and have not born children, but you shall conceive and bear
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.760]   a son.'"
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.160]   Psalm 34.7, "The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him and delivers them."
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.240]   Psalm 91.11, "He will command his angels concerning you and guard you in all your ways."
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.720]   Daniel 6.22, "My God sent his angel and shut the lion's mouth."
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.920]   Psalm 103.20, "Blessed the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.480]   the voice of his word.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.920]   Blessed the Lord, all his angelic hosts, his ministers who do his will."
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.180]   So it appears from the Old Testament that angels are messengers from God.
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180]   They are protectors of God's people.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.320]   They do countless obedient things in response to God's bidding.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.120]   Now when you come to the New Testament, and it begins, there's a great flurry of angelic
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:17.480]   activity surrounding the birth of Jesus in Matthew and Luke, and then there's some activity
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.280]   of angels during the life of Jesus.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.080]   And then in the book of Acts, angels rescue Christians from prison twice.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   They guide Philip to the Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920]   They guide Cornelius to Peter.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.360]   They guide Peter to Cornelius.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.480]   They kill Herod.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.400]   They remind Paul on the ship that he's going to make it to Rome.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.520]   And then you turn to the letters of Paul and James and John and Peter and Jude, and there's
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.640]   virtually no teaching about the function of angels in our present experience as messengers
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.840]   and protectors or guides.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.480]   And I just stand back and say, "That's amazing.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   That's amazing."
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.040]   And the least it can mean, it seems to me, that all those letters have no teaching about
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.120]   the present experience of angels in our lives, the least it can mean is that the teaching
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:25.080]   about angels and how they serve Christians now was simply not essential for us to know.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.720]   That's my conclusion.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.600]   And my own guess about the reason for that is that the promise that the Lord Jesus himself
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.360]   would come to us, "I will not leave you as orphans.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.520]   I will come to you," and would be with us to the end of the age, Matthew 28, 20, and
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.720]   that he would give gifts to his church and that he himself would build his church so
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.240]   that the gates of hell would not prevail against it.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.720]   Jesus is doing that, not angels.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.840]   He says all of this teaching about the immediacy of Christ himself in this age, along with
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:10.600]   the presence of the Holy Spirit, is so overwhelming, glorious, that it has preempted any prominent
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.440]   place that angelic activity in the lives of Christians might have.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.080]   Now, careful, to say that there isn't a prominent place or that the knowledge about
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.120]   them isn't essential does not mean there's no place.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.960]   And the book of Hebrews, from which this question is coming, is the place where the most pervasive
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.520]   answer to the question, "What are angels for?" is given.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.240]   And it's Hebrews 1, verses 13 and 14, which goes like this, "To which of the angels
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.840]   has God ever said, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   my feet'?"
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   In other words, there again, you have the preeminence of Christ over against angels
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.600]   being highlighted.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.400]   But then he says, "Are they," namely angels, "Are they not all ministering spirits sent
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.280]   out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?"
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.640]   Now that too is an amazing statement.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:26.480]   Angels are ministering spirits sent out into the world by God, now in this age, to serve
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.320]   for the sake of Christians.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.080]   In other words, everywhere that angels are active in the world, doing whatever God assigns
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.720]   them to do, it is for the sake of making everything work together for the good of Christians.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:52.920]   But notice, the writer of Hebrews doesn't draw any explicit inferences from angelic
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   ministry for our behavior, nor does he anywhere else in the book of Hebrews.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.280]   The closest to it would be the text that Courtney refers to when she asked this question in
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:14.440]   Hebrews 13.2, which says, "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.880]   some have entertained angels unawares."
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:27.440]   Now, most commentators think this is a reference to the time that Abraham entertained three
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.760]   angels in Genesis 18.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:39.600]   But whether that's the case or not, the point of the verse is that since, in fact, angels
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:49.180]   have been shown hospitality without the host knowing it, therefore don't neglect this crucial
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.840]   ministry of showing hospitality to strangers, especially Christian strangers, people you
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   don't know.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   And that is the point.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   You don't know them.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.440]   If you knew them, you'd know that they weren't angels.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.840]   These are strangers.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:13.500]   So I think the answer to Courtney's question is, yes, there are angels among us.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.380]   They might take the form of a stranger who needs your hospitality.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:27.580]   The point of saying that is to raise very high the enormous importance of Christians
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.420]   being generous with our homes.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:39.220]   But keep in mind two amazing things that should keep us back from an unhealthy speculation
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.380]   about angels coming to our homes.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:50.940]   One is that Jesus already gave a much more amazing incentive for hospitality than this
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.540]   text does.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:59.780]   He told the parable of the final judgment when the Lord said to those on his right hand
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:07.740]   that had shown him hospitality, "Lord, when did we see you a stranger and welcome you?"
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.940]   And the king will answer them, "Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.340]   of these my brothers, you did it to me."
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:26.020]   Which is greater, to welcome a Christian pilgrim and find that it was an angel or to welcome
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.020]   a Christian pilgrim and find that it was Christ?
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:37.260]   And the second amazing thing to keep in mind is that three verses later in Hebrews 13,
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:45.500]   5, when the writer encourages us not to worry about the money that we might spend on hospitality,
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.140]   he does not say, "Oh, the angel will take care of you."
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.300]   He says, "Keep your life free from the love of money.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:01.060]   Be content with what you have, for he, for God in Christ, has said, 'I will never leave
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.300]   you.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.220]   I will never forsake you.'"
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.000]   Not angels will never leave you.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.100]   So we can confidently say, "The Lord," not angels, "The Lord is my helper.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.340]   I will not fear what can man do to me."
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.700]   So the New Testament position seems to be this.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.060]   Angels are real.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.620]   They are sent into the world for the sake of Christians.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.900]   You might entertain an angel without knowing it.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.540]   But vastly more important is to grasp that Christ is among us.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.140]   Christ has promised to take care of us.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.020]   Christ will never leave us or forsake us.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.760]   Christ may be entertained in the person of a believer, and therefore the Christian life
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:53.120]   should be 100 times more oriented on Christ than on angels.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:00.320]   And for his sake, for his sake, our homes should be open.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.240]   That is a fascinating Christ-centered take on this very common Bible question.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   Thank you, Pastor John and Courtney.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.520]   That is a great Bible question.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.080]   Thanks for sending it in to us.

[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.080]   Well why are we so content to go prayerless?
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.740]   Or maybe to ask it another way, what is it that motivates our prayer lives?
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.120]   What can sustain us here?
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.440]   What breathes urgency and jumpstarts our intercession?
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.820]   This seems like such a relevant topic for every Christian to ponder, and we will.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.120]   Next time, I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.180]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.520]   See you then.
