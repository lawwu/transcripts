[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Why do you always go Christopher Walken whenever you do these
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   outros? Why do you do that?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   Thanks for listening to the all in podcast. Wow. David Sachs
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.600]   poignant points about regulatory capture. Freeberg loves mock
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:26.680]   meats. Not for me. Everyone loves a great day. See you next
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:38.280]   time. podcast. Wow. Love you boys. So you're better. Everyone's

[00:00:43.260 --> 00:01:03.620]   coming on. I'm coming on. Rain Man David Sachs Hey, Freeberg,
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.100]   you want to tell them about your new family members? Oh my god.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.940]   Did he get more dogs? Is he trying to date Fortnoy this
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.020]   again? Oh, Miss peachy. So I'm like working all day Friday. I'm
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.460]   like wiped out. I've been in I can't remember. I was in Santa
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.220]   Cruz. I made it all the way back up through the traffic. I get up
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.860]   to the house. I've been texting and calling all afternoon. No
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.740]   response. I'm like, what the fuck is going on? Normally,
[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.340]   she'll text me like just walk through the door, open the door
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.900]   to my car, every little thing. So for her to not be calling me
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.700]   back and something's up. I walk in the house. The kids are
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.300]   there. They're jumping up and down. Daddy, Daddy, we got two
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.940]   new dogs. And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? We
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.740]   didn't get two new dogs. What do you say? Mommy's got two new
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.300]   dogs. And then mommy took him to the vet. She'll be back in a
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.180]   few minutes. I'm like, no way. And I had some friends coming
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.820]   over for dinner. They walk in the house. The kids are jumping
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.740]   up and down. Two minutes later, walks in the house. These two
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.860]   dogs that someone found in a parking lot in San Jose, and
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.060]   they couldn't find a home for these dogs. And they were like,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.140]   the dogs don't have a home. decided I'll take them into my
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.220]   home. And I'm like, you This is why you didn't call me. You
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.180]   didn't text me. I walked out the room. I'm like, it's over. It's
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.860]   been nice knowing you. The kids are screaming, Daddy, you can't
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.980]   get rid of the dogs. There are dogs. Now these are the best
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.580]   dogs. So now we have four dogs. And which was the vet bill. And
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.460]   then I come down that night, huge in the dining room, like
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.620]   multiple diarrhea, plopped all over the floor. I walked
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.060]   downstairs, the whole house was smelling of poop. My house has
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.420]   become like, you know, those carnival trains that used to go
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.260]   from city to city back in the 19th century. If one of those
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.980]   trains like fell over and spilled open, that's basically
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.740]   what my house has become. It just smells like poo and hay. And
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.260]   there's clowns and children running around. And I live in
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.220]   there ever tell you the story of Chuck Norris the Chihuahua? No,
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.300]   no, no. So I'm going to a wedding. I'm in like Arizona.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.300]   I'm driving like on one of these giant, like Arizona streets and
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.300]   a chihuahua runs across this like eight lane boulevard,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.140]   whatever. And I'm like, Oh my god, I'm like dodging around it
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.660]   and it goes into the other side of traffic and I see a car. And
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.380]   he just the dog ducks, he misses the car. I'm like, Oh, thank
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.220]   God. My wife is screaming her head off. The dog gets whacked
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220]   by another car and it goes rolling down the highway. I make
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.500]   a u turn, I block it. The dogs knocked out on the side of the
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.980]   road. I run up to the dog, I pick it up. I'm like, this dog's
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.700]   gonna die. We don't I get in the car. I said, Let's just take it
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.100]   to a vet or whatever. And I'm saying goodbye to the dog. The
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.220]   dog's like looking up at me. It's in bad shape. We go to a
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.500]   vet. I gave it to the vet. We go to the wedding. My wife who was
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.140]   like, got this big heart decides she's going to stay with the
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.620]   dog. So I go to the wedding. I go to the you know, opening
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.260]   night party. She's with she's at the 24 hour event, sitting with
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.540]   this dog waiting for it to die in hospital. Oh my god, the dog
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.380]   doesn't die. survives. Now it's Monday. And I get the alert on
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:18.740]   my credit card. $12,000 Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, $1,000 on this
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:25.060]   dead dog. I'm like, the dog survives. I bring the dog back
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.980]   to the Bay Area. The dogs find I can't believe it. But you know,
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.100]   it's got like a broken leg, all this stuff. But you know, he's
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.860]   generally he's the dog's alive. So I put him on social media.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.820]   I'm like, anybody want Chuck Norris, a dog that cannot die.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.540]   This is like the toughest chihuahua you ever seen. Some of
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.700]   these rich people in San Francisco living on like a
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.860]   certain street, Broadway or something like that turns out
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.620]   there like their heirs to something famous. They live in
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.700]   like three states, they got a private jet, all this nonsense.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.980]   They say we'll take the dog. They're friends with a couple of
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.140]   our mutuals. So I'm like, this is great. I'm going to get the
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:15.180]   12 grand from them. Because they got a private jet, they got
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.500]   three houses. So they come down to pick up the dog with their
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.980]   driver and everything. And we're delivering the dog. And I tell
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.420]   Jade, hey, can we let them know about the $12,000 bill? Maybe
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.940]   they'll pick it up. Like a Larry David. And my wife is like, if
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.420]   you bring that up with them, I'm divorcing you. We have to pay
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.580]   the 12,000. So I pay the 12,000. They proceed to then send us
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.380]   pictures of Chuck Norris on private jets. You know, for
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.540]   years to this day, Chuck Norris living this life and I paid 12
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.380]   grand to save this.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.340]   Freebird told me the story. I found it so hilarious. But I
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.500]   told him, you know, after we got Joker when Jason when you came
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.820]   to visit us in Porto de Madre, Joker had like Jardia. So he was
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.460]   just everywhere. And you know, we got through it. And then three
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.500]   months ago, when you guys were at my house for poker, Sean made
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.060]   octopus and left some raw octopus in a garbage bag
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.660]   outside and Joker Joker ate it. And he got such terrible
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.060]   poisoning. We had to take him to the to the emergency animal
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.340]   hospital where he stayed for like a week. That was by the
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.100]   way, 17k. But ever since he came back, he's been completely
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.780]   incontinent. So I was done. Reaper that Nat and I now just
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.340]   wake up half an hour early. And what we do now from 630 to
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.180]   usually 645 is we're cleaning up some form of feces that he's
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.100]   left somewhere to go and find where did he take it? Let's go
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.060]   clean it up. And the worst one was he once pooped through one
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.580]   of the grates with this really bad poo and I had to go and just
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.580]   fetch it all out. It was just right in the grits. Fantastic.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.420]   Right? Yeah. So there you have it, folks. Go adopt a pet.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:07.180]   There's your endorsement for the $17,000 in veterinary bills and
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.660]   cleaning up all day long and replacing carpets. Listen, we
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.580]   got a big docket today. I know it's a bit early in the year,
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.700]   but I am going to add a new category. We're proposing a new
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.140]   category. We'd love to hear your feedback on it for the 2024
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.060]   besties, most based CEO, lots of options to choose from right
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.660]   now, which we'll get into in a minute. But there seems to be a
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.220]   bit of a vibe shift happening in tech during peak Zerp and cancel
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:39.860]   culture. 2019 to 2021 era, seemed like CEOs were a little
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.220]   vigilant about what they would say, you know, the Tim Cooks,
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.060]   the Sundars, but something has clearly changed. tech CEOs have
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.940]   gotten radically candid and fired their comms group. Two
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.700]   great examples this week that we were talking about. Jensen
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.580]   Wong, the CEO of Nvidia had this awesome clip when speaking at
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.340]   Stanford's Graduate School of Business.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.580]   I think one of my great advantages is that I have very
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.740]   low expectations. And I mean that most of the Stanford
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.100]   graduates have very high expectations. People with very
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.100]   high expectations have very low resilience. And unfortunately,
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.580]   resilience matters in success. I don't know how to teach it to
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.220]   you, except for I hope suffering happens to you. To this day, I
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.140]   use the word the phrase pain and suffering inside our company
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.740]   with great glee, boy, this is going to cause a lot of pain and
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.220]   suffering. And I mean that in a happy way. Because you want to
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.140]   train you want to refine the character of your company. You
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.900]   want greatness out of them. And greatness is not intelligence is
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.940]   greatness comes from character and character is informed out of
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.380]   smart people is formed out of people who suffered.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.860]   And then next up Palantir CEO Alex Carr called out the coked
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.940]   up short sellers on CNBC.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.460]   I love burning the short sellers like almost nothing makes a
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.460]   human happier than taking the glides of cocaine and away from
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.540]   these short sellers who like are going short on a truly great
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.540]   American company, not just ours, but it just love pulling down
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.500]   great American companies so that they can pay for their coke. And
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.100]   the best thing that could happen to them is we will provide we
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.420]   will lead their coke dealers to their homes after they can't pay
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:11.980]   their bills.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.540]   Surely all short sellers.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.340]   Yeah, well, you know, go ahead and do your thing. We'll do our
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:18.660]   thing.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.780]   There you have it, folks. Of course.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.500]   We had
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.540]   Ilan's great.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:32.620]   Good for you. At some New York Times conference, always candid.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.220]   And even Zuckerberg, he's been getting a little base. He did a
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.620]   whole video about how the Apple Vision Pro was when compared to
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.500]   menace quest to he's getting a little frisky on the social
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.740]   media. Freeberg is the vibe shift real.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.460]   It seems like a lot of people are less worried about cancel
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.820]   culture as they were three years ago. So I don't know if it's
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.260]   just in Silicon Valley, broadly in media. And broadly,
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.620]   culturally, there seems to be a move away from cancel culture
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.620]   mentality and people are speaking their mind. Which is
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.860]   yeah, I think obviously positive and refreshing.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.900]   Sachs, you're a big fan of freedom of speech. Your
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.020]   thoughts on this vibe shift? Is it is this related to cancel
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.980]   culture kind of ending and journalists just not being able
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.180]   to cancel people because they misspoke or were a little spicy
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.980]   in their takes?
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.780]   Well, I like the fact that the CEOs are all being colorful in
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.620]   their remarks and candid and interesting. And that that's
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.660]   always a good thing. In each of these cases, I kind of like what
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.060]   they had to say. But I think that you might, or we
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.780]   collectively might be reading a little bit too much into this. I
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.620]   mean, at the end of the day, what secret cows are they
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.940]   really challenging? What real dangerous truths are they
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.420]   speaking? What real risks are they taking? I just don't put
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.060]   any of the things that they're saying or doing in the same
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.020]   category, as say, what Elon has been doing in terms of taking on
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.380]   the powers that be, in terms of rolling back censorship, and
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.900]   promoting free speech on on x. I mean, Elon, I think has taken
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.700]   some real risks in doing that. And you see that he's paying the
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.380]   price with all these government investigations and the voiding
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.700]   of his compensation package. That I think is just in a
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.980]   slightly different category of true risk taking by speaking
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.540]   truth to power, or allowing the masses to speak truth to power,
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.940]   compared to what these other guys are doing. And I'm not
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.780]   disparaging any of them. But, you know, look at them one by
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.700]   one. I mean, Alex Karp made a colorful joke at the expense of
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.660]   short traders. I agree. But it's not really a risky remark.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.900]   Jensen Wang is giving some tough love to Stanford students. He's
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.860]   giving them I think, a good lesson of stopping so entitled,
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.220]   go get some real life experience. Be resilient. Okay,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.380]   great message. I saw the Zuckerberg clip liked it as
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.940]   well. He's basically speaking from a place of passion about
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.380]   his own product, and comparing it to Apple. Okay, great. That's
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.620]   what he's supposed to do. I don't see any of those CEOs take
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.860]   again, if you want to compare it to Elon, taking a really
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.060]   dangerous political stance. In fact, remember when Zuckerberg
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.700]   got dragged to Capitol Hill and gave that testimony, and they
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.220]   demanded that he give that apology. He did it. I mean,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.060]   you're genuflected. I thought that word was banned on this
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.380]   pod.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:39.740]   Anybody else can be genuflected. I mean, I thought he was just
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.820]   showing some humanity, which is, you know, kind of paradoxical.
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.020]   Look, I get it in that moment. But I'm just saying that, like,
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.380]   if you want to put it in the same category as Elon, the thing
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.100]   to do would have been to punch back. And I think in that moment,
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.420]   it was who it was Josh Hawley, the thing to do would have been
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.780]   to say no, it's it's you who are exploiting the misery and
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.660]   suffering of all of these people by trying to score political
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.660]   points. So anyway, I don't have a super base. Yeah, yeah, that
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.460]   would have been super base. So all I'm saying is that it's one
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:13.100]   thing for these founders and CEOs to be colorful and candid
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.820]   or whatever, that's all great. But have they really taken
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.180]   political courage?
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.500]   Your thoughts, Chamath on based CEOs?
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.380]   Well, I think Jason, the takeaway, I think you're almost
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.820]   on the right point, but not quite. I don't think this is
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.060]   based or not based. I think the point is, everybody is exhausted
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:39.140]   with the multiple layers of word scramble gymnastics that people
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.060]   have had to play. And they're like, enough's enough. I think
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.980]   the more interesting way to look at this is that there was a few
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.580]   year period where a lot of companies were under a lot of
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.460]   pressure. And folks felt that they couldn't say what was on
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.540]   their mind to really fix the problems that they saw. Now you
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.180]   have, you know, both of the companies and the CEOs you
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.220]   pointed out are firing on all cylinders, as far as anybody can
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.140]   tell from the outside. And there's a certain level of
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.980]   political capital that comes with that. And they're choosing
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.660]   to spend it. And I think that's the interesting takeaway, which
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.980]   is, as these companies become successful, again, as tech
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.700]   reemerges, again, from this multi year malaise, are folks
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.220]   going to find their voice or not? And I think that's the big
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.580]   point, which is that it seems at least that we can see this next
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.940]   generation of winning companies seems to have CEOs that will
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.420]   take a different path, they'll be maybe closer to Elon than
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.500]   closer to a politician.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.860]   Yeah, it's, I loved longs comments just about his secret
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.220]   weapons. He has incredibly low expectations. If you had said if
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.580]   you had said that comment a few years ago, the whole pain and
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.380]   suffering thing, what somebody would have said, I felt
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.660]   triggered, it touched my childhood trauma. You know, I
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.180]   had x, y, and z happened to me. And it's not that those people
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.300]   don't have valid claims, but they would have aired it in a
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.620]   way that tried to get him canceled effectively.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.820]   Yeah, he would be out of touch. He would be talking down to
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.700]   people to be a billionaire telling people like to suck it
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.660]   up. What is he doing?
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.140]   In fairness, I bet you there are people that felt that way
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.460]   even today when listening to his clip. The thing that is
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.740]   different, though, was the rest of us who also have had pain and
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.580]   suffering in our lives, retweeted it and was just like
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.820]   this is 100% awesome.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:36.580]   Yeah, I mean, finally, candid advice. Elon used to always say
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.860]   happiness equals this was his happiness formula happiness
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:48.420]   equals expectation reality minus expectations. And so if your
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.500]   expectations are really high, and reality doesn't hit it,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.620]   you're going to be sad. And if you keep your expectations low
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.660]   and realities, you know, okay, or good, yeah, you could be
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:01.500]   happy in life. But Freiburg, I just love of those quotes, maybe
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.260]   some thoughts about suffering and how hard it is. You're back
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.660]   in the CEO seat. How's that been going for you? Generally
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.220]   speaking, how hard is it compared to being a capital
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.620]   allocator? Curious. I was going to talk to you about that
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:20.460]   offline. Anyway, I probably have an unhealthy affinity for
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:29.620]   suffering. I think that if you come from certain backgrounds,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.780]   you're sort of trained that that's the place that your
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:39.740]   unconscious tends to want to be. And I think that that also some
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.020]   people call it chips on shoulders. Some people call it
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.540]   motivation. I mean, look at your friend, Elon, how much suffering
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.660]   he puts his himself through. I think it's a requisite to to
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.180]   greatness is you have to really find ways to sacrifice. Now, if
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.740]   I've said this a lot, there's a reason a lot of people that have
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.740]   had success in their career, don't end up being great
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.300]   entrepreneurs. Because as soon as you're faced with failure for
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.420]   the first time, it doesn't pattern match to what's happened
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.980]   to you. Historically, I go to a good school, I get good grades,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.020]   I go to Stanford, I get a degree, everything about every
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.540]   step you do, you're told if you do x, you will get y. And then
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.220]   you do x and you get y and you repeat. And at some point,
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.340]   you're considered successful in your education in your career,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.780]   and so on. If you then decide that entrepreneurship is the
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.180]   path for you, you realize that entrepreneurship is that there
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:39.580]   is no if x, then y, there is if x, maybe y, maybe z, maybe 100
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.820]   other things, it'll smack you in the face. And that experience is
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.820]   shockingly different for people that have historically followed
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.740]   a path of success of what's defined as success culturally,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.460]   socially. And I think that that's really what he's speaking
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.820]   to. If you've grown up where all of your expectations have not
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.980]   been met, or many of the expectations have not been met,
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.020]   you realize that persistence, grit, perseverance,
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.420]   relentlessness, these are the necessary traits to be
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.980]   successful in entrepreneurship. And I think that I find myself
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.020]   much happier in that condition than in any other condition. And
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.460]   it's why I'm actually very happy in the work I'm doing right now.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.020]   Yeah, I think that resonates a lot with me and all the
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.420]   entrepreneurs that I back. They all have that chip. And you got
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.780]   to be careful not to get caught up in the trappings and really
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.820]   focus on solving problems. If you think about what a CEO does
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.500]   all day, you hire the smartest team, you know, you give them
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.140]   the biggest challenges, as much autonomy as you can. And then
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.980]   they return back to you with all the problems, the smartest
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.820]   people you could find to join your team can't fix. So then
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:45.420]   your life becomes, essentially, you know, what's left over, that
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.380]   is the most brutal to solve. And, you know, there's only a
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.180]   certain percentage of people who can do that day in and day out,
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.420]   just relentlessly before you reconcile, how do you reconcile
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.620]   that statement, Jason, with the proposition that people should
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.860]   become entrepreneurs, generally, I think that this really, this
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.420]   really challenges me whenever people say I'm thinking about
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.180]   starting a company, my first response is no, don't, like, you
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.220]   have to be told over and over again, to not start a company to
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.780]   test it, they actually have the resilience and grit necessary
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.380]   just to take the first step of starting the company. I have
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.980]   gotten that everyone should be encouraged to start a company
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.100]   and entrepreneurism is a is a career choice, I think is a
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.740]   false notion. I think that most people are not psychologically
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.940]   equipped for being successful in entrepreneurship.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.580]   Yeah, you're 100%. Right. And I've gotten in my later years,
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.060]   as we run, like found university, these programs, when
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.060]   people are applying, and we only accept 10% into the programs,
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.420]   and then only invest in 10% of those are net net, like less
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.140]   than 1% get funded. You know, I'll ask them, they're like, Oh,
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.420]   can you give us money, so I can get a co founder. And I'm like,
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.220]   you know what, you failed the first test of being an
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.060]   entrepreneur. You know, the first test of being an
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.380]   entrepreneur is can you convince two or three people to go on
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.420]   this crazy journey with you, because it's important, and
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.460]   without money. And, you know, people expect, oh, you're going
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.460]   to just give them the money, because they have an interesting
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.540]   idea. And then I asked him, what's your skill? What do you
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.900]   do at the startup? Do you sell the product, you build the
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.140]   product. And a lot of people do not have the wherewithal to add
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.100]   a skill that the world needs, being a developer, a UX
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.380]   designer, a salesperson, whatever it is, right, they
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.540]   don't have any skill. And then they also have no ability to
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.380]   convince somebody else with skills to start a company. If
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.660]   you if you can't have marketable, important skills
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.020]   yourself, that you taught yourself on your own, through
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.340]   sheer force of motivation and will and opening up YouTube,
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.300]   which really is not hard people, like anybody can learn to code
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.340]   to be a UX designer to be a salesperson, all this is on some
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.620]   online course, some book, some YouTube video, some podcast, or
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.860]   just learn some marketable skills that a startup needs. And
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.980]   if you can't do that, you shouldn't be a founder.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.620]   I think the point is that everybody's capable of being a
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.500]   founder. And anybody can and should start a company, it's
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.300]   just that very few can finish a company. And that is the
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.180]   resilience part where there's just so many ups and downs. And
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.700]   you have to be able to roll and survive. And you have to just
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.780]   problem solve constantly. And yeah, there are very few people
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.540]   that are cut out for it.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.380]   You have to be comfortable with failure, you have to be
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.180]   comfortable with expectations not being met. That's the
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.820]   important point that he's making. I can't tell you how
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.780]   important it was early in my career, I had several cold
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.100]   calling jobs where I called called college kids, I called
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.540]   called alumni, I called called CEOs, I had three different cold
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.940]   calling jobs, and getting rejection after rejection,
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.700]   failing in my life, I didn't get into any schools except for
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.020]   Berkeley, because Berkeley didn't take teacher
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.700]   recommendations to be teachers, I did not do well in school. And
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.900]   then playing poker taught me a lot. Because playing poker, you
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.780]   lose hands, you lose hands, you lose hands, you lose hands, you
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.380]   have to just make sure that you're making the right
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.220]   decisions. And over time, the money will come to you, the
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.380]   positive EV will be there. But failure and persisting through
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.700]   failure, I think was one of the most important traits I had to
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.820]   develop before I was even ready to start a company. Because all
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.700]   that's happening every day is failure.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.500]   But I have my first magazine, I didn't understand I had just
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.260]   printed photocopies up and I had like 2000 copies of this
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.220]   magazine, Silicon Valley reporter. And I didn't know how
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.540]   to get them in people's hands. So I just got a luggage cart.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.220]   Like a literal luggage cart, I put them in the luggage cart and
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.380]   I walked around lower Manhattan. And I just dropped them off at
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.020]   internet companies. And I dropped them off at cafes. And
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.420]   then I went to all the village voice boxes, and I just slotted
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.620]   them in, in between the village voice. And miraculously, people
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.300]   found it, and then they would subscribe. And you know,
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.580]   whatever it took was the approach. All right, everybody,
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.380]   let's get to our second topic, a mini topic. But did opening I
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.740]   just get caught with their hand in the cookie jar or the
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:59.100]   training data cookie jar. Open AI CTO was interviewed by the
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.300]   Wall Street Journal this week. During the interview, you
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.140]   probably saw this if you're on x it trended, she was asked what
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.940]   data did opening I use to train Sora, if you don't know what
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.860]   story is, we talked about it here. It's that incredible. You
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.740]   know, video create, you know, type in a text prompt, get a
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.460]   video back model. And let's watch this clip and then
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.140]   discuss it.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.860]   What data was used to train Sora? We used publicly available
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:32.980]   data and license data. So videos on YouTube. I'm actually not
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:39.980]   sure about that. Okay. videos from Facebook, Instagram. You
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.620]   know, if they were publicly available, available yet
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:51.260]   publicly available to use. There might be the data, but I'm not
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.700]   sure. I'm not confident about it.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.020]   Let me start with you, Jamal. What are your thoughts here? And
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.460]   just her not being super prepared there to answer a
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.340]   question? Or is this a cookie jar situation? What do you
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.740]   think? I mean, you got to think the CTO of an organization that
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.980]   whose job it is to build models based on training data knows
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.260]   where the training data is from.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.100]   My interpretation of that answer is that she is hesitating
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.220]   because she doesn't want to make a statement against interest.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.420]   Right? I want to show you guys something. I had a friend of
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:29.340]   mine, somebody we all know, who's deep in the heart of this
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.060]   AI stuff. He was, he came to my office, and he showed me this
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.220]   one really interesting thing, which is when you launch chat
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.100]   GPT. And if you go into the microphone, but you say nothing,
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.380]   so just wait a few seconds, turn on the microphone, wait a few
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.620]   seconds and turn it off. I'll just do it right now just to
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.380]   show you. It comes back and it says thank you for watching,
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.340]   which is typically what it shows you when you auto watch a bunch
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:59.700]   of YouTube videos. Now, why is that interesting? Well, if you
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.780]   say nothing, right, the model has clearly then is guessing
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.500]   that whenever you see you hear silence, that probabilistically
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.380]   the next best thing to translate that into is thank you for
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.220]   watching, which would mean that the training happened on a bunch
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.220]   of content where thank you for watching was the next obvious
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.020]   thing so that when there's silence, and the most obvious
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.780]   place where that happens is in YouTube. I don't know, I thought
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.860]   that was an interesting little thing that he pointed out to me.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.540]   I don't know if anybody's actually explored this. But if
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.620]   it is true, and Google decides they have an issue with it,
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.980]   that's not good for these folks.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.300]   For your thoughts. I think it's fine. I don't know why this is a
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.220]   controversial thing.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.180]   Well, I mean, it's obvious she's kind of lying on camera.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.620]   She definitely knows where the training data came from. And it
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.860]   feels like see, see why.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.980]   I mean, what YouTube is public. So what's wrong with watching
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.300]   YouTube to teach a model stuff?
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.020]   Well, you'd have to get a license to make a derivative
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.820]   work. As we've seen, OpenAI has been doing that. They're in a
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.740]   lawsuit right now with the New York Times. And they failed to
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.060]   negotiate their license.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.580]   So the assumption is they're making a derivative work.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.460]   Yeah, I mean, they've licensed other people's data, right?
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.300]   Yeah, to get access to it that's not publicly available. You can
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.860]   go to YouTube downloader and download all this data. You know
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.020]   what's crazy? I heard from someone at Google that under the
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.660]   terms of service, Google's not allowed to train on YouTube
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.260]   data. Remember my I made this point a couple weeks ago about
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.580]   how important YouTube data is. I think there'd be this really
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.060]   ironic handicap that Google's done to itself, where anyone
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.100]   else can access and download and watch YouTube data to train
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.180]   models, but Google cannot. I don't know if there's any
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.580]   clarity on that. But it's a pretty crazy fact pattern. But
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.100]   yeah, YouTube's on the internet. And I feel like anything that's
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.300]   on the open internet should be watchable by these models. I
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.340]   don't consider training models to be generation of derivative
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.740]   work. That's my position.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.740]   And that's a position that OpenAI is taking the other side
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.700]   of that position because they're going around licensing data.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.340]   Saks, any other thoughts here about this kerfuffle?
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.660]   Well, look, I kind of agree with both you and Freeberg. In terms
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.700]   of the part that I agree with Freeberg, I think that this
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.500]   issue is kind of more of the same of what we've been talking
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.260]   about for a while, which is clearly OpenAI trained its model
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.180]   on publicly available data that was available on the on the
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.380]   internet. I agree with Freeberg that fair use doctrine should be
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.740]   applied to that. I know that you have a different point of view
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.460]   on that, Jake. I don't know if we need to rehash that. I
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.380]   understand that you don't think fair use should apply. In any
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:33.060]   event, I think it's pretty clear that OpenAI trained SORA using
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.260]   you know, available data on the internet, and that probably
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.420]   included YouTube. The part where I agree with you, Jekyll, is
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.900]   that, I don't know if I would say that she's lying per se, but
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:50.540]   I think she's probably concerned that if she comes right out and
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.620]   answers the question as directly as she could, that it could be a
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.500]   problem for them and all these lawsuits that they're now
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.860]   facing. You know, again, I think that I would take the side in
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.860]   those lawsuits that fair use should be allowed. But I think
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.660]   that probably she is being careful here, because they are
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.740]   facing so many lawsuits about this training data.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.140]   It's gonna be pretty clear, Chamath, I think what the courts
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.340]   will decide here, which is whose opportunity is it to make a
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.340]   SORA in the world? If Disney owns a massive collection of IP,
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.700]   and somebody should be able to use that IP to make derivative
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.220]   works? Should it be SORA? Or should it be Disney itself? And
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:32.260]   so I think the journalists know full well, what they're doing.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.060]   And now the journalists have their hooks into this for a very
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.900]   real reason. The journalists are also content creators. So now
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.460]   we're gonna have this, you know, two sides forming journalists
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.260]   worry that folks are not technical enough to make this
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.140]   decision. And you know, when it goes into a court, how is a
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.220]   judge really going to understand the nuances of this to make a to
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.500]   make a call on this, or the jury? It's going to be a big
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.980]   education process. Yeah, yeah, or the jury. Yeah. Speaking of
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:03.060]   AI, vertically, I startups are starting to make some noise. We
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.940]   all know about large language models. We've talked about them
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.980]   here. If you listen to this program, you know about OpenAI,
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.260]   Google's, Gemini, previously known as Bard, Anthropic, Claude,
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.420]   all this stuff, their general purpose, they've been trained on
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.380]   the open internet, as we were just discussing, so they can
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.940]   answer questions about almost anything. And yeah, sometimes
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.700]   it's correct. Sometimes they're incorrect, but it's showing
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.420]   promise. There is another school of thought here that's emerging
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.300]   in startups, vertical AI. These companies are kind of taking a
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:37.660]   job title, a role in society, and they are building vertical
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.820]   apps. Harvey is AI for lawyers, a bridge is doing an AI
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.820]   notetaker for doctors, saves them hours a day, according to
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.380]   them. Tax GPT is an AI tax assistant, and Sierra's AI for
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.380]   customer support. That's Brett Taylor's new startup. This week,
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.020]   a startup called cognition debuted a tool called Devon,
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.460]   they're calling it an AI software engineer, the demos
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.340]   went viral on x, you've probably seen them all over the place. And
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.300]   in the news, if you watch it, you can see Devon fixing bugs in
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.380]   real time fine tuning an AI model building apps and and, and
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.660]   people are speculating Devon was built on GPT for from OpenAI.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.980]   That's not confirmed. But according to the CEO, Devon was
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.500]   built by tweaking reasoning and long term planning into an
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.220]   existing LLM. Here's how it ranks against other major models
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.820]   on coding benchmarks. They're building all these benchmarks to
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.980]   test each language model. And as you can see, it's according to
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.780]   this chart, and according to their data, doing much better
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.100]   than just a generic language model kind of makes sense.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.940]   Schmaltz, did you see these demos this week? I think I saw
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.140]   you on the group chat talking about it. And what was your take
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.660]   on these role based vertical startups?
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.980]   Oh, I think this is so powerful. I mean, it's incredible, because
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.060]   we're measuring this progress in like, what, week over week?
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.860]   Feels like that. Yeah.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.620]   I think the point that you should take away is that the
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:11.860]   most of these very difficult in impenetrable job types, for the
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.260]   average person, if there's if you said to them, hey, become a
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.300]   developer, that's like a complicated journey, right? It's
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.820]   just going to be now like a command line interface where you
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.140]   just kind of describe in English what you want to do. And all of
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.380]   this stuff will just happen behind the scenes, and it'll be
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.980]   totally automated. So that'll grow the number of people that
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.420]   can use these tools. At the same time, it'll make the developers,
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.460]   I think even more valued, because you're going to need
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.220]   people in the guts of these models, and in the code that it
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.500]   generates, because it's not always going to work perfectly,
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.780]   there's always going to be some kind of hallucination, some
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.820]   stuff is not going to compile. Now, the demos that they did,
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.940]   though, were incredible, they were able to find errors, they
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.260]   were able to remediate errors in code. I mean, I just, I think
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.700]   it's really, really special.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.940]   So you you've been on copilots for the past year talking about
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.740]   that. This is slightly different. We're moving from,
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.460]   hey, here's a copilot, somebody helping a developer to, hey,
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.580]   here's a developer working, and now they have a supervisor. So
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.700]   what do you think of these sort of role based agents? And how
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.460]   quickly we went from year one copiloting to, okay, now they're
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.180]   the pilot, and we're sitting in the copilot seat watching them
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:27.900]   fly the plane?
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.740]   Yeah, well, look, first of all, everyone's working on autonomous
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.940]   coding, or working towards that this is like one of the core,
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.580]   most obvious use cases of LLM because code is text. And it can
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.420]   also be run through a compiler to debug it. So you can also get
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.100]   to, in theory, you can get to high levels of accuracy yet,
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.660]   although, in the example that you gave, Jason, this new
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.900]   product was only at 13%. So there's still a long way to go.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:59.100]   But the potential is clearly there. So a lot of companies are
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:04.380]   working on some variation of this idea. Devin is, I guess you
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.900]   call it an agent first approach. And I think that's very cool for
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.740]   generating new software projects. But where I think this
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.220]   gets much trickier, and is much more difficult, is when you're
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.780]   working in existing code bases. And just to talk my own book for
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.740]   a second, we're an investor in a company called source graph,
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.700]   they have a product called Cody, and their whole approach is
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.020]   context first, as opposed to agent first, it's all about
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.100]   getting the copilot to work inside of existing code bases.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.460]   So different companies are coming at this from different
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.700]   approaches, GitHub copilot, I think is kind of more like Cody,
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.460]   where it's all about making an existing code base more useful.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.340]   Whereas Devin, again, is starting with, I think, net new
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.580]   code bases, but that's going to demo really well. And so that's
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.700]   what you're seeing is like these really cool demos. In any event,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.140]   the larger picture here is that we are going to get better and
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:01.620]   better at coding autonomously, I guess you could say. And I don't
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.540]   know if it gets ever gets to 100%, where you don't need
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.540]   coders anymore. But it's going to make coders much more
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.460]   productive over time, you're gonna get this huge multiplier
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.220]   effect on the ability to write code. And that's really
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.740]   exciting for a bunch of obvious reasons.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.940]   For a while, we've been tracking this evolution from, you know,
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.420]   Gmail, guess the next word, guess the next phrase, guess the
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.740]   next sentence to copilots. Now we have these role based agent
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:35.260]   based solutions that startups are pursuing. What's next? If we
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.540]   follow this thread, what would the next evolution here? Well,
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.300]   the big push has been for this notion of AGI to replace a
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:49.820]   human. And I think what we're seeing is software that
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:56.060]   replaces a specific human doing a specific thing, like being a
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:00.060]   lawyer, being an accountant, being an art director, if you
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.300]   think about the internet, when the internet, which was like
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.220]   networking software, and the capabilities that arose from the
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.460]   connection of all these computers, during the internet
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.140]   era, the innovation was everyone tried to create a business model
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.900]   which was how do you take an existing vertical business and
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.340]   put it on the internet? I think what we're seeing in this era is
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.580]   everyone's taking a vertical human and creating a vertical
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:27.700]   version of a human in the AI era. And so I think like the the
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:33.820]   success will probably accrue to one company that replaces one
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.700]   set of core human services, like being a lawyer, being an
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:42.100]   accountant, you know, being an artist in whatever way. And that
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.900]   that ends up being the specific vertical tool that people will
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.420]   use to automate and scale up their ability to do that task in
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.020]   an automated way. Because I think that there's like a great
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.380]   deal of capability that emerges in the fine tuning and the
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.820]   unique data that certain people may have to make that one tool
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.340]   better than the rest. And therefore, everyone will end up
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.020]   using this one lawyer service, or this one accounting service or
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.260]   what have you. So I definitely think that's kind of what we're
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.460]   seeing. Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious where this is
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.700]   going. You got co pilots assisting a developer, or a
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.780]   lawyer, then the next were writer, then they got the next
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.860]   phase, okay, you've got a peer, so you're doing peer programming
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.100]   or somebody's kind of working alongside you, you're checking
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.380]   their work, and maybe they're even checking your work, seeing
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.300]   if you have bugs, where this is going to be next year is there's
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.660]   going to be a conductor, there's going to be somebody who has a
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.980]   role or a piece of software has a role, where you say, Hey,
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.660]   you're a CEO of a company, you're a founder, a product
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.700]   manager, here's your lawyer, here's your accountant, here's
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.780]   your developers, here's your designer. And now you will
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.620]   coordinate those five people. Now imagine how that changes
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.260]   startups when you as an individual have a conductor
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.780]   working with you and says, You know what, I don't know if I
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.260]   agree with this legal advice that's coming in in relation to
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.660]   the tax advice. And maybe we should not even add this feature
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.420]   to the program. Let's talk to the product manager, the agent
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.700]   product manager about taking that feature out. So we don't
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.820]   have these downstream legal issues. And we don't even have
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.300]   to file taxes in this area, it's gonna get really interesting
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.860]   next year when they have a conductor.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:20.140]   The other way it may go Jason is you have a lawyer that has 50
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.260]   associates working for them through the AI. So you don't
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.260]   replace the lawyer, you don't replace the software engineer,
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.100]   the software engineer levels up. And now the software engineer
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.540]   has 50 engineers available 50 agents running, doing tasks for
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.900]   them. You do still you do still need humans with domain
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.100]   expertise, and creativity to think through architecture to
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.820]   think through process and to make sure that the AI agents are
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.700]   doing their job. So I think what it creates is extraordinary
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.260]   leverage for people and organizations, which is why
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.260]   generally economic productivity goes up, people don't lose jobs,
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:51.940]   they level up.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.500]   In this phase, the the op ex of companies will probably be cut
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:02.300]   in half. At the limit, I think Jason is actually absolutely
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.220]   right. I think you find that there'll be millions of
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.300]   companies with one person, and then a whole layer of software
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.060]   and conductors and agents and bots. That's the future. So you
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.020]   won't have these engineering people, that person should be
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.100]   running their own company. And so you'll just have millions and
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.540]   millions and millions and maybe billions of companies. And I
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.660]   think that that's really exciting. Not all of them will
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.340]   work, many of them will fail, and a few of them will be
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:31.100]   ginormous. And it'll be up to the person who can navigate and
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.820]   be a conductor, as you said, you know, yeah, really interesting.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.620]   The solo entrepreneur movement of last couple years, there were
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.460]   all these kind of like independent hackers, building
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.220]   one item like Phil Kaplan did with distro kid, he said, like
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.660]   two or three people working on that got very big. You know, I
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.460]   was telling you guys about that slopes app I showed you, I
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.980]   reached out to the founder of that. I was like, Hey, tell me
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.220]   about the business, like, it's enough of a business to support
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.100]   one person or two people, like, there will be a lot of these
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.500]   apps or services, one conductor. And yeah, it makes what half
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.580]   million a year, 3 million a year, whatever, it's enough to
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.620]   support 123 people working on it. But previously, you know,
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.180]   you'd be going to the venture community like, Oh, what did it
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:15.060]   take a modern app company, sacks to kind of build an Android and
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.980]   a, an iOS app, just, you know, 510 years ago, if we were
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.260]   funding 110 years ago, what would the footprint look like?
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.740]   For, you know, a consumer app company,
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.140]   if you're going to go all the way back to like the late 90s
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.580]   during the.com era, I remember that with PayPal, just to
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:38.380]   launch, really, what was an MVP, we had, I'd say a dozen
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.940]   developers, and it was pretty expensive. And we had to set up
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.020]   our own colo. There's all this infrastructure that all got
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:48.380]   abstracted away with AWS, then you move to the mobile era. And
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:52.740]   the app stores provide. There's just a lot more developer tools
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.220]   for more API's. Yeah, it was well as distribution, but it's
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.100]   far easier to code these apps. So definitely things have
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.620]   gotten easier and easier. That's the trend. If that's the
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.980]   point you're trying to make. It's certainly never been easier
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.220]   to get started in creating something if you're a solo
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.980]   developer. Yeah. That being said, I think that depending on
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.860]   what you're trying to do, it's still usually the case that if
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.260]   you're trying to do something interesting and profound, you're
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.060]   going to need a small team of developers and a couple million
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.220]   bucks to get you started.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.580]   Yeah, it used to be rule of thumb, I think 12 people for an
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.740]   app company, you get two or three working on each platform,
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:35.460]   a couple designers could be testing and design UX, you get
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.900]   to 1012 people to run a modern one. Alright, everybody, next
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.340]   issue, the house just passed a bill that would either ban tick
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.220]   tock or force a sale. We talked about this bill being proposed
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.140]   last week, and things had moved really slowly on the tick tock
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.540]   band. Now they're moving really fast. On Wednesday, the house
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.420]   passed the bill with a bipartisan vote of 352 to 65.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.940]   Making this one of the few subjects that members of
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.980]   Congress can agree on. Biden has also signaled his intent to sign
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.620]   the bill into law should it pass the Senate passing the Senate
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.140]   that could be an obstacle Democratic majority leader Chuck
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.340]   Schumer has signaled a lack of interest in the subject and
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.940]   said he'll review the bill with committee chairs before deciding
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.820]   on the path forward arguments for and against the bill have
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.660]   centered around a few main points reciprocity. We talked
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.500]   about that here. You can't use Instagram x or any of our
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.100]   domestic social networks in China. And if they won't allow
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.700]   us in their country, why should we give them unrestricted access
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.580]   to our stifling debate, progressives fear this isn't
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:41.380]   really about national security. Their position is mainstream
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.860]   politicians are hoping to shut down political discourse,
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.740]   particularly among the youth who are mostly on tick tock,
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.500]   particularly pro Palestinian and anti Israel discourse,
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.140]   which seems to flourish on tick tock versus other platforms.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:58.940]   Coincidentally, Joe Biden launched a tick tock account
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.580]   last month, and his comments were instantly flooded with pro
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:08.460]   Palestinian remarks, some calling him genocide, Joe. Third
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.060]   argument overreach some sex, I think you've pointed out that
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.940]   the language in this law is a bit vague, it needs to be
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.220]   tightened up. Maybe the President could go after
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.540]   companies supposedly aligned with foreign interests who
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.220]   aren't our esteemed patriot and friend Keith were boy argued
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:29.140]   with you sacks on this on x. And then there are guys like Trump
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.580]   and Vivek, who I believe are flip flopping based on securing
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:37.100]   bags, Vivek called tick tock digital fentanyl. And Trump
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.460]   issued an executive order calling for ByteDance to divest
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.980]   tick tock in 2020. Now, they're both opposing the ban. And
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.340]   interestingly, both Trump and Vivek have ties to the
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:53.020]   Republican mega donor Jeffrey. Yes, who is a major shareholder
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:57.820]   in ByteDance with a reported 15 to $30 billion stake he gave
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:02.540]   Vivek 5 million bucks, who knows what Trump's gotten. But they
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.500]   said they're back in love. Sachs, you had this big back and
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.740]   forth with Keith for a boy on x. Are you in support of the
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.380]   divestiture or not? I haven't been able to track exactly where
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.100]   you're at of this.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.780]   Well, I think my take on this, and I'm gonna have to revise and
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.940]   extend my remarks from last week, because I didn't know as
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.740]   much about the bill, I hadn't actually read the language yet.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.740]   And now I have. And my take on this is that the bill poses
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.780]   significant risk of being Patriot Act 2.0. So in other
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.580]   words, you know, a threat to the security of the United
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.140]   States is basically hyped up, some part of it may be real,
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.420]   some of it may be threat inflation. And then we give the
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.220]   intelligence community and the government new powers, which can
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.780]   then be abused. And that's exactly what happened with the
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.780]   Patriot Act, they ended up spying on Americans. Now, what
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.340]   is the potential abuse here? This is the thing that I've
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:01.820]   debated with Keith. And there's also other people who I respect
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.180]   a lot. And Keith, by the way, is a very talented lawyer, in
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.820]   addition to other things being a successful founder and investor
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.900]   and investor. And then you know, I saw that cigar and Jenny whose
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.220]   show I was just on thinks that the bill is just fine. So look,
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.860]   there are people, very legit people who disagree with me
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.380]   about this. But I went last night, I read this bill, like
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.660]   four times to try and like parse the language. And I've just come
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:32.220]   away concluding there's no, the way I see it, there's no way to
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.060]   argue that this language isn't vague, and could invite abuse.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.740]   And you really have to dig into it. But let me just kind of walk
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:44.600]   you through, I think a key part of it. So first of all, this
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:49.460]   bill doesn't just ban or force the divestiture of Tick Tock, it
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.980]   goes after what it calls foreign adversary controlled
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.220]   applications. Now, what is a foreign adversary, there are
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.780]   four countries that are defined as foreign adversaries, it's
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.500]   basically, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, I'm not super
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.620]   worried about that list of foreign adversaries growing,
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.940]   because that does take a bunch of procedural hoops to go
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.600]   through it. What I am concerned about is when the bill talks
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.260]   about what makes a company controlled by a foreign
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.780]   adversary. And if you go to that language, which is then
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.820]   definition, so you know, what frequently happens with these
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.300]   bills is that a lot of the meat is actually in the definitions,
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.540]   you have to look at this very carefully. It says here, the
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.820]   term controlled by foreign adversary means with respect to
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.340]   a covered company, that such company or entity is and then
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.420]   there's three categories. The first category is a foreign
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.100]   person, which can also mean a foreign corporation that's
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.980]   domiciled in or is headquartered or has its principal place of
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.900]   business, or is organized under the law of foreign adversary
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.380]   country. So that would be like ByteDance. Okay, ByteDance is a
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.740]   Chinese company, okay, then it says, or it can be an entity,
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.940]   where 20% of the ownership group is in that foreign person
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.060]   category. So that would be like you, let's say you had a US
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:10.940]   company, but 20% of the company was owned by, I don't know if
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:16.100]   Chinese VCs or by ByteDance, okay, that would also be a
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.040]   controlled by a foreign adversary, then you get to the
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.540]   provision that I think is the most problematic, which is, it's
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:27.380]   a person subject to the direction or control of a foreign
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.900]   person or entity. The novel language here is where it says
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:35.700]   subject to the direction of, okay, it's not just saying under
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.460]   the control of it's saying subject to the direction of, in
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:45.260]   my view, that's very vague. And it creative prosecutor, creative
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.460]   Attorney General could try to say, well, wait a second, if
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:55.700]   Elon has a major Tesla factory, in Shanghai, is he subject to
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.460]   the direction of the Chinese Communist Party, because they
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.180]   could influence him, they could leverage him. If Donald Trump is
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.300]   accused on virtually a daily basis of being a Russian asset,
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:11.820]   is he subject to the direction of Vladimir Putin, David from
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.100]   just tweeted very recently that he said that not only Trump, but
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:19.060]   the entire Republican Party that works for Trump is under the
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.660]   direction.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.140]   Yeah, that's a partisan hack, though, that's not like actual
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.220]   factual in a court, right. So this would have to be proven
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.380]   factual in the court. Okay, do you think or no?
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.260]   Well, the ag could open an investigation, based on the
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.820]   theory that, for example, Trump owns true social, and Trump is
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.860]   under the direction of a foreign adversary, ie Putin, because the
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.980]   mainstream media continues to normalize this idea and spread
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.340]   this idea on virtually a daily basis. So the point is that
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.860]   look, first, the ag would open an investigation, you think
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:48:00.500]   about the sledgehammer type of remedy here that an Elon or a
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.700]   Trump or a you take rumble, for example, which is also accused
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.620]   of being a Russian agent, they could be forced to divest the
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.900]   company or to have it be banned. So it gives huge, I think new
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:19.660]   powers to the executive branch to pursue political opponents
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.860]   and political enemies, whether they actually win in a court of
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:27.140]   law down the road is kind of secondary because they can vex
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.100]   and harass their political enemies using this power. So my
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.660]   point is that at a minimum, I think this language needs to get
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:38.780]   cleaned up. I think it is way too vague. And you still have
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.340]   the issue of whether it's a good idea or not, to force the
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:45.540]   banning or divestiture of tick tock. But this bill goes way
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:50.020]   beyond it. Again, it creates this novel category of foreign
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.580]   adversary controlled applications, which also, like I
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.460]   said, includes websites. And that means not just foreign
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.980]   companies, but domestic companies as well that are set
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.980]   to be under the direction of a foreign actor. So again, I, I
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.140]   don't know how anyone can look at this language and not say
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.020]   it's too vague.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.900]   Yeah, it's easy enough. Tighten it up. And if it was tightened
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.500]   up, you'd be in favor of the tick tock, man, I take it sex or
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.060]   divestiture. I should say, I keep saying ban, you would still
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.900]   want the Chinese government to not have control of this or, or
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.860]   by dance. Yeah.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.260]   I still have very mixed feelings about the idea of just the tick
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:28.060]   tock ban. Because look, you're talking about an app that 100
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.940]   million Americans use for something like 90 minutes a day.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.820]   So people obviously get a lot of value out of this. I've yet to
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:41.300]   see the the hard proof that this app is under the control of the
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.380]   CCP. I mean, I know that allegation is made. I can
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:49.180]   understand why journalists are ready. Yeah. But it's it's very
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:53.440]   unclear to me that they have the goods on that. And I do think
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.260]   that depriving Americans of the right to use this app that they
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:02.860]   clearly enjoy and love, based on a threat that has yet to be
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.580]   proven. That makes me I'm deeply ambivalent about that.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:11.020]   Martha, if we were to look at, say, media channels, newspapers,
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.580]   there's been rules about foreign ownership of those do you
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.060]   believe tick tock kind of falls into that as Zack said,
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.740]   Americans are enjoying this in a massive way 100 million plus 90
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.540]   minutes a day, the statistics are crazy. That actually, I
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:29.060]   think argues for, you know, not having a foreign adversary own
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.940]   this or have access to it, we wouldn't allow them to own CNN,
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.060]   Fox, New York Times, Washington Post, etc. We have rules against
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.260]   that already. So are you in favor of this tick tock
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:47.380]   divestiture? Yes or no? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Freeberg.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:51.020]   I like to hear I like to hear him expand on
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.900]   I'll tell you before I tell you why. I'll tell you a quick
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:00.760]   story. Two or three months ago, after Joker was sick, we started
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.700]   to make his own dog food, right. So to have like a super bland
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.100]   diet, we had the service that was sending us food and we got
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.580]   rid of it and we would just make it ourselves. And part of the
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:17.540]   meal was like some raw apples and carrots that I would that I
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.060]   would cut up. And I would always complain to my I hate peeling
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:25.300]   these apples or whatever, slicing them and taking the core
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.540]   out. Just just said that. For the next month and a half, all I
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:35.580]   got was apple coring utensils on tik tok. And she was like, Oh,
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:38.900]   you know, we should get rid of XYZ food service. And she would
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.860]   just get plastered with these ads. And it was just a reminder
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.500]   to me that these apps are constantly listening. Now that's
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.540]   a benign example. But my phone is on my desk when I'm talking
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:54.300]   about some really important stuff. Again, important related
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.180]   to me both personal and professional, where there's lots
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.220]   of money on the line. There's moments where for certain parts
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.860]   of my business, like with crypto, we have like 19 layers
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.340]   of people that have to you have passwords upon passwords upon
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:13.900]   passwords to do stuff. The phone is always there. It was just a
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:17.740]   reminder to me. So I deleted tik tok, it's gone, which sucks
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.220]   because I would relax with that app at night. Like, you know, I
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.660]   would have 1520 minutes where I would press. It's super fun.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:29.340]   It's a great app. I have to be honest with you. I love it. But
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.860]   as a consumer, that was the decision I made as a business
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:41.940]   person. What I'll say is it is inconceivable to me that our
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.660]   voice signatures aren't being mapped. And there isn't a
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.660]   massive sort of file and repository that is
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:55.260]   understanding what we're all saying. And it's then further
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.860]   inconceivable to me that there isn't a service that's an
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:02.140]   identifying that this is probably David Sachs. And this
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.580]   is Chamath and this is free bird. And we're not really all
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.500]   that important. But let's take a better example. This is Elon
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.740]   Musk. This is the President of the United States. This is or
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.540]   the waiter that works for the president who has his phone in
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.900]   his pocket while he's sitting inside the you know, the the
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:23.820]   residences of the White House. So I think it's happening. I
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.100]   think they're not the only one though. I think there's
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.340]   American companies that are doing it too. And so I think
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:35.940]   that we need to start somewhere until we can have our apps in a
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:40.900]   market. They shouldn't have their apps here. And I think
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:41.700]   that should be the end of it.
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.140]   Completely reasonable. I think I'm gonna disagree. I think a
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:50.340]   couple points. I don't believe in the notion of like
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:55.100]   reciprocity for reciprocity sake. China blocks access to US
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.180]   content. Does that mean the US government should block access
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.100]   to international content? I think the answer is no, because
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.980]   this country is different than China. We have afforded
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.700]   ourselves freedoms and liberties that don't exist in
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.020]   other countries, freedom of choice, freedom of speech,
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.580]   freedom of the press, and so on. So I don't think that the
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.940]   government should be restricting access to content. Because
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.260]   another country restricts access to our content, I think that we
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.580]   should make decisions based on what's right for the citizens,
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.300]   what's right for the country, what's right for national
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.540]   security, what about spying apps? So that's, that's, that's
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.900]   my, my next point. So I do think that if there is a case to be
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.700]   made, that there is spying or data acquisition that's going on
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.260]   through these apps, we're not talking about rice noodles over
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.220]   here, you know, we're talking. And so I think if that's true,
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:45.900]   then I would imagine that there are multiple paths to alleviate
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.580]   that, like move all the servers to the US and separate the
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:52.100]   entity force a sale, you know, like, I think I don't think that
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:56.020]   it's necessarily appropriate to say that there aren't other
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.820]   courses or other options available to try and prohibit
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.300]   what should generally be prohibited, which is spying on
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:07.780]   American citizens, and capturing data that people, you know,
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:11.140]   haven't opted into being captured, I do believe that
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.900]   citizens and people should have the right to decide if they want
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.740]   to have their data used to be able to access an app, I
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.100]   actually am not a big believer that we should be paternalistic
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.620]   in the government sense and saying, having the government
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.460]   come in and say, here's an app, and we have determined that it
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.860]   is not good for you, because this data is being used in a
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.620]   manipulative way against you. I think that citizens should be
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.340]   afforded transparency and make a decision about whether or not
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.500]   they want to participate.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.220]   And I don't think I don't think citizens have the
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.980]   sophistication to understand what foreign adversaries, again,
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.140]   we only have four, so they were named there for a reason, are
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:48.340]   doing with our data. And I don't think that they should have to
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.660]   be forced to choose. I think that, you know, this is not
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.540]   dissimilar to how the FDA says, you're not qualified to decide
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.180]   whether this drug is good, we will tell you, and people are
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.140]   okay with that. Because you are saying this is part of the
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.180]   government infrastructure that's full of experts who know the
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.340]   totality of a subject. And so the problem is, in order for
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.740]   anybody to make a reasonable decision, you'd have to share so
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:12.140]   much as to just completely blow up a bunch of national security,
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:12.980]   which is not going to happen.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.260]   Well, look, I think we can have audit rights, and we can have
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:17.220]   rights that protect our citizens. I think that that's
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.940]   appropriate. I'll also say my final point on this, I think
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:26.300]   that whether it's intentional or not, this sort of action leads
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.340]   to inevitable cronyism and regulatory capture. Who does
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.060]   this benefit? If tick tock gets banned in the US, it's going to
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.380]   benefit meta, it's going to benefit Instagram, it's going to
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.020]   benefit a few other, you know, social networks going to benefit
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.020]   Elon at Twitter, there's a few folks that are going to benefit
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.860]   pretty significantly if tick tock is banned, because all
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.180]   those users are going to migrate. I will also say by the
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.740]   way that many 1000s of people make their living on tick tock,
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.300]   like it or not, it's a big income stream for a lot of
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.580]   people in the US, and a really important part of their
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.060]   livelihood.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.020]   And just to be clear here, this is not about banning tick tock.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.100]   This is about divestiture. Then if it's not divested, then it
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.220]   gets banned. So if you just think from first principles
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:09.340]   here, why wouldn't they divest? Why would you keep this? The
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.380]   reason is, this is a incredibly powerful tool. Under no
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.860]   circumstances, would the Chinese government ever allow us to have
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.140]   this kind of reach into their populace. And if you want to
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:23.740]   judge a person, you can just look at their behavior. Citizens
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.780]   in China live either in a complete police state where
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:31.060]   everything they do is tracked every transaction, facial
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.340]   recognition, every step they take, every purchase they make
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.740]   is tracked, or you're in a literal concentration camp.
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.700]   That's how the people of China live today. We are their
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.860]   adversary, they have noted that we're their adversary. Under
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.780]   what circumstances would you think they would treat us any
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.540]   differently than they treat their own citizens? It is
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:56.220]   absolutely insane that anybody would take the side of the CCP
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.860]   on this, you are asking them to divest, you're not asking them
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:04.260]   to shut it down. That is a partisan sort of angle on this.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.140]   And there's a lot of partisanship going on, on the
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:10.140]   edges on this. But what we have to realize is they would never
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.100]   allow us to do this to their citizens, and how they treat
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.740]   their citizens is obvious.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.980]   As an example, we've tried, you know, we tried to export sugar
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:21.300]   via McDonald's and Coke, and actually, they have domestic
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.460]   brands that they were able to support and prop up. So they
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.820]   have more control of that, too. So even, even even our downstream
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.100]   attempts to actually send products that theoretically over
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.140]   long periods of time aren't necessarily beneficial. They've
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.180]   they're smart enough to actually blunt
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.260]   Yeah, and they don't let their kids play video games or use
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:37.820]   Tick Tock.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.900]   Well, even video games, they saw video games are bad. It's not
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.020]   like they're like, Oh, Activision, come on in the doors
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.660]   are open. They're like, you can use it an hour. No, I think it's
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:48.540]   like three hours a week, and certain kids. And then the
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.140]   weekends and certain kids are totally bad. They have an
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.740]   ability to make strategic decisions that benefit their
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:58.300]   population. And I think that we have never attempted to I'm not
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.820]   saying that this law is going to be great. But you'd have to be
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:05.820]   extremely naive to assume that there is nothing bad going on
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:08.420]   here with this app. It doesn't mean that there's nothing bad
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:11.660]   going on with all the other apps. I am assuming that all
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.780]   these apps have foreign actors that have infiltrated them. I
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.380]   think that's the right posture to have. I don't have Instagram
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.060]   on my phone. I don't have Facebook on my phone. I don't
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:23.340]   have Tick Tock anymore on my phone, the only thing that's
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:30.060]   left is x. And at some point, if those apps can prove that there's
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.580]   a chain of custody, so for example, you know, one thing
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.860]   that I thought of you could do is you could put some kind of
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:38.980]   like ITAR regulations around this so that only US citizens
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:43.620]   could work on these apps, any app that is ambiently observing
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.620]   you. I think the overwhelming majority of people there's, it's
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:51.140]   very benign implications. But the whole point is that if you
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.380]   have 300 million people that are being observed, you're going to
[00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.660]   get also the 1000 or 10,000 that are super important. And you're
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.860]   going to catch stuff that you're not allowed to know. And that's
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:08.140]   not ready doing this, pull up the article, Nick, Tick Tock has
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.540]   already admitted to and been caught with their hand in the
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.940]   cookie jar spying on journalists. We know that
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:18.260]   they're doing this already. And we know their track record for
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.900]   spying on their own people. This is the no brainer of no brainer
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.580]   decisions, just divest. And if they won't divest, it tells you
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.980]   everything you need to know, this is super valuable to them.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.220]   And that algorithm is so valuable that they know they can
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.380]   program the US citizenry.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.500]   I think the other problem is, I'm not sure that the people
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.420]   with the technical sophistication will have the
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.660]   time to then actually go and audit the code base to really
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.860]   know that there aren't any Easter eggs in here. And there
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.100]   aren't real backdoors. And they won't. So this is my point. I
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.820]   think divestiture should not be allowed. I actually just think
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.420]   unfortunately, this app should just be shut down. And the
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.180]   people will migrate to Instagram, and the people migrate
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:01.660]   to YouTube, and new products, and or new products. And the
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.860]   thing there is that at least these are American controlled.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.300]   And are there data leaks happening in those apps?
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.900]   Probably. But it's at least not so brazenly obvious.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.260]   sacks your thoughts.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.700]   I'm a little confused here. Are you guys saying that the Chinese
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.100]   government uses to talk to spy on its own population? Or they
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.660]   ban it because they think it's harmful?
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.980]   No, they ban tick tock there because it's harmful. No, they
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.980]   complete control over tick tock. Yes. And they control that in
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.820]   their country. They use camera sacks. And you know this full
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:35.900]   well on every single corner with facial recognition, and every
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.140]   one of their phones is tracked. You know this full well sacks
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.940]   they are spying on their pockets or not. No, they have bad tick
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.100]   tock. They have a different version called a different
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.500]   version. And in that version, and by the way, and they push
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.780]   Matt doions algorithms are very different. They push educational
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.260]   content. There's so basically, like on the on the ByteDance
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.140]   board, what happened with this whole thing is the the CEO and
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.020]   the founder had to step down effectively, right, they brought
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.220]   in effectively new management. And in that the CCP hat is a
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.820]   board of board director and has what's called the golden vote.
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.060]   So they effectively decide. And so what you saw were the
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:19.020]   algorithms morph over time from pure entertainment, to things
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:23.540]   that pushed a lot of educational content. They also then imposed,
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.700]   broadly speaking, limits on content that they didn't like,
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.340]   they would only allow in other apps, experiences where they
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.940]   also have a board seat now and a golden vote. As Jason said,
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.380]   games can only be played in certain apps for certain amounts
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.500]   of time. So they've made their own decisions about what's good
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.060]   for their own population. The flavor of the app that's here,
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.820]   my my biggest point is that, again, you have to pick the
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:53.380]   lesser evil. I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that all
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:58.380]   these apps are infiltrated. But this one is more brazen, because
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.100]   it is really the only one that's completely and obviously foreign
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:07.420]   control. And I don't think that if you tried to divest it, you
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:10.460]   will get any assurance that that code is reliable. And so you'd
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.740]   have to build the whole thing from scratch all over again, for
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.860]   what it's worth, the company has said that they're willing to
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:21.380]   move all of their hosting in the US to Oracle data centers in the
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:21.900]   US,
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.780]   David, you and I know what that means. I could you imagine a
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.540]   migration like that, who is going to look at every single
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.300]   endpoint, every single line of code, that is a joke that's
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   meant to allay people who are not technical.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.740]   Right? Yeah. I kind of agree with that.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.540]   All right. It seems like we're I don't know if we're 2v2 here.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.700]   But look, I you may or not been sacks with the language is
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.580]   corrected. Are you banner divest or what?
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:48.900]   I'm ambivalent about it, because I'm open to the idea of banning
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:55.340]   a foreign app in this way. But the reason why I'm a little bit
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.780]   ambivalent about it is because a I think that what they're doing
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.020]   has to be proven, as opposed to just a bunch of hand waving over
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.500]   it. And when you start talking about what's happening to the
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.980]   Uyghurs, a concentration camps, and spying that has nothing to
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.780]   do with this particular app. And in fact, you've revealed this
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.540]   app doesn't even function in China. I think there's just a
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:18.180]   lot of hand waving going on a lot of hard proof. And I don't
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.300]   think that one little story in the New York Times, I would
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.180]   consider hard proof.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.220]   I agree with sex.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:26.580]   Yeah. So that's number one is I'm open to this idea. But I
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.700]   want to see hard proof. Number two is,
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.020]   I don't think you're gonna get it. I think the NSA and the CIA
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:35.980]   will read in the Intelligence Committee. And there's a sub
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.260]   committee that's probably been read in. But I can guarantee
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.140]   you, the American public will not get ridden on what
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:44.340]   Manchin said on CNBC today, by the way, that, you know, he has,
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.260]   based on his information, he believes strongly that they
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.580]   should divest, whether it's to his group or another group.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.700]   These guys have lied so many times about so many things. I
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.660]   mean, I just think the public has a right to know, look, if 100
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.860]   million Americans are going to be deprived of using an app they
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.180]   love, why can't we get a little bit more information? Well,
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:03.140]   they're not exactly what I think they're saying is done wrong.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.860]   They're saying it, they're saying it's in control. It's
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.900]   it's being controlled by a foreign adversary. They are
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:12.460]   saying it, the bill says it. What is debatable, they're
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.820]   telling you means all that means is that the app is owned by
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.940]   ByteDance, which is, here's what's unique about this,
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.300]   which is incorporated in China. Here's what here's what's
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.780]   unique about this bill. It got out of committee 50 to zero. It
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.220]   was overwhelmingly approved by both sides of the house. And it
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.860]   looks like in the Senate, there may be some refinements that
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.580]   happened, but it's going to get largely overwhelmingly approved
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.580]   there as well. It's like the Patriot Act. Hold on. It's a
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:42.340]   very unique moment in time, where you see in today's
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:48.300]   political landscape, such uniformity. And again, I'm not
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.340]   going to go and defend these folks. But except to say that
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.820]   where there's smoke, there's probably fire. And I think that
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:59.460]   in this specific narrow case, again, we're not talking about
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.780]   foodstuffs or lumber, right, we're talking about a
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:06.780]   technological application that is observing a lot of people on
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.580]   a continuous 24 by seven basis. I suspect this, this law would
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.900]   not have gotten out of committee 50 to zero, had they not been
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.740]   read in by the NSA and the CIA. And that will never see the
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.780]   light of day because we will never be disclosed that
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.540]   information. Okay, so it could have been 49 to one, David, you
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.740]   know what I mean? Another question.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:29.420]   I want to respond to that ideological, I could see it
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.820]   being 40 to 10. If it's ideological, I could be seeing
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.740]   it 35 to 1548 to two, it was 50 to zero.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.900]   So what's the Patriot Act? Look, there's an old saying in
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.860]   Washington that the worst ideas are bipartisan. These guys were
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.980]   all being stampeded into this act, they brought it up and
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.140]   passed it with hardly any debate. I've already shown you
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.620]   how the language of the bill is overly broad. It's not just a
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:58.500]   tick tock ban. It says that any app or website, did you know
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:02.580]   that any app or website domestically, that's subject
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.340]   subject to the direction of a foreigner, one of these
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.020]   countries,
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.820]   four countries, North Korea, Russia, China,
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:12.220]   I said a foreigner from one of those countries. Yeah, no, I'm
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.300]   trying to be clear for the audience. All you got to do is
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.540]   make that argument. If you're an eg who wants to go after one of
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.180]   our domestic platforms, that's all you got to do to bring them
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:25.500]   under your thumb, what would be the proper route? If a US
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.100]   platform was in fact compromised by the Chinese, North Koreans,
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.180]   or Iran? What would be the proper path in your mind?
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.060]   Wouldn't that concern you?
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:38.540]   If an app is sharing us data in a way that it shouldn't, then
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.060]   why wouldn't it be prosecuted?
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.780]   Yeah, which is what this is saying, right? The ages would
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.140]   go? It's not it's not it's not even it's banning tik tok. Okay,
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.940]   subject to maybe divestiture happens. But there's a lot of
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.140]   people who think that the six months they're giving for the
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.500]   business is not going to work. And the Chinese government may
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:57.540]   not go for the idea of allowing tik tok to be bought by an
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.780]   American company, because they may not like the precedent that
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.700]   creates. So again,
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.460]   I think you're answering your own question. I think you're
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.100]   making a very important and good point, which is, there's so much
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:11.300]   body of business law here. And there's so many state agees who
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.780]   would want to make their bones. And you see the state agees
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.300]   trying to build their credibility, going after
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.780]   Facebook for sexual exploitation, and all of this
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:23.740]   stuff. They're to your point, David, there is such a body of
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:27.540]   lawsuits and law and precedent, that tik tok could have been
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.220]   prosecuted under, it's very odd and rare that there's been a
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.420]   complete detente, where this thing came on from up above, and
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:39.140]   everybody just got on board. And all I'm saying is, in these very
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.660]   rare and unique instances where somebody shelled their own
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.380]   personal political aspirations.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:48.340]   No, I think that we don't know.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:52.140]   Alarm bells go off when DC acts with this kind of unanimity,
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:55.300]   because the only time they ever do that, when they become a unit
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.020]   party is when the national security state wants some new
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.540]   power. I agree with this is how we got into the
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:04.780]   almost unanimous. This is how we got into the Patriot Act. I'm
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.780]   not saying it's right. I'm not saying
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.660]   every dumb idea that gives the federal government more power
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.940]   ends up being almost unanimous.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:16.060]   You're absolutely right. And I'm agreeing with you. They were
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.340]   read in at a national security level that got them to become a
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:22.900]   unit party on this topic. We are never going to get and I'm just,
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:25.260]   you know, responding to Fribourg, we are never going to
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:25.940]   get read in
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.940]   we the people because of this, like, phony concern about you,
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.780]   they always like classification when they don't want the public
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:34.660]   to know something. Now, by the way, this should be secret. But
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.260]   by the way, give us the proof. Why can't they give us a proof?
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.140]   I don't think it needs to be proof. It's the potential damage
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.780]   here that they're saying is the problem sacks, they could wake
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:47.220]   up this algorithm at any point in time. And they could steer
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:51.060]   people's thinking they have already steered it. Your party
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:56.140]   has talked incessantly about how tick tock has steered cultural
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.580]   issues in a certain direction, thus libs of tick tock, all this
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.300]   kind of stuff. There is ample evidence that these social
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.140]   networks and these videos do influence young people. So if
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.380]   young people are addicted to this, which they clearly are,
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.060]   and if young people are influenced by this, which they
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:16.900]   clearly are, those are just facts that are indisputable. The
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.180]   Chinese could wake this up at any time, and steer political
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:24.140]   issues left, right center cause chaos. It is the potential harm
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.060]   here sacks. That is the concern. It's not just that they're doing
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.660]   it now. It's that they could do it in the future. And if you
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:34.540]   were to take this and you were to put, let's say this was North
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:39.300]   Korea or Iran, would your would you allow North Korea, or Iran
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.860]   to own this app in the United States?
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.740]   Of course, he would. I think my point would be the same, which
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.340]   is I want to see some proof. Hold on, let me make a couple of
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.620]   points. Number one, I want to see some proof that this is
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:54.660]   actually spyware. That to me has been alleged. And if it's as
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:58.140]   such a slam dunk case, as you say, why is there no proof of
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.960]   this? So that's point number one. And by the way, if if the
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.100]   phone is just sitting there passively listening to you, and
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.940]   that's the spyware, Apple should really address that, because
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.140]   apps shouldn't be able to do that. Right? So that's like
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.060]   Apple's problem. With respect to the data, supposedly being
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.900]   leaked to the Communist Party. Again, I want to see what data
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.460]   we talking about, like, like what to talk videos I like what
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.700]   what's important about that data. There are bundles of data
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.700]   that are available on the open market that they can buy about
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.180]   users.
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.860]   I don't think that's what it is. These microphones are on 24
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.400]   seven, these apps are allowed to passively listen in the
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.020]   background, though, I would just tell Apple not to allow that.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:43.860]   Think that that could be a partial solve to what about
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:44.300]   Android
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.100]   should not be passively listening to you should have to
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.400]   like stick in your face and talk to it if you want to activate
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:49.940]   the microphone.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.520]   The problem is when you download these apps, you create these
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.920]   settings. And so you try to you have to try to convince 100
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.760]   million people that, hey, you shouldn't do that. Maybe you
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.380]   should only do it when you use the app in a specific way. And
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.300]   it kills the usability. And so people get lazy. And they're
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.340]   like, default on
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.160]   look, what I'm saying here is that the way the microphone
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:08.800]   should work
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:14.560]   on Apple products is that I think it does work that way.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.120]   Yeah, it shouldn't work that way. I don't know if that's
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.540]   okay. Listening is like the key issue here. Well, I mean, who
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.160]   knows what's possible in terms of hacking and spyware. You know,
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.500]   those are all, you know, unknowns. So
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.620]   okay, so so one by one, we're kind of knocking, knocking out
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:35.920]   all these issues. It's not passively listening. The data
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.320]   that we don't know, we don't know, it doesn't seem that
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.800]   important. With respect to steering, I agree. I guess
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.520]   that's a theoretical problem. But you could say that about any
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.800]   of these apps, and you're on a slippery slope to basically a
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.400]   First Amendment problem, because they're not letting users get
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.660]   the content that they actually want.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.880]   All right, like,
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.800]   and then and then look, and then one final point about the
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.640]   reciprocity argument is, if you want to make this about
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:06.460]   reciprocity, then put it in a trade bill. That's where you
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.500]   deal with reciprocity is you say, okay, these products from
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.580]   China gets to play in US markets, our products to the
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.860]   United States gets play in Chinese markets, you do it
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:18.380]   through a trade bill. This is not a trade bill. This gives a
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:21.540]   new power to the government to define foreign adversary
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.840]   controlled applications or websites.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.500]   February want to give you a chance to answer the two
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.240]   questions. Are you in favor of divestiture? If it was Iran who
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.980]   owned the app, would you feel differently?
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   I don't know about divestiture. Until to Saksa's point, I just I
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.720]   haven't heard a clear point of view or clear, like piece of
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.000]   information about what this app uniquely does that other apps
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.320]   don't do. That creates a threat. It's just not clear to me. So in
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.240]   general, I'm not in fan of like forcing companies to divest and
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.600]   forcing things to be shut down and taking away human consumer
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.540]   choice. I just don't think those are good things generally. Okay,
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.180]   and I'm not to Saksa's point, I'm just not compelled that
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.880]   there's something here based on what I've seen. And then like if
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.440]   Iran own tik tok, I don't care who owns it based on my prior
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.620]   statement, I think people should have choice to use what they
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.680]   want to use a provided that there is no spying. If there's
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.360]   spying, I want to know that there's spying and how it's
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.880]   happening. We need to technically fix that if someone
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.800]   can passively turn on a microphone on an app and listen
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.920]   to people in a room. Yeah, pretty smart scientists, we've
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.160]   we've proven that it's possible and they can also we should fix
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.840]   that. That's a bigger problem, then you need to shut down all
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.920]   the iPhones we have with there's an Israeli software company. We
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.280]   all know what it's called. We all can go and license the
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.760]   software from them. Okay, they they will help you do this. So
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.160]   yeah, I'm sorry, guys. But that's an Apple needs to patch
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.880]   it. That's exactly right. That's how I don't want a domestic app
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.400]   to be able to do that to me. Yeah, exactly. It is happening
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.960]   and it hasn't been fixed. And it's not that it hasn't been
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.800]   fixed. The point is, when you have a large technical surface
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.160]   area, you guys know this, there are bugs all the time, like we
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.000]   deal with, for example, thread factors all the time into like,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.400]   Microsoft has dealt with these for 50 years, right? Every new
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.720]   update of Windows, every little thing has all of these little
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.000]   backdoors and little threads that weren't cleaned up
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.680]   properly. So this is an ongoing whack a mole problem. And the
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.760]   reality is that a very small technical team has an always
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.680]   been able to stay a few steps ahead of Apple, and many of
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.280]   these apps. And all I'm saying is, you should just not be so
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.160]   naive as to assume that this Apple is something that this is
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.400]   something Apple can fix. I think that a small talented team of
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.320]   hackers, whoever they work for, will always be able to find
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.920]   these backdoors in every single new release of every single
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.040]   operating system. And they will be a few steps ahead. So
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.640]   that we're screwed anyway, because all the data is already
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.200]   out there. So I think the point is, so knowing that, if you want
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.240]   to maybe minimize the surface area of how bad this data leaks
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.520]   to just the foreign actors that have infiltrated our American
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.520]   companies, you can ban tick tock. Okay. If you want to just
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.040]   open the door to it, keep it around. Look, I like I said at
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.960]   the beginning, I'm ambivalent about this, because if you can
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.280]   prove to me that there's really a national security threat, and
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.240]   that your remedy for dealing with it is narrowly tailored,
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.560]   then I'm potentially on board with this. But I don't believe
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.640]   the threat has been proven. And I certainly don't think the
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.040]   remedy is narrowly tailored. In fact, it's expansive, and it's
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.640]   going to lead to weaponization. And I don't trust the government
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:36.360]   to define new new categories of foreign controlled applications
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.080]   and websites.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.600]   I think you're probably right, which is the unfortunate part.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.640]   But I do think that there's enough of these folks that have
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.720]   been read into something that we're not being told.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.160]   And I have zero faith in that.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.480]   Yeah, I'm not I'm not gonna say that it's accurate or not. But
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.080]   I'm saying, I suspect that some body of work from a three letter
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.920]   agency has made its way to enough of these people under
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.240]   confidentiality, where they've all agreed,
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.400]   the national security state has a secret reason for wanting to
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.600]   expand its powers. That just doesn't fill me with any
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.040]   confidence. Again, Patriot Act 2.0. That's where I started with
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.080]   this. I don't think this is the Patriot Act, because the Patriot
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.240]   Act was like, I'm going to have now a broad license to probe
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.360]   anything I want. This is about saying, this thing that is here
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.480]   can no longer be here.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:29.800]   So it's not focused on Tick Tock. It's focused on, again,
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.920]   first, what I'm saying is, applications, websites,
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.800]   the Patriot Act was about the government being able to go
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.040]   proactively wherever they wanted when they weren't allowed. That
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.600]   is not what this bill says this bill is more reactive and
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:49.160]   saying, Okay, you out, out of the sandbox. And all I'm saying
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.440]   is you're right that that could be abused. But that's very
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.160]   different than the Patriot Act, which was very aggressive.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:01.720]   All right. So they have folks, two people looks like agree with
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.240]   the divestiture. Two people have a difference of opinion.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.560]   Well, I don't agree with the divestiture. I think it should
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   be shut down. Okay, shut down. Yeah. So shut down divestiture.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.920]   Looks like lots of opinions. That's good. Lots of opinions.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.680]   That's good. Okay. I think we just had more debate over this
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.040]   than the entire US Congress did.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.120]   Perhaps. I mean, I think that's why people listen to this
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.520]   program is because we're literally getting into the
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.560]   absolute finest details and asking really probing questions
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.960]   sex that you love 100 million people are soon gonna be asking
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.160]   when Tick Tock gets shut down 100 million people who used it
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.320]   every day are gonna be like, why did this happen?
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.240]   I'm gonna say something about that. One of my kids and I'm not
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:43.720]   gonna say who it is. We recently had them tested for ADHD. They
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:48.360]   weren't doing particularly great in school. The response by some
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.360]   of the folks in the school was Oh, there's meds for that. We're
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:59.280]   like no meds. And what we did was we took away their iPad. And
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.040]   we completely deprived them of all these apps and video games.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.280]   I cannot describe to you the magnitude of the turnaround in
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:16.960]   this kid. grades. Incredible word, they were getting 60% and
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:23.200]   70% now getting 90% totally engaged, interesting, charming
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:28.000]   kid that had lost a little bit. And I think that there was a
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.160]   little bit of a daze. And I just want to say that in general as a
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.200]   parent, whether the app is banned or not, who cares my lived
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.600]   experience right now is that video games and these apps are
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.680]   horrible for kids.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.960]   This is a known fact actually, Jamal, I looked into this as
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.920]   well. It turns out students who used iPads and digital media
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.200]   many times a day, they show the exact signs of ADHD inattention
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.800]   and hyperactivity and impulsivity. So whether you
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.320]   think it's a real diagnosis or not, it's inducing those
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.000]   symptoms.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.200]   I'm willing to say that my child probably had a very light form
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.240]   of it. Maybe it was exacerbated by these video games and the
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.560]   iPad. And these apps and you know, they were getting all the
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:20.200]   tick tock content. But they were getting it on YouTube alerts,
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.880]   all this anyways, went to zero, not like you can have a little
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.960]   bit here, they're zero. And the transformation in this last
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.480]   month and a half, two months has been incredible. I don't know if
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.920]   other parents are dealing with this. But what I'll tell you is
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.160]   these apps are not good. So this whole consumer choice thing, I
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.840]   think my view is a little tainted, because I get agitated
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.520]   as a responsible parent, I'm like, just get this app out of
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.760]   here. And I already know that I'm addicted to it. And it's not
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.720]   good for me. I have no idea what it's doing to my, my kids. And I
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.800]   just don't want to deal with it.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.000]   If you if you look at the correlation between all of these
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.720]   symptoms showing up in kids, it's basically the introduction
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:01.080]   of the iPhone. And so people are kind of reaching consensus that
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:05.040]   the iPhone and distraction, ADHD, spiking, depression, all
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.600]   this stuff, anxiety, and kids is correlating with too much
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.040]   screen time. You can do your own research, folks.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.840]   Maybe it correlates with prescription of SSRIs. Maybe it
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:20.240]   well, no, that is part of it with schools going totally woke
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.640]   and bananas. I call it a lot of things.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.920]   The COVID exacerbated correlates COVID exacerbated it when you
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.400]   look at the the trend lines for sure. And the SSRIs and those
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:37.440]   kind of things being prescribed is probably as a result of these
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.960]   ADHD symptoms coming from screen time. And then it's probably
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.680]   unnecessary.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:45.200]   I think people just got a lot more prescription happy, like
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.040]   they're just definitely that over prescription. They're
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.520]   willing to put kids on drugs for I mean, you talk about ADHD for
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.280]   young boys, that's kind of like this normal behavior.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:58.480]   Yeah, no, absolutely. Like, kids running around outside and
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.920]   having energy. If I had to pick an age, I would say 16 1718 years
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.360]   old for social media. And for phones, I would say 15 or 16.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.160]   You know, with a very controlled phone. So as this is one
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.680]   person's opinion. All right, Florida's on the verge of
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.200]   banning lab grown meat. Freebird. Can you tee this up
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:14.560]   for us?
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.120]   Yeah, so Florida has been debating a bill in their state
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.080]   legislature since November. And it just passed the house and the
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:28.440]   Senate vote of 8627 in the house 2820 in the Senate to prohibit
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:32.400]   the manufacturing sale, holding or distribution of cultivated
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.440]   meat. And it basically makes the sale or ownership of cultivated
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.760]   meat a second degree misdemeanor. This is lab grown
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:46.960]   meat. And this bill is now on to Santa's desk for signing. You
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.280]   know, I'll kind of highlight a little bit of the motivation and
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.080]   and some of the technical background and my point of view
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.960]   on it. If that's okay, but do you do you see him eating the
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.600]   meat while you're talking about it? Did you see the beach? I'm
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.640]   paying attention. Unlike you guys. He's got this like
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.680]   Flintstone size ham hock. We're all this and good. It feels like
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.960]   a like a non issue to folks who eat meat and don't care. But I
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.400]   just want to point out how much of this is generally a challenge
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:17.000]   to enabling choice in new innovative technology, which you
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.200]   know, we've seen attempts at this in the past. But what is
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:24.080]   the reason with you? What is the reason to ban lab grown meat?
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.920]   They love to ban in Florida. The motivation is that Florida
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.320]   ranchers felt the guy who just has been advocating for banning
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.920]   Tick Tock this whole show is now accusing Florida of being into
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:40.280]   banning your boy loves to bitch. I'm the only person on this pod
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.080]   who actually free burgers to who are skeptical of like, does
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.360]   knee jerk banning everything, ban everything? I would not ban
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:50.240]   this. I didn't say to ban everything. Where's that?
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.800]   We're just joking. We're joking. Don't label me with your J cal
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.360]   brush.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.040]   Let's say bad everything.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.880]   I just definitely becoming a minority position to be against
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.640]   government intervention in free decision making and commerce by
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:10.240]   individual citizens. Florida ranchers felt that their
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.640]   livelihood was threatened. They have a billion dollar ranching
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:15.880]   business a year in Florida. Good for them. They should go ahead
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:19.000]   and compete with whatever new technology is emerging. I would
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.520]   say try a little role reversal. Imagine if you know, governments
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.560]   and states tried to ban the use of the tractor for fear of
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.000]   putting agricultural workers out of business, or you know,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.120]   software companies that did accounting software got banned,
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:35.640]   because it could put accountants out of business, or electric car
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.480]   production and use got banned, because it could put traditional
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.360]   automotive manufacturers out of business, you could go down the
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.160]   list, and you could create this position on nearly any new or
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.960]   emerging technology that feels threatening to an incumbent
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.240]   industry. And ultimately, it really only yields to regulatory
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.480]   capture, and to a lack of choice, and opportunity for new
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.080]   innovation and for consumers to make decisions about what they
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.120]   want. And the irony here is that so much of what's being consumed
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.720]   in the market space today, part of their their rationalization
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.400]   is, oh, well, it's new technology. We don't know if
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.840]   it's good for you. We don't know if it's going to work. The truth
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.320]   is, there are federal regulatory bodies that have oversight on
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.880]   this sort of thing. 20 years ago, almost all the cheese that
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.280]   we ate in the United States was made from rennet. rennet is an
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.560]   enzyme that converts the protein and milk into cheese. We got
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.800]   rennet from the stomach of calves, we would scrape it out
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.000]   and sell rennet and it would be used to make cheese. Then
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.040]   recombinant engineering where we could put we could get bacteria
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:37.200]   or yeast cells to make proteins. This technology unlocked the
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:40.360]   opportunity to make rennet more affordably. So rather than go
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.120]   and slaughter calves and get the rennet out of their stomach, we
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.640]   engineer the bacteria or the yeast cell to make the exact
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.640]   same protein. And that is now the entirety of the rennet
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.400]   industry is recombinantly produced rennet. And the
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.720]   entirety of cheese that we all consume is made using this
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.720]   genetically modified yeast that makes this enzyme that converts
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:01.080]   milk into cheese. The same is true across other industries. We
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.240]   used to use animal fat for laundry detergent turned out it
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:07.600]   was a lot cheaper to make enzymes using the same process I
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.200]   just described instead of making animal fat. And now all of our
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:13.280]   laundry detergent is recombinant enzymes. So I think like this
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.240]   notion that we're going to ban this stuff is a regulatory
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:20.560]   capture incumbency moment. It's totally wrong. It denies
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:24.160]   consumers choice. And frankly, it flies in the face of what has
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.280]   historically been a real economic opportunity to bring
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.120]   cost down to bring new innovation to market and to try
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.120]   and stall out innovation is going to leave the state or this
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.400]   country. You're right in a real kind of challenge compared to
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.480]   other countries. I just think it's wrong. I think it's really
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:42.280]   on this topic. You are 100% right. You're right. This is a
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:46.680]   dumb thing to legislate. And it is meaningless and unimpactful.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.680]   And people should just decide based on what tastes better.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.000]   It's that's different than a listening device or cheaper.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.720]   freeberg is it is the criticism of this that it's regulatory
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.960]   capture, or it's part of like this anti woke kind of vibes in
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:04.520]   Florida,
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.960]   there's a conservative movement in Florida, which has taken
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.760]   hold, which I think this is key to. Now, in some ways, I would
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.520]   argue that conservative movement has really important sociological
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:21.920]   points of view. In other cases, I think it denies necessary
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.200]   innovation, it denies necessary advancement to move industry
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.000]   forward versus social change. And I think the the ability to
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.520]   kind of obfuscate the two that Oh, you know, transgenderism in
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:36.280]   schools and elementary schools is the same as the woke leftists
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.280]   from California, making, you know, lab grown meat, and they
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.760]   all get kind of jammed together as one big tribal group. And
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.760]   therefore, we should ban it all. What will likely end up
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.320]   happening here is this will find its path to federal preemption.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.800]   Historically, when we've seen states try to impose these
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.120]   sorts of bans, the companies that are ultimately affected the
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.120]   innovators that are affected, go to the federal government, and
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.680]   they try and legislate for a bill that says this stuff is
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.000]   legal and should be broadly available. That federal
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.680]   preemption then stop states rights on having a ban in place.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.040]   And so it's very likely that we'll end up seeing some
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.400]   legislation here over the next couple of years. If this
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.720]   technology is ultimately beneficial. The problem is now
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.840]   that Florida has done this, I guarantee you're going to see
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.040]   Texas, which is a huge ranching state, and many other states
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.600]   step up to do it, it creates a really bad precedent for all
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.920]   other disruptive kind of industries to be blocked by
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:27.020]   their local economies that that believe that they're under
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:29.800]   threat. And, you know, it just creates like a lot of
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.240]   unnecessary chaos. So
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.000]   sacks, what is the sentences be with fake meat?
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.640]   I don't know. I don't know. But let me let me state clearly what
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.320]   I think, which is I think it's really terrible. When a bunch of
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.360]   incumbents in an industry get together, and try to shut out
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.600]   the innovative solution by inventing some unproven threat
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.000]   that they turn into some sort of
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.040]   Tick Tock.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.720]   Right, but exactly. But
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.200]   I can see that coming around the corner.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.240]   I wanted to talk about this, because I think the two are so
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.360]   similar. And they're not similar at all. Well, they're not
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.920]   just go ahead. So regulatory captures regulatory capture. But
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:09.600]   this is a far
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.920]   that's just the term of art. We're just you know, fair enough.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.680]   Yeah, we disagree on Yeah, that's fair. I think you guys
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.560]   have to have the intellectual honesty to say these are
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.640]   different issues. One is lab grown meat versus ranchers in
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.480]   America. This is typical corruption and cronyism. Fine,
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.720]   whatever. Okay.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.960]   Oh, yeah. But you don't think you don't think that the the
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.360]   other tech companies that compete with Tick Tock are
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.320]   secretly banning together to basically gin up this bill.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.840]   I don't think I don't think they're secretly banning. I
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.200]   think that they're being over there overtly organizing.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.960]   Yeah, just like the ranchers.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.840]   But again, that typically still always gets cut on partisan
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.440]   lines. And what I'm saying is this is totally different than
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.240]   lab grown meat versus ranchers.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.800]   I just want to say one thing, the
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.960]   knowledge, the similarities.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.400]   I think I just want to make a point here. I think the
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.880]   intellectual discourse on this program is second to none. I
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.960]   mean, we are getting into the most refined details of this
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.400]   issue. And you just don't hear this anywhere else. So I just
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.320]   want to give myself and the rest of the crew a pat on the back.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.000]   You just want to ask a bit. I just want to Yeah, no, I mean,
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.480]   we really did get in a pretty in the weeds here.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.720]   J Cal, do you agree that the Florida bill is ridiculous? And
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.920]   that it sets a terrible precedent?
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:26.920]   I didn't read it. But I would think that's exactly there's
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.240]   nothing special about it. I can't imagine why somebody would
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.960]   want to ban mock meat other than crony capitalism, of course. And
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.200]   my question to you is when is this going to taste good? When
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.240]   are you gonna make this mock me?
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.440]   Well, by the way, this bill makes no sense. Because the
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.600]   only reason they would do it is if they were afraid that the lab
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.160]   grown meat was just so much cheaper. And frankly, so much
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.000]   tastier than what they make. And Freiburg, you've you've said
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.360]   this many times, like, we are so like orders of magnitude away
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.760]   totally. Yeah, we're 10 years out. But
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:01.240]   but by the way, why try and stop it from competing? Let the VCs
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.200]   that want to throw money at it, throw money at it, let the
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.640]   scientists pursue it. Let the let the thing that's made
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.800]   America so successful, be successful. By the way, imagine
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.800]   Elon got the Starship up today. You guys saw this thing and went
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:18.360]   into orbit. It was incredible. Imagine if Boeing and a bunch of
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.080]   defense contractors got together 10 years ago and said we got to
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:24.200]   stop SpaceX. These guys are trying to do stuff in an unsafe
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.040]   way. We don't try and they tried and they tried and they will
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.680]   keep trying. And the freedom that we afford people and
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.720]   businesses in the United States of America is what allows us to
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.000]   have our unique edge and our unique ability to create
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.400]   progress that you don't see anywhere else on planet Earth.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.480]   And this is the sort of that takes us backwards. I just had
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.600]   the key word we us America, America, back to the tick tock
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.760]   thing. That's not an us thing. That's a Chinese thing. I get
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:53.360]   the point. I'm not like, I'm not pro CCP. But yeah, I get the
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:57.080]   point. Anything American? God bless us. Let's go American
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:00.080]   exceptionalism. No, I saw the headlines. I think CNBC reported
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.920]   that the rocket blew up on entry reentry.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:08.480]   I mean, they didn't say that, did they? I saw one headline
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.720]   where they had to put a little nag in the end of the sentence
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:15.240]   or a starling starling video for like an hour. It's not video
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:19.360]   was so crystal clear. It was like HD of this rocket coming
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.880]   back down to Earth. It was bonkers. So congrats to E.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:26.440]   Can I show you guys the most incredible tweet related to
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.560]   this? I'm just gonna send this to you, Nick.

[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:39.160]   million about twice the cost of sharkship. Today, today, Ilan
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.680]   made the entire human race multi planetary. Yeah. And it costs
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:49.560]   half as much as what Google spends on food. That's
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:53.720]   incredible. It does seem like a lot of money to spend on food. I
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.160]   don't know. It doesn't seem like these rockets take two or three.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.440]   The new each time there's a new platform, it seems to take you
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.360]   on exactly like two or three to nail it. And here we are
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:06.080]   again, you know, you know, congrats to our boy. Great job.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.880]   This is going back full circle, the persistence and the
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:12.000]   resilience that was needed to get this thing to happen. It's
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.680]   just like 20 years of step by step iterative, nothing about
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:21.040]   the initial kind of instantiation or concept of, you
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.440]   know, what SpaceX needed to walk to get here was right, everything
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.920]   had to change along the way Starlink came along, etc, etc.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:31.120]   And here he is at the end of this period of time, with this
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.440]   incredible craft, the largest object to ever fly in outer
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.480]   space, it really is like an incredible moment in human
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.280]   history. And it took the degree of persistence, resilience, that
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.520]   was, I think, marks what makes American entrepreneurship so
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.920]   powerful. It really is an incredible day. It was an
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.240]   amazing thing to watch. I don't know if any of you guys have
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.880]   ever gone watch and watch any of the old Saturn launches on
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.160]   YouTube. But I think this is a new era. It's really incredible.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.360]   I think this was like five or six years ago. I got cleared to
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:05.160]   basically fly and hug Radenberg when they were doing a launch.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.800]   And so I was able to see it as the thing like kind of like,
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.920]   tried to approach Max Q it's one of the most incredible things
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.960]   I've ever done. So I think we made some progress. If you look
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:21.000]   at the Google News links. A lot of praise for this launch soon.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.080]   Yeah, looks like people are kind of getting it. Yeah, just
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.240]   incredible. I mean, this thing is so huge. I don't know if
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.240]   you've ever been inside of one of these things. But the the
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.160]   starships Yeah, I've been inside. I was inside the first
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.960]   one they built. It is so large. The capacity of this thing is
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:43.440]   like, think you could fit like three, four or 500 human beings
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.280]   inside of it.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.600]   Maybe when we do our our Austin poker night, we can stop over
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.460]   and see it be really walkers. And when you see it stacked, the
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:57.380]   height is like, it almost feels like you're looking at CGI and
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:01.600]   real in the real world. It is incredibly tall, like incredibly
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.180]   tall. All right, listen, this is your favorite podcast in the
