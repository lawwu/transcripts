[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]   the four wealth generators of real estate.
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.920]   So one of them is appreciation.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.700]   Real estate goes up.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.000]   Number two, real estate gets paid down when you have a mortgage, which is great.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   That's the whole leverage piece.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.240]   Number three, though, is the cashflow.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.860]   I'll get to have a nicer car because of that.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.780]   I can use that for my life and that's why I love cashflow.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.900]   So cashflow is the third reason.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560]   And the fourth wealth generator of real estate is the tax benefit.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.760]   When I make $1,500 a month on cashflow, I pay $0 in taxes on that.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.120]   You make $1,500 doing a W-2 job, not you, but somebody does.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600]   And they're going to pay $500, $600 in taxes, whatever.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.080]   Not only do you have the three areas where you're growing wealthier, but
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.480]   the fourth area is that there's so many tax strategies for real estate
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.800]   investors that you typically will pay little to no tax as long as
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.640]   you're investing in real estate.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.200]   So combine those four things together.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.920]   And it's a phenomenal return that I think can blow out any business, any
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.360]   investment, any way to generate wealth completely out of the water.
