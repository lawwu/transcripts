[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua,
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.040]   and today we're going to focus on living a meaningful life. And we're going to do it
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.640]   in the context of speaking about death. Woke up early this morning and got the news that
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.280]   a friend of mine, someone I've known my entire life, passed away this morning, early this morning
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.040]   due to COVID. And kind of the normal complications from COVID, had been in the hospital for the last
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.320]   few weeks, been on a ventilator for a couple of weeks and things took a turn, you know,
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.720]   just steadily declining. And he passed away early this morning. Wasn't entirely unexpected
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.680]   for reasons that I'll elaborate on in just a moment. And so I've been thinking a lot about
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.840]   his death this morning. And it's something that is impactful for me personally, although probably not
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.520]   in the way that you would expect. And I'll share with you why his death is so impactful to me.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.960]   And I'll share with you why in the context of talking about money and living a life well,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.360]   the context of financial planning, because it's appropriate and it's part of even
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.560]   what his life means to me. And so I want to share this with you as a way of even just for me
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.240]   articulating some things that I have thought about for many years. My friend's death this
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   morning is quite painful to me, but not in the ways that you might imagine. He was in his mid
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.120]   to late 60s, which is not particularly young, right? It wasn't such a tragic thing like when
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.880]   you go to the death of a 10 year old or something like that, go to a funeral. But I'll explain in
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.800]   just a moment why his death for me is very painful. And again, it's not why you might think.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.760]   I don't generally mind going to funerals. I don't want to go to them, of course not,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.560]   none of us do. But I don't usually mind going to funerals. I don't dread going to funerals.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.520]   Generally, there's even times when I enjoy going to funerals. I find it very satisfying to go to
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.600]   funerals of old people. I like to go to old people funerals. I think it's very satisfying to go and
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.440]   to gather when somebody dies, to gather together with friends and family and relatives and hear
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   about the meaning of that person's life. I like to listen to the stories of what Bob did for so
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.440]   and so or what so and so did for this person. I like to listen to those stories and think about
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.040]   how I can apply the lessons in my own life. I like to go to funerals because I think about my own
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.760]   death and I think about what my funeral is going to be like, and it helps me to keep clearly in
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.840]   mind the fact that the days are short and none of us knows when our last day is. I don't find
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.040]   funerals particularly discomforting because of my Christian worldview. I have a firm confidence that
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.280]   God is the one who ordained death. He's the one who is on both sides of death. He's the one who
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.200]   has conquered death at the cross and proved his power over death by raising Jesus Christ from the
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.640]   dead. So that brings me tremendous confidence that God is there. I have confidence in God's
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.080]   sovereignty over the world and that he controls all things. He knows the date of all of our death.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.120]   And so for me, I don't have any fear over death, and I recognize that death is a universal
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.240]   experience, right? All of us will pass through death at some point. And so when I think about
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.080]   that, I don't find death particularly troubling. It is often tragic and difficult when we go to
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.040]   those deaths that are tragic. Usually young people or people who died in a particularly tragic way
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.960]   where we feel the pain of death much more intensely. Those are hard. Those are harder.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.360]   But even in those times, my Christian faith gives me the comfort to know that whether or not I
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.960]   understand God is in control and in the fullness of time, all things will be revealed. And since
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.280]   he's a good God and I can trust him, then I don't need to worry about the temporary, the pain,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.000]   the things that seem tragic. And I've done enough philosophical homework that I'm not bothered by
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.720]   intellectually, I'm not bothered by the difficulty of evil, etc. Those intellectual questions are
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.560]   fully resolved in my mind. Doesn't mean that there's not pain associated, of course, but
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.360]   the intellectual questions, the philosophical questions are clearly and fully resolved.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   And so I don't mind going to funerals. In fact, again, when they're old people funerals
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.920]   or mature people's funerals, I generally like to go to them because I like to go and remember my
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.480]   friends or my family members. I like to hear the stories and I like to reflect on the meaning of
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.960]   life. I like to reflect on what life meant, what this person's life meant. And at a funeral, you
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.560]   get to see in a very clear way what this person's life meant as people gather together to celebrate
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   their life. And so I don't find usually a deep level of pain when somebody dies the way that
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.080]   other things are. Now, it's harder, of course, when someone's close to you. I'm not saying that
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.360]   I don't experience the emotions that we all do, just saying that I'm not particularly bothered by
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.520]   thinking about death or funerals. And so when my friend passed away, it didn't give me pain
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:51.040]   over the fact that he had died. What gave me pain was the fact that I feel like he almost never
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.520]   really lived. And that's a harsh and difficult thing to say about somebody that you've known
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.960]   literally your entire life. And somebody who died in their mid-late 60s, 67, 68 years old,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.520]   something like that. It's a hard and harsh thing to say, and yet it is a true thing.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   It sounds extraordinarily uncharitable to say something so harsh about a friend,
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   someone that you care about. And yet it is true. I feel like my friend wasted his life.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.080]   And so as I've been reflecting this morning, I've been considering why do I think that,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.440]   and is it true? First of all, is it true or am I just being uncharitable? But is it true? And
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.040]   if I think that, why? And what do I need to do to not waste my life? Because I don't want to arrive
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.120]   at the end of my days and have someone say, "Well, Joshua died," from whatever,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.040]   and I feel like Joshua wasted his life. To me, that's utterly unacceptable. I don't want that.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:04.480]   And I doubt you do either. And so it's important to reflect on the examples that we see around us
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.600]   and consider them. And usually I think it's very productive for us to consider the examples of
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   people that have won, people that have been successful. We don't necessarily always go
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.480]   and study failures if we want to learn how to run a business. You go and find people who have
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.240]   been successful with business. Go and find people who have been successful as parents and study them
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.560]   and model their behavior. But I also feel like it is actually valuable to study failures. It is
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.240]   actually valuable to study a business that goes into bankruptcy and say, "Why did this end up
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.800]   there?" It is valuable, and I do it, to study a parent who winds up isolated from their children
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.360]   or with a bad relationship with their children and say, "How did it happen?" And I try to ask
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   the questions, even when I can and when it's appropriate, "What did you do? What happened here?
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.520]   Do you have any understanding and insight?" And so when somebody arrives at the end of their life
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.120]   and someone who knows them well and who loves them much and who has known them their entire life
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.080]   thinks to themselves, "What a waste of a life." To me, that's an example worth studying. So I want
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.920]   to tell you about it even as I process it. I want to be quick to start with some of the things that
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.240]   I do appreciate about my friend. First, of course, he and I had a very long relationship. There are
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.080]   pictures of him shaking me on his knee when I was a baby. Shaking me on his knee, that didn't come
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.600]   out quite right. Bouncing me on his knee when I was a baby. And so I have known him literally my
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.240]   entire life. And we have always lived somewhat close to each other, even to the point where
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.480]   for a period of years I was his next door neighbor. I've always known him. I've always
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.960]   had a good relationship. He was in the church that I grew up in and I've had a relationship
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:49.120]   with him for many years. And so it wasn't something where I was far from him. I've never
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.000]   had any conflict with him personally. There's never been a point in time where we've had an
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.480]   argument or we've had a fight or anything like that. My friend was not particularly into conflict.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.360]   He was more of a person who would turn from conflict and shut down rather than, he wasn't a
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.120]   fighter. He was somebody who would avoid conflict. My friend was always very nice. He was always
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:19.760]   kind. I've never heard him speak harshly to anybody. He was generally kind and he was sometimes
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.840]   helpful. He would do things from time to time to help. He was the kind of person where if you
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:30.480]   invited him over he would bring over something for dinner, etc. But he was always a loner. And
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.040]   I worked hard for years when he was my next door neighbor. I spent a lot of time with him
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.360]   trying to understand a little bit about his past. And we would spend a lot of time together. I'd
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.000]   probe him to try to understand about his past. I think there was some pain and some trauma
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.800]   from his childhood that was probably never resolved. He never shared with me all the
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.080]   details, but the signs were there indicating that there was some pain, some significant pain that
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.160]   he endured. He was in the military as a young man, got out of the military, and after the military
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   just basically worked a series of jobs, a series of very simple jobs. He went from one thing to
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.080]   another. He wasn't a drifter. He was a loyal person. It wasn't somebody who would just be
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.720]   switching jobs every six months. He was generally competent enough at the things that he would do.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.840]   He would develop the basic skills that he needed and he would be basically competent at what he
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.280]   was doing. But he never particularly had a lot of ambition. He never had a lot of drive. He wasn't
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:36.160]   a go-getter. And so he wasn't particularly driven to enhance himself, to grow. He was always quiet,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.280]   reserved, was not the kind of person who would talk a lot. He wasn't the kind of person – and
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.120]   he wasn't weird about it. You know, if I had him over for dinner, I could get him talking.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.320]   If we would spend time together, I could get him talking. But he wasn't someone who would
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.960]   stand up and, you know, take charge. He wasn't somebody who would ever take leadership. He would
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:11:02.000]   always kind of pull back and pull back and not press forward. With his career, which is important
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.360]   for what I have to say from a financial planning context, again, he never really developed a career.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.920]   He worked a series of jobs at one point in time. I think it's one of his longer running jobs. He
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.640]   worked as a washing machine repair tech. There was a business that repaired appliances and he
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.960]   worked as a technician repairing appliances. He was good. He understood things. He had a good
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.280]   mechanical mind and he was able to do that. He was smart. He didn't have – I wouldn't say – I don't
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.240]   know his IQ, but he wasn't – he was the kind of person who was perfectly smart and perfectly
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:40.480]   normal. He wasn't slow or dim-witted in any way. He was smart. He was capable and he was capable.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.000]   I don't know all the circumstances of his earlier life. At some point in time, he had – at one
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.480]   point in time, he had gotten a job working as an assistant for an accountant, did that for a number
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.360]   of years until the accountant moved and then he lost that job because the accountant moved.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:02.240]   He got a job and then towards later in his life, when he was in his late 50s, he had gotten a job
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:10.000]   where he was working for a car dealership processing applications on – processing
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.280]   paperwork for the car dealership. And then he got into an interpersonal argument,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.480]   tiff with the – his manager and he was fired from that job when he was about 60 years old.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.240]   At that time, he didn't have much money and he was unemployed for quite a while,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.800]   but he never developed the confidence and never had the go-gettiveness to go out and
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:40.240]   get another job. And this was one of the few times in my life where I strongly spoke to him and I
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:47.600]   tried to give him some counsel. And I became aware of the fact – financially, he would never – he
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.200]   didn't talk much about certain things. There was a point in his life where he had gone deeply into
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.360]   debt – he had – when he had had a stable income, he'd lived a modest lifestyle. He always rented a
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.920]   small room, he rented a small house, kept his expenses modest. There was a time in his life
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.000]   where he bought a bunch of cars and then he eventually realized the error of his ways and
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.040]   stopped buying all these cars. He had, I would say, certain kind of tendencies of fixation.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.360]   I think – I personally think there's a very good chance he was somewhere on the autism spectrum
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.520]   where he would get fixated with certain things. And so, you know, he'd get fixated with audio
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.080]   equipment and buy a bunch of fancy audio equipment. And he went into credit card debt at one point in
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.560]   time with overspending, didn't work for a period of time, went into credit card debt. Then he had
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.360]   a bunch of medical debt and then later declared bankruptcy and cleared the credit card debt.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.080]   And then after that he was living on a very small budget. He later went on and when he was 62,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.160]   he applied for early social security, early retirement with social security.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:55.520]   And I remember at the time I strongly, strongly – I don't – I have learned in life not to
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.480]   interfere in other people's affairs. I used to butt my nose into other people's business.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.440]   These days I desperately try not to. Imperfectly, I would guess, right? When you really love someone
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.240]   and really care about them, sometimes it just feels like you have to go and speak and say what
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.640]   you think somebody needs to know or somebody needs to hear. And I don't think that's necessarily
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.160]   wrong. But in general I've just taught myself don't give my opinion unless it's asked for
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.280]   and don't give it generally unless it's paid for. Because free advice, people don't value it.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.120]   And, you know, if they don't – if no one's asking you a question, they're not interested
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.840]   in an answer. But I remember very clearly that, again, we were close at the time. I had worked
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.560]   hard at building a relationship. I had spent a lot of time just trying to be a friend to him and
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:45.680]   trying to do things. And I became aware of the fact that he was going to apply for social security
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.480]   early retirement. And I begged him. I said, "Don't do it." I said, "Don't do it." I said,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.240]   "There's nothing wrong with you. There's no reason in the world why you can't get another job."
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.840]   I said, "You desperately need to go and get a job because you need to be – have that structure to
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:10.240]   your life. You need work." And I said, "Financially, if you get social security early retirement,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.000]   it's going to be a very small number. I don't know the exact number, but something on the order
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.560]   of less than – certainly less than $1,000 a month." I said, "You're going to be stuck and
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.160]   hamstrung for basically the rest of your life." I said, "Because you're going to have this tiny
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.120]   income that you've got to figure out how to survive on this tiny income, but you're not
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.960]   going to have any wiggle room. And so you're going to be trapped. You're not going to be able to have
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:38.080]   enough money to adjust, to grow, to change. You're going to be stuck. You're going to be trapped."
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:44.640]   And so I begged him not to do it. I begged him to get a job. But he didn't do it. He didn't go and
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:51.040]   get a job. Why is unknown. I think it was because he just didn't have the confidence to do it. He
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.280]   didn't have the personal confidence to go out and apply for a job. It's hard for people when they
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.080]   start to feel the age discrimination that people feel when they're starting to get in their 50s and
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.920]   their 60s. And it's especially hard for people – I mean, it's hard enough for people who are
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.320]   highly accomplished. But when someone is not highly accomplished, it's very difficult for them. And so
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.960]   he just never – he never kind of screwed up the courage to go out and do it. And so he got
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:23.040]   Social Security early retirement. And basically for – I would say that's about seven years ago now,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.800]   maybe seven years, six to seven years – he's basically just sat. He has sat in his house and
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.680]   done nothing for six or seven years. And lo and behold, he is now dead.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.360]   I am convinced that retirement kills so many people.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:50.960]   I know that sounds brash and hyperbolic. I don't believe it is. I believe it's accurate.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   I am convinced that retirement kills people because they lose a sense of meaning, they lose
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.400]   a sense of contribution, they lose a sense of connectedness with the world. And it causes them
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:09.520]   – it's a downward spiral, it's a downward slide. Hear me clearly. I am not saying that you can't
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:17.360]   stop working for wages and do something else, right? There are certainly many people who
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.120]   reach a certain age, they turn 65 years old, or they turn 60 years old, or whatever,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.040]   or 35 years old, who cares? Early retirement, doesn't matter. There are people who reach a
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.360]   certain point in time and they say, "I have accumulated enough money. I no longer want to do
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.720]   that for work, for money." But there has to be an answer of what they do want to do.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.040]   I want to go and do this. Now, this can be anything that you want. It can be working for
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.880]   wages if you want, it can be starting a business, it can be a hobby. But it has to be something that
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   you're going to do. There has to be something that you're retiring to, something that you're going to
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:05.360]   do that is calling to you so that you're going to be active and engaged. Now, I think that work is
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.960]   probably one of the best things for you to go and do. I don't think that we're designed for seven
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   days a week of leisure. And I'll use my friend as an example. We're not designed for it. We're
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:24.240]   designed for work, for labor, for concentration, for contribution. And it's important to have rest.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.680]   There's no problem with rest. There's no problem with leisure. There's no problem with relaxation.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.720]   But we're not designed for a lifestyle of rest. We're not designed for a lifestyle of leisure,
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:41.440]   for relaxation. That kind of lifestyle of just doing nothing will kill you, as it killed my
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:47.280]   friend. When I was talking with my wife last night, knowing my friend was in the hospital,
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.800]   we were just trying to talk. I was like, "Can we pray for him?" And I didn't sense the faith to
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.360]   pray for him. Not that he would be healed, right? I just sensed no faith, no faith whatsoever to
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:04.880]   pray for him. And she didn't either. And her comment was, "You know, I kind of feel like he
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.560]   wanted to die. I kind of feel like this is what he wanted." And I would say, "That's true. I think
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.960]   it's what he wanted." My friend never would have gone and committed suicide like some people do,
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:22.480]   but he was just sitting and doing nothing. And for six years he sat and done basically nothing.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.760]   I lived, again, I lived next door to him and I tried for years to engage with him. And I watched
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.360]   his life up front. Basically, he would sit, he would get up in the morning. He was a very
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.400]   structured guy. He would get up at a certain time, do his routine and whatnot. At the same,
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.440]   you know, cook his breakfast and kind of go through this very structured lifestyle that he
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.640]   would live. He would always go grocery shopping at 3.30 on Sunday afternoon. You know, regular
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.120]   clockwork. Look out the window, there he goes, go do his weekly grocery shopping, etc. So,
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.600]   very structured guy with regards to his personality. But he would just sit and watch TV,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:03.200]   Netflix. He would watch Netflix and he would just do things. YouTube and Netflix,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:12.640]   YouTube and Netflix, YouTube and Netflix. I guess I'm just sharing my frustration at
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.160]   having tried with whatever I could do to help someone and yet seeing how bound he was
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.160]   by those certain personality quirks. And what angers me,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:33.600]   angers me so much is when you get to the end of someone's life and they die. And you sit back
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:40.640]   and as a friend, somebody who cares about them, your honest assessment is kind of a wasted life.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.600]   That is a terrible feeling. That is a terrible feeling.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:21:01.200]   To reflect on the death of somebody that you cared about, that you knew, that you were friends with,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:08.160]   and get to the end and say that person wasted their life, that is a terrible testimony of a life.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.560]   Now, you may think I'm too harsh. I hope I'm not harsh. I hope I have...I
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.360]   know that I'm saying something that's hard. And usually we don't say things that are hard. I
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.680]   wouldn't go to a public funeral where there were friends and relatives of this man and
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:30.640]   say anything about him. But you know what? I don't think there's going to be any kind of funeral.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.400]   Why? Because he didn't impact anybody. He didn't touch anybody. He didn't connect with anybody.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   He didn't try. I'm not blaming him. None of us know the shoes, the path that another man has
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.840]   walked. If I were walking in his shoes, perhaps I would have lived exactly the same way. I don't
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.560]   know. I don't know what he had in his past. I don't know what he had in his present. I don't
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:02.000]   know the things that he wrestled with in his heart to overcome. I don't know. I did my best to engage
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.920]   with him and to be a friend to him and encourage him in everything that I saw, and I know so many
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:12.400]   others in my family and in the church and in the community that tried the same way and nothing ever
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.520]   seemed to be effective. What do you do except leave a man in God's hands, right? None of us
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.640]   are called on to give a final judgment about the meaning of another person's life.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.360]   So, I just want to share with you some lessons that I have, some observations that I have from
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:34.960]   my friend's life and some lessons that I have taken to heart for me and consider them for
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:43.040]   yourself. Number one, I asked myself the question, "Why do I feel like my friend wasted his life?"
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:53.840]   Reason number one is that he was a loner. He was a loner. Now, let me expand upon that because
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.360]   I try to be thoughtful in what I say. We all have different personality types. I'm an introvert.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:09.840]   I do well alone. I gain energy from being alone. I often find myself emotionally depleted when I'm
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:15.680]   with a lot of people, although I try to do it, but I like to be alone. So, I understand to some
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.360]   degree why people like to be alone, and I understand that there are some people who have
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.520]   that personality, that personality where they're happy with themselves and they're happy with
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:31.520]   being by themselves. But when you think about the end of someone's life, being a loner has
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:38.960]   consequences. My friend, for example, never married. I'd asked him about it at different
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:45.280]   times in his life. He didn't really ever open up all that much. I got the idea that he had
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.320]   experienced some heartbreak and some hurt early in his life, but he never really shared much about
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:57.120]   it and he just wasn't particularly interested in marriage. And I've known a number of men like this,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.640]   right? They're just not particularly interested in marriage. And of course, it's not required
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.280]   that anybody marry. I think it's fine. You're not morally superior if you marry or morally superior
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:18.000]   if you don't. But by choosing to be alone, choosing to not invest into the work of being
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.320]   married with someone, choosing to not invest into having children, those things are difficult. They
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:33.200]   lead to a certain life down the road. There have been many times facing the many responsibilities
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.960]   that I face where I look at somebody who's unmarried and I think, "Man, how great it would
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.200]   be just to be free, footloose and fancy free, not have to care for all these people, not have to
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:47.520]   arrange all these details, just be able to come and go as I like." So, it's not like there's one
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.400]   perfect answer. But you look at the end of a man's life and that decision to not marry, to not have
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:25:02.880]   children, that decision brings with it a certain set of consequences. And what I have observed is
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:11.360]   that by being a loner, he never had the opportunity to build confidence, he never had the responsibility
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.520]   to care for others, and he could let himself off the hook at every stage along the path.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.360]   There's something I've wrestled with for years in my own mind, trying to understand if there's a
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:30.400]   causal relationship or a correlation. The data indicates generally that married men make more
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:37.520]   money and have more wealth than unmarried men. Generally also, the data indicates that married
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:44.240]   men live longer than unmarried men and that they enjoy higher levels of health. Years ago, I read
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.560]   a book called Healthy at 100, and one of the points that that book made when talking about
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:26:00.640]   the factors that contribute to long-livedness is that a married smoker has a longer life expectancy
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.960]   than an unmarried non-smoker, statistically. And so, I've often wondered why, why? I've thought
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:14.160]   a lot about the wealth. Why is it, right? Is a married man sometimes wealthier because maybe he
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   has a dual-income household and he has his wife's income and they have lower expenses? Or is it
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.600]   just an accident, right? I don't think that you need to be married to get wealthy. I would never
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.880]   tell someone, "Oh, you're broke. Go get married." No, like, silly. I know lots of single people
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.800]   out to have lots of money, right? So, it's not like there's just an automatic direct relationship.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:42.080]   But I often have looked at my own life and I've thought about the things that I do,
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:51.600]   and I observe that in many things, I am motivated by my responsibilities, my obligations towards my
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:57.280]   family, but also my aspirations, my goals, the things that I want to provide for my family.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.120]   But I observe more than that, right? It's not just a matter of, "Okay, I have certain obligations or
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.320]   certain aspirations." It goes deeper than that. I see it as even a confidence booster.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:16.480]   I have watched carefully. I have been married now for 11 years. No, nine years. Nine years. I've
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:24.320]   been married for nine years. And as I observe my life and I watch the trajectory of friends of mine,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:31.920]   even my own age, who have not married, I observe every year kind of a widening of the gap in terms
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:39.200]   of my own personal levels of responsibility, my personal levels of confidence, my personal levels
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:49.360]   of self-discipline, etc. And I probably don't even want to talk about all of those things publicly,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.200]   but it just seems obvious to me that I have personally benefited by being charged with the
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:03.040]   responsibility to lead a wife and children. And that has changed me. It has transformed my
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:10.560]   character. Parents will often reflect on this, right, when you have a child. It can transform
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:18.640]   your character. You just don't have the choice any longer to lie in bed lazily when your little
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.560]   baby is calling out for you. You just do what you need to do. And there comes a cost with that,
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:30.720]   certainly, and it seems oftentimes like, "Oh, it'd just be so much easier," right? "It'd just be so
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.800]   much easier if we could just hang out and stay in bed all Saturday morning. It'd just be so much
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:43.920]   easier." But yet, these things transform us in a profound way. I'm convinced. So, I can't prove
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:49.680]   any of this. All I'm doing is reflecting on my experience. And I observe in my friend's experience,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:58.480]   who never married and never had children, that he never was obligated to come out of himself.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:06.800]   He always could let himself off the hook. He could always face a challenge and say, "Well,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.680]   that's okay. I don't need to follow through." And there was nobody there expecting more of him.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.680]   There wasn't a wife there believing in him. And so, he could just take the easy road,
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   take the low-pain road. Being a loner, I don't see did any good for him. I would never,
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.120]   to be clear, I would never have encouraged him to marry badly.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:37.120]   But when I've watched his life of having never married, it just seems profoundly sad.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:47.280]   His name will die with him. His legacy ends with him. To me, that seems sad.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   Now, what else could he have done? Well, one of the other big observations that I have is that he
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:02.240]   never engaged proactively with others. So, to repeat, because it's important, while I believe
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.520]   that marriage and children can be a transformative influence in our lives, I don't believe that they
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:16.400]   are a vital experience. I believe that there are many single men and women who live very meaningful
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.840]   lives, who will leave a legacy whose names will not die with them. And I don't believe that they
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.920]   should just go get married because somehow that's the only thing you need to do to be complete in
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.840]   life. I don't believe that. But what my friend also did not… I just believe that there's a natural…
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.040]   there's kind of a natural normalcy to that pattern. That's the normal pattern that does
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.240]   certain things for us as humans. But if we don't have that pattern, what can we do? Well, we can
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:48.880]   proactively serve others. We can proactively engage with others. And this is what my friend never did.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.280]   Now, was it a personality quirk? I don't know, but he lost because he didn't do it.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:01.520]   Let me contrast his death with the death of another friend of mine about a month or so ago.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:09.120]   My other friend was also a similar age, I guess. I think my other friend who died a month ago
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.320]   was a little younger. He was in his early 60s. My other friend did have a lot of children,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.480]   but my other friend had also been very active in the local community. He had established
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.880]   basically a youth group in his home, and his children were involved, and they would invite
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.240]   all the children in the local community over, and they would do all kinds of things. He was always
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.200]   going out and working to help others. He was very proactive, kind of a very intense mission focus.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:44.080]   And the feeling at the death of my friend who was proactive was very different than the death
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:50.320]   of my friend this morning. The death of my friend this morning feels tragic to me because it feels
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:57.440]   like a life wasted, whereas the death of my friend a month ago felt tragic because it was a life
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:03.200]   cut short, and you felt like this man had so much more to give. There was a massive difference in
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:08.080]   the number of people that their lives impacted. And when I reflect on my friend and the opportunities
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:15.760]   that he had, I think about how much he could have done if he had just simply tried, if he had just
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:23.040]   simply engaged with others, if he had sought out others and sought to help them. He never would do
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.480]   that. He would come over to your house if you invited him, and he would come, you know, he was
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.360]   happy to come over and eat. Wouldn't work much when you're there. If you asked him specifically
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.120]   for help, I would ask him for help on certain things. He would help sometimes, most of the time
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.480]   actually, he was fairly reliable, to help you move or something like that. But he wouldn't ever take
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.040]   that second step. He wouldn't ever initiate something, never invited you over to his house,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:53.200]   never invited you to an event, never invited you to dinner, never said, "Hey," you know,
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.960]   to a young person, "Would you like to go fishing?" or "Maybe I can go and teach you a certain thing."
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.160]   Just stayed by himself. And so, what happened is, because he never engaged with others proactively,
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:08.000]   he never built that social community around himself. He never did the work to sew into
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.280]   other people's lives and to serve other people that would create the kind of rich, warm, social
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:22.240]   fabric that he could have enjoyed. So, he stayed the loner, always the loner. But not the happy
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:30.960]   loner, not the adventurous loner, just the loner, the loser loner by himself, watching Netflix,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.000]   watching YouTube, waiting to die. What an awful thing to say.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.120]   But it's true. And I personally believe in the value of the truth. I think you shouldn't tell
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.800]   lies even at someone's funeral. More lies are probably told than almost any other forum in the
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:34:00.240]   world. Don't be a loner. Now, let me expand on this loner theme for a moment. What you could see
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:07.520]   over the years was that the more detached he became from people, the less and less confident
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:14.800]   he became, and the more of a loner he wanted to be. The one thing that kept him attached to people
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:25.360]   and kept him connected was, used to be his work. Was his work. I guess I should say work and church.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:33.680]   So, with his work, when he lost his last job, that cut that off. And then later he disengaged
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:39.520]   for a variety of reasons from church. And you could just see from an outside perspective that
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.440]   he was suffering. And no matter what you did to try to reach out to him, no matter how you
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   tried to engage him, you'd just suffer more, suffer more, because he had no contact with people,
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.080]   had no accountability, had no friendships, had nothing. And so the confidence just fell and fell.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.480]   And so, whereas at 62, before he took Social Security, he could still probably have gone out
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.960]   and gotten, he was, again, a smart guy, could have gotten any basic job. And yet at 64, he had
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.120]   been out of it so far, he couldn't even imagine the idea probably of going and applying for a job.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.680]   "Oh, I'm just not interested in anything." He would hide it under all these things,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.920]   but not interested in anything. And that lack of engagement,
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:24.640]   it killed him. Killed him. It was only a matter of time. He's already dead,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.320]   right? Off by himself, doing nothing. It's just a matter of, okay, what's actually going to take
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:37.040]   out his life? In this case, COVID. Okay. But the spark was already gone. It didn't have to be that
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:48.400]   way. It didn't have to be that way. He could have at any point in time tried. There were so many
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:54.560]   people around him who were conscious of his struggles, who were full with empathy, filled
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.480]   with empathy, right? Understanding. I'm not an unempathetic person. I understand when people
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.800]   have trouble. I understand that things are easier for some people. I know that there are things that
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.640]   are easier for me than other people. I would never go into someone's life and say, "Well,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   you just have to be like Joshua or anybody else." But he never even tried. And that's what makes
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:23.200]   you feel like, "What a waste. You never even tried." You were surrounded, surrounded by
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.400]   resources, surrounded by people, surrounded by a network of people, of friends, of people who
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:36.640]   would engage, and you never tried. Friend, if you find yourself pulling back into isolation,
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   don't. Stop. I mean, don't do that. Stop it. You have to press forward and maintain your engagement
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:52.880]   with people. Your community is one of the most valuable assets that you can build. And so, if
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:37:02.400]   you find yourself struggling and alone, it's not good for man to be alone. You have to reach out.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.960]   You have to be proactive. You have to try and make a friend, build a relationship.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:18.720]   You have to try. If you're married, great. That doesn't automatically solve anything.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:24.880]   If you're not married, invest yourself into other people. And I often think of people in my life who
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:30.480]   have made a difference for me. I have had many middle-aged single men who have invested into me
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   and who have helped me. It wasn't the family that magically changed it. It was their
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.680]   mindset, their worldview, their way of thinking about things. And so many men have impacted my
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:54.480]   life. And they sought to sow into me as a child. They sought to set up sports. They sought to
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.320]   hire me for work. They sought to take me fishing. They sought to encourage me, to engage with me.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:07.440]   And those men, when they die, I can say something very different at their funeral.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.320]   I can honor them for reaching out to me. I can honor them for doing things for me that I couldn't
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:21.440]   do, right? For paying for things for me that I couldn't pay for. One friend of mine was so
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:27.200]   faithful. All through my college years, he would continually... We would hang out. We would go to
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.640]   dinner. We were involved in some community things. We'd go to dinner. I didn't have the money to pay
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.360]   for it. He would cover my expenses. He would let me... He would take me... We would go on trips
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:40.240]   and whatnot together. And we had a great time. He was a mentor to me and a very meaningful part of
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   my life. And I can say something very different about him than my other friend who just was
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:54.160]   a lump on a log, didn't ever try. Don't be the person who doesn't try.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.200]   Now, how does this follow through? Well, a next thing that just struck to me is my friend did not
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:10.640]   ever grow. He never grew. When I reflect upon 35 years of knowing him, he was always the same.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:17.280]   He never grew. I saw him decline, with what I'm telling you about when he retired. I saw him
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.800]   decline, but he didn't grow. He didn't have a growth mindset. He didn't have something that
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:29.840]   was challenging him. I would casually, in a friendly way, I would always try to engage him.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.160]   Like, is there a hobby? Is there an interest? I was... For years, is there something that you're
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.360]   interested in? Oh, you could do such and such, right? You're interested in such and such.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.880]   Have you thought about maybe taking a class at the local library? Oh, look, here's a class,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.760]   or here's something really interesting. Here's a way you could do that. Nothing. He would not grow.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:52.720]   He would not learn. He would just sit. And you could see that reflected in all areas of his life.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:59.520]   He never developed any kind of a passionate long-term career. That's another thing that
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   could have been completely transformative for him, is if he had simply chosen one thing and said,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.040]   "I want to master this one thing. I want to get good at this one thing." That work would have
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.840]   kept him alive, and not only just physically alive, it would have kept him alive in his spirit,
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.080]   if he had just kept working. I reflect on that many times. I thought, "Did I... Should I have
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:28.000]   pushed harder?" And it was so painful for me for years to watch him after he retired. And he
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.560]   stopped working and he lost that one connection to the world. If he had just had a job where he
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:40.320]   could do a good job and have the satisfaction of a day's work well done, that would have made all
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:46.480]   the difference in the world. But man, you feel horrible when you sit back day after day and day
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   and do nothing. You feel great if you work a long week's work and then you have a weekend off to
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:00.320]   engage and rest and rejuvenation. Going to the lake, going to the beach, sitting at home with
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.760]   a cold drink in your hand and reading a book, watching a movie, all of these things feel great
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:13.680]   after a week's diligent labor. But when every single day you do those things,
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:21.040]   none of them feel great. You feel like a slob. You feel like a worthless person, somebody who
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:27.120]   doesn't contribute to anybody. And it eats at you, it destroys you as it destroyed my friend.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.960]   If he had just simply gotten a job and engaged with a career and there were many things that
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.640]   he was suited for, many things he could have done very well, just never started,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   it would have transformed his life and it would have transformed his money.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:47.040]   It was exceedingly sad to watch him with the money because what happened is he grew
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:51.760]   dissatisfied with some of his personal living circumstances, but he was stuck.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:58.960]   Exactly as I told him it would happen was exactly what happened. Before he took a social security,
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:05.120]   I told him, "If you do this, you're going to be stuck. It's not going to be easier for you at 67
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.960]   to get a job than it is at 61. It's just not going to be easier. It's not going to be easier to go
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.800]   and get a job later after you've been unemployed for four years than it is now." And he said,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.360]   "Oh, no, I'm going to do it. It's okay. I can go get a job in the future." Well, year passed on to
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:25.520]   year, year after year, year after year, same thing. And it's one of those things where I,
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:31.520]   on the one hand, you look at welfare programs, you look at things like social security. In this case,
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:38.240]   my friend, he was a veteran and so he died in a veterans hospital. And on the one hand, you feel
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.360]   like you say, "You know what? That's nice that at least he had some income. That's nice that at
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.880]   least he had some retirement income. So when he needed it, then he had it." Right? There is that
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:55.760]   sense. Then the other side of me looks at it and I get really frustrated and angry about the fact
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.560]   that he had a social security income there to live on. Why? Because the social security killed him.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.400]   I know, again, I'm not being hyperbolic. He sat down and did nothing.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.640]   He sat down and did nothing. And he never should have been put in a place where he could do that.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.120]   Life is designed where you have to do that. And this is where you look at a program that's
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.680]   ostensibly a program of caring, right? Here's somebody who's not disciplined enough to save
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.760]   for themselves. They're not disciplined enough to provide for their own future. So we, the government,
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.120]   are going to come in and we're going to mandate that he and his employer contribute from his
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.280]   wages into this program that's going to provide him with a pension. It's going to alleviate poverty.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.880]   Maybe it did, right? But I'm convinced my friend would be alive today if he had still been working.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.640]   I'm convinced that he would have been far happier if he had still been working. I'm
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.240]   convinced he wouldn't have wasted so many years if he had still been working.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:58.320]   Work is good for a man. I even came to the point, this is sad, but it's true. I told you I lived
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:05.680]   next door to him for a long time. I would frequently invite him over to dinner, frequently spend time
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.160]   with him, frequently talk to him. Eventually I came to the point where I couldn't do it in faith
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:16.720]   anymore. The Bible says, "Those who will not work, neither shall they eat." And I came to the point
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:22.960]   where I was convinced that he will not work. And he was being allowed out of the place of pain that
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.160]   God designed by the social security system. And I came to the point where I could no longer feed him
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.880]   because I thought, "I can't, this is not honoring to God. I can't feed a man who will not work.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.920]   I can't invite him over for dinner." I would still try to talk to him and engage with him when I
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:43.040]   could, but I couldn't invite him over to my house anymore. I could just see more than I've ever seen
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:51.120]   with anybody else the destruction in a man's life when he will not work and when the circumstances
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:58.560]   around enable his not working, enable his laziness. And I watched it destroy his life
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:07.440]   over the course of those years. When you look at these programs, you look at some of the stuff,
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:15.600]   you look at social security, you look at welfare programs, you see the destruction in human lives.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:21.520]   You watch the way it destroys character and it's so sad. Now, I don't believe the same thing occurs
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.720]   if you accumulate capital yourself. Why? Well, if you're accumulating capital yourself,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.760]   if you're denying your current desires intentionally so that you can save and
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:37.520]   accumulate more, you're building a strength of character that I think sees people,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:45.120]   many people successfully through those retirement years. You see people, but in my time,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:52.240]   I've never engaged with somebody who saved a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars or
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.760]   millions of dollars, and never coached them, consulted with them, and found them ever to lack
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:04.320]   character or to lack even vision of what they wanted to do when they retired. I still warn them,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.560]   but generally people say, "Oh, I'm retiring so I can do such and such, so I can be involved in this
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.040]   thing. And I'm not going to go to my job anymore, but I have these other 18 things that I've just
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.120]   been waiting for more time to do. I'm going to have more time and I'm going to do them." And
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.320]   they continue to be productive people. I do not believe that a man has to work for wages
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.640]   in order to eat. He just needs to work, right? And that work can be many different things. There's
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:33.440]   no prohibition on certain kinds of activities. But when a man accumulates his own money through
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.800]   thrift, through diligence, through denying his own current desires to accumulate for the future,
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:46.000]   it transforms his character. And I'm not necessarily saying that social security is
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.960]   morally wrong. It's run in a criminal way. It's a giant Ponzi scheme. But I'm not saying it's
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:58.640]   morally wrong. I'm saying that it doesn't have good results. If my friend had also saved and
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.920]   invested and had that character transformation, then the social security check would have been
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:08.080]   nice for him. But he didn't do it. Couldn't do it. And back to what I said about sowing the lives
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.240]   of others. One of the things that always limited him was his money. How could he say to, you know,
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.280]   the teenagers, "Hey, guys, let's go and do a rafting trip or let's go do a camping trip or
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:23.040]   something," because he didn't have any money, because he was living on the dole. It's just
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:35.200]   a total disaster on all sides. A total disaster. And finally, when someone gets in that situation,
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.080]   what do they have to look forward to? When you have somebody that's not growth-oriented,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:46.960]   that's not engaging with a career, with a future, when they're not looking forward and saying,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.040]   "In the future, I'm going to do such and such," when they're not being forced in the present to
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.560]   work towards something that they want, what do they have to look forward to? More Netflix? More
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.760]   YouTube? More Sunday afternoon shopping trips to the same grocery store you've been going to for
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:09.040]   15 years? More sitting in your house doing nothing by yourself? What a catastrophe.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:18.240]   Is it any wonder why you're dead soon? Is it any wonder why retirement kills you?
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:23.600]   That kind of disengaging and decoupling from life, decoupling from growth is deadly.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:31.840]   It's deadly. I don't fully understand how it kills you. I can't sit here and give all the
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.160]   medical things, but we've heard so many stories about people just lose their will to live.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.520]   Spouse dies, someone they've been married to for 70 years, and they just say, "That's it. I'm going
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.320]   to die. I've seen it with my grandparents who've died." They lose their will to live, and then the
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:52.400]   diseases come on. And so, maybe it's a disease like COVID. I don't know how my friend got COVID,
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:49:01.600]   barely left his house. Who knows? He got COVID. But who knows what the actual cause of death is?
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.080]   It's listed on the death certificate, but it's that disengagement from life. It's that retirement
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.600]   that disengages you from life. So, what's the answer? What are the alternatives?
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.880]   Here are some things that I think are important to contrast that with.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:24.880]   More than anything else, I am convinced that the secret to aging well is to always make your future
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:31.280]   bigger than your past. No matter the stage of life you are, no matter where you are,
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:38.960]   you always need to make your future bigger than your past. If your future is bigger than your
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   past, then there's hope in the future. And if there's hope in the future, there's power in
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:51.280]   the present. There's something that can keep you pressing forward. When somebody gives up hope,
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.960]   when somebody gives up a vision in the future that's bigger, something that's pulling them
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:02.080]   forward, they die. They die now. To me, that's the first and most important lesson. Always make
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:08.320]   your future bigger than your past. Then you'll grow successfully. Now, how do you make your
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:13.040]   future bigger than your past? Well, there are some areas that are fairly obvious, right? When you see
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:18.400]   people that are involved socially with other people, but usually the wife and children,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.120]   right? You say, "I want to see my grandchildren. I want to see my great-grandchildren. I want to
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.440]   play with them. I want to enjoy those relationships." And that can influence many people to
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:31.200]   make changes in the present that will see them to that goal. And there's a natural ebb and flow to
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.000]   life in these normal family relationships where you see, they bring you a focus, they bring you a
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.360]   joy, they bring you a clarity of goal. And so they're very impactful. You can see it in your
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.960]   community. When people are laboring for something, could be the group of students that they mentor at
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:55.040]   the local Boys and Girls Club, or the Boy Scout troop that they volunteer with, or the church
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.160]   organization that they spend time in, or whatever it is. And there's something there, and you have
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.520]   a change you're trying to see in the world. One of the most important things you can have is to
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:09.360]   develop a quest, something that you want to impact. Generally, I think a good place to start
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.640]   is to go look around the world and find some wrong that you want to right that's at the scale where
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.440]   you can actually have an impact and start laboring at it. And then if you fix that thing, then pick a
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.160]   bigger thing. So you always have some more thing that you're looking for, some more thing that
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:32.880]   you're seeking to change and to adjust, to improve. It can be financial goals. It can be a career,
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:38.800]   right? You're wanting to advance a certain thing. You're wanting to improve a certain thing. You
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.760]   always have to find a way to adjust what you're doing and not look back upon your glory days,
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:50.240]   but look forward to your future glory days. And if your imagination is failing you, then you've
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:55.600]   got to feed your imagination until you can look forward and build another quest in the future
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:00.560]   that's going to bring you forward. It has to be something you care about. My quest is not yours,
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.600]   but it has to be something that brings you forward, that you care about.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:15.200]   That's lesson one. Always make your future bigger than your past. The day at which your future
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.920]   is dimmer and smaller than your past is the day that death sets in for you.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:28.480]   It might take a little while for your heart to stop, but that's the day that you start dying.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:35.440]   Don't let that happen to you. Always make your future bigger than your past. Find something
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:41.040]   that you're working at. And life is full of so many inspirational people, so many people who've
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:47.760]   gone before us, who have charted the path and proven how it can be done, why it can be done.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:55.120]   Take your inspiration from anywhere. I always think about a guy like Stephen Hawking, right?
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:01.200]   Here's this guy who suffered this incredibly debilitating illness, and yet there he is,
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.920]   still seeking to use his mind, to use his intellect, to build something, to make a
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:11.200]   difference, to develop a theory, to adjust something, and seek to leave his mark upon the world.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:18.080]   No matter if you're wheelchair-bound, no matter whether you're paralyzed,
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:28.480]   you can find fulfillment and purpose in something. That something doesn't have to
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:34.080]   integrate with other people. It may just be you. Maybe you're painting. I think of someone like
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:39.520]   Johnny Erickson-Todd, right? Paralyzed young girl, but became this beautifully talented painter,
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:44.000]   and very inspirational, spoken to and encouraged, you know, millions of people with her testimony.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.160]   But maybe you just stay at home and you say, "What I'm doing is I'm becoming a better painter."
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:55.920]   You need to see that you're improving in something. You need to be trying with something.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.920]   Something that you're scared of, something that you could fail at.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:08.240]   Playing piano, caring for the neighborhood children, feeding and visiting the widows and
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:15.520]   orphans around you, ministering to the homeless. Find something. I tried so many times, my friend
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.760]   who died, I tried so many times to get him involved with somebody, to find an organization.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:24.240]   Because one of the most important things that you can do when you are depressed
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:30.480]   and when you're struggling is go and find someone to help. Go and find someone to serve.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:38.560]   You'll quickly start to diminish your own problems. I have a friend of mine right now
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:44.720]   who's isolated from COVID, can't go anywhere, everything's locked down, and I'm begging her,
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:52.320]   please, you have to go and find a place to go out and get involved in the community. You have to
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:59.360]   find a place to serve. You have to find a ministry, a relief organization, someplace where you can go
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:06.800]   and help people who are less fortunate. Because the risk of dying of coronavirus is far, far lower
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:15.280]   than the risk of dying from loneliness and solitude and self-pity. Hear me clearly, my friend who died
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:24.160]   this morning did not die of coronavirus. Without question, without question, he had coronavirus.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.880]   Without question, coronavirus caused the physical symptoms that took his life.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.480]   He didn't die from coronavirus though. He died years ago. It was just a matter of time and a
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.720]   matter of what's going to take him. It wasn't coronavirus that killed him. It was his decisions
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:47.840]   in life that killed him. Just took a few years for the death to actually occur. Make your future
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:56.800]   bigger than your past. Engage with others. Social contact is the key. Serve others. Serve others.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.840]   What did Jesus say when being asked about the greatest law by the Pharisees? He said,
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:07.200]   "Love God, love neighbor." You don't need anything more than that. Love God, love neighbor.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.720]   Usually, the way that we know that you love God is by how you love neighbor.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:23.520]   All right, so what James said, "I'll show you my faith by my actions." How do you know? What did
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:29.680]   John say? How do you know your love for God? By your love for one another. Love God, love neighbor.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.960]   If you're going to love God, you're going to have to love your neighbor. You're going to have to
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:41.680]   find someone and serve them and engage with them and help them and stay engaged with them. Keep
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:49.440]   that social contact. Press forward. Strive forward. Last thing I would say, specifically about money,
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:53.120]   I have other lessons as well, but I need to wrap this up. Specifically about money.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:58.800]   I don't think you should get into a point where your income is constrained.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:04.080]   One of the things that was so, I think, really bad in watching my friend's story was he was so
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.800]   constrained by his lack of money. He didn't have any money. Why didn't he have any money? Because
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.840]   he made certain choices that put him onto a fixed income. He didn't have any money.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:19.040]   Now, could he have still given? One of the things that the Bible says is that, "Why do you work?"
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:23.760]   Says, "Let each of you labor, working with his hand so that he may have something to give."
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.160]   If you don't have enough surplus in your budget to give to others, you need to work more.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:33.200]   If you don't have enough surplus in your budget to give to others, you need to work more.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:40.880]   Now, you can do that with a very, very small amount of money. We can all see a person's heart
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.920]   when there's someone that's generous, that's giving to others, even if the dollars are
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:50.240]   small. We rightly honor people. We don't honor one man who carelessly gives a million dollars
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:54.720]   that means nothing more than we honor someone who gives $100 that means everything to them.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:00.080]   We honor the one for whom it's the hardest impact. But when you find yourself saying,
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.280]   "Oh, I can't give to others. I can't labor in others. I can't sow into other people's
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.520]   lives because I don't have." Well, go and get something so that you can do it.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:15.920]   Again, just imagine the psychology of living on a fixed income,
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:23.200]   a very small income where you're physically trapped. You can't move. You can't go and move
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.440]   into a different apartment because, "Well, where am I going to cope with the first,
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.320]   last and security deposit?" You can't go and do the other thing. You can't move.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.320]   Don't allow yourself to be in that situation. There's always a way to do it.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:39.280]   There's always something more you can do. I tried, my friend, I tried him so many times. I said,
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.360]   "Why don't you drive for Uber? You're a good driver. You like to drive. Can you drive for
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.680]   Uber? You have a car. Do this." No, it's not going to do it.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:58.160]   I hope that these lessons are things that you can use. I know it's outside of the normal ebb and
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:06.960]   flow of financial planning, but man, it's so meaningful. I find it so painful to say some of
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.960]   the things, the harsh, hard truths that I have said about my friend's life.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:21.760]   You don't want to say uncharitable things about people that you love, people that you care about.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:29.680]   It just feels like such a waste. And that is not a good feeling
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.840]   for your friends and your family to have at your funeral.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:39.760]   If you are somebody who is wasting your life, I beg of you, stop.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:50.960]   Stop. You may or may not believe that God exists. That's okay. It's an important question,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:58.320]   but I understand different perspectives. But what we can all agree on is that your life,
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.640]   I hope we can all agree on, your life matters. You want your life to matter.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:10.000]   And so, whether you believe that the work that you do in this life prepares you for the next life,
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.280]   as I do, or whether you believe that the work that you do in this life is all there is,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:21.760]   I just simply beg you to observe and to notice that the way that you live this life
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:28.720]   has an impact. It has an impact on you. You can be entirely successful,
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:38.000]   or you can sit back and wait to die. Don't do that.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.880]   I don't know how I could possibly encourage you more strongly with that.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:50.080]   Just make your life matter. If you've never reflected on your death, think about it.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.760]   Do you want some random guy on the internet saying hard things about you at your death?
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.040]   It's not going to be me, of course, but somebody else. Your friends are watching,
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.800]   and they're learning. Make sure that your life is a life they can learn from,
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:12.000]   on the positive side, not learn from as a negative example. If you'll live a life
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:21.120]   of labor, of work, if you'll love others, if you'll engage with life, if you'll not be passive,
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.840]   if you'll press forward within the context of your personality, you don't have to ignore your
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.280]   personality, but if you'll press forward and engage with life and engage with things that
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.880]   matter to you, then when you die, your friends can rejoice over the meaning of your life.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.520]   Doesn't matter whether you die at 30, at 60, or at 100. They can rejoice over that.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.160]   My other friend that I'm foiling with, two people, died of coronavirus, similar ages,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.600]   neither one of them had any apparent health conditions, but they both died. When I went
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:00.240]   to my other friend's funeral, I was sad to lose him, but I wasn't sad for the meaning of his life.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:08.080]   He left a rich legacy, a rich, rich legacy, even though he only had 60-ish years to do it in.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.040]   You may only have 20 years to do it in. But brother, get busy
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:23.600]   sowing a legacy. That legacy is going to involve work. I hate retirement.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:32.720]   I hate retirement because I believe that retirement, if by retirement we mean withdrawing,
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.160]   I believe retirement kills people and makes them unhappy.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.640]   So, think very carefully before you retire.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:50.080]   To me, I have for years watched my friend systematically decline since he retired. I
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.880]   knew what I said to him, I knew at the time what I thought would happen, and watching it happen
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.200]   exactly as I thought it did has been even more sobering for me than you can imagine.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.120]   Don't retire. If you want to stop working for labor, for wages I mean,
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.240]   stop working for wages because you have something else that you're going to do, great.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:17.440]   But, that sounds so corny, re-fire, right? Find something that you're going to work at,
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.200]   something that's going to keep you on that growth mindset. Make sure that your future
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.480]   is always bigger than your past. Don't isolate yourself. Don't pull back from people.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:33.680]   Pour out your life loving others. And then, when people hear of your death,
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:41.040]   they'll be sad for their loss, but they'll be satisfied for a life well lived,
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.200]   and hopefully be rejoicing that you received the reward for your life well lived.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:51.360]   Because it's a painful, painful thing for your friends to hear that you've died,
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.520]   and for them to first think, "Well, what a waste."
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:02.240]   I don't want to end with that sense, I just say that I appreciate many things about my friend.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:09.600]   He was a kind man. He was a kind man. I don't know what else to say. He wasn't a mean man.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.000]   But when you see someone's potential, and you see what they could have done,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.400]   and what could have happened, and how they could have grown, and you see that they didn't do it,
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:24.960]   for whatever reason, to me it's sad. And I don't want that to be the case for me, or for you.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.720]   I want to live full out. I want to live…I may have many flaws.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.920]   We've all known many people with many flaws. We all have many flaws.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.840]   Having flaws is not…to have flaws is to be human.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:51.200]   None of us are perfect, nor will we ever behave perfectly. But there's a sense of passion that
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.480]   you appreciate about certain people. That passion does not have to be on a grand scale.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:04.880]   Your passion does not have to be mine. But when probed, somebody should find that sense of
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:12.400]   passion in you. So, if you're not currently experiencing it, it's okay. Right? It's okay.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:17.040]   But don't make decisions that are going to continue to disengage you with others.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.440]   Don't make decisions that are going to isolate you. Don't make decisions that are going to cause
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:29.760]   you to be able to indulge your laziness. Don't make those decisions. It leads down a wrong path.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.520]   I hope that a useful message has come through this show.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:41.120]   Don't know what to do other than just to honestly share how I feel, and hope that as I reflect on
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.800]   for myself, I don't want the legacy of my life to be anything like the legacy of my friend.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.880]   And I don't want it for you either. God bless you. Have a great day.
