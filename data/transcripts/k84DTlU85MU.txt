[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.080]   the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the tenth chapter and the twentieth verse.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.640]   The twentieth verse in the tenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.840]   Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.920]   rejoice because your names are written in heaven.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.400]   Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.800]   rather because your names are written in heaven.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.440]   There can be no doubt that this is one of the most important incidents in the life and
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.080]   training of the disciples of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.200]   Here they were sent out by him for the very first time to exercise their ministry.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.680]   He gave them power to preach and to cast out devils.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.360]   And they went out, you remember, and we are told here that the seventy returned again
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.400]   with joy saying, "Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.240]   They came back full of elation, full of a spirit of satisfaction and of joy in the light
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.700]   of the things that they had thus been unable to do.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.800]   Never did a body of men seem to be so happy, and never, looking at it superficially, was
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.440]   there ever a body of men that had a greater right to rejoice and to feel this sense of
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.840]   satisfaction.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.520]   But you remember, our Lord at once detects something very dangerous in their condition,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.840]   and he proceeds to speak to them in a most solemn manner and issues to them what really
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.440]   can be described as a very stern warning.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.000]   Finally he said to them, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.560]   Now that is a difficult statement in many ways, and is open to a number of different
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   interpretations.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.840]   There are those who would not hesitate to say that what it really means is this, that
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.560]   as our Lord looked at these men and saw their elation and their joy and their rejoicing
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.000]   at the success of their mission, he looked at them and said, "I have seen somebody
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.920]   remarkably like you before.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:04.080]   I beheld Satan, that bright angelic spirit, that angel created by God and endowed with
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.520]   such remarkable powers.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:16.560]   I have seen him fall from his position of glory down to the very depths because of something
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.160]   very similar to this."
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.760]   Whether that is the right interpretation or not, one finally, of course, cannot prove,
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.560]   but it is at any rate open to that interpretation.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.080]   And as I want to try to show you, the remainder of our Lord's statement does seem to suggest
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.840]   that that is, after all, the right way of looking at that remarkable and extraordinary
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   statement.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:50.680]   Our Lord seems to use the case of Satan himself to point and to press this stern warning of
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:58.440]   his to his elated and rejoicing disciples.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.880]   Very well then, I say, this is clearly something that is of supreme importance.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.080]   And our Lord goes on to elaborate it.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.520]   "Behold," he says, "I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.800]   all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you, notwithstanding, in
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:29.120]   this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you, but rejoice because your names are
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   written in heaven."
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.040]   Now, this warning applies, obviously, not only to those first disciples, but to all
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040]   of us.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.640]   No doubt these gospels have been given to us in order that these lessons might be appropriated
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.120]   by us.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.080]   In the training of these disciples, we see a picture of the training of all Christians.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.480]   And what our Lord points out as being a danger, and a very great danger to these men, therefore,
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.840]   is equally a great danger for us.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.440]   And here, then, our Lord calls us to face what is, perhaps, after all, one of the greatest
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   dangers confronting us, likewise, in our Christian life and in our spiritual warfare.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   What is it?
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.840]   Well, we can put it in a phrase by putting it like this.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.280]   It is our fatal tendency to rejoice in the wrong things in connection with our spiritual
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.680]   life and experience.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.480]   Now, here, in the case of the disciples, it was the tendency to rejoice in that particular
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.520]   gift that he had given them, the gift of being able to control and to cast out and to master
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.120]   and exorcise these devils.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.080]   But that is only an illustration.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   It is equally applicable to the tendency to rejoice in any type of gift, anything that
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.480]   is given to us by the Lord in our Christian life.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.120]   Let me mention some of them that come to us, perhaps, most frequently.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   Experiences.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.320]   They are given to us by the Lord in his grace, exactly in the same way as he gave this power
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.480]   to cast out devils to the ascemptic.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:38.520]   And therefore, there is this tendency to rejoice in experiences, visions, things we have felt,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:46.720]   things we have seen and heard, remarkable happenings in our life and in our experience.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.640]   They are given to us from God and by God, and the danger is, I say, to rejoice in such
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.720]   things.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.520]   Or it can apply to many other gifts.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.900]   It may apply even to a man's natural ability.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.960]   And that natural ability is applied to the scriptures.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   A man may be given the gift of understanding the scriptures, the gift of teaching, the
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.280]   gift of expounding, the gift of preaching, the gift of reasoning, the gift of logic,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:28.040]   the ability to argue and to demonstrate the truth, a knowledge of truth and of doctrine.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.520]   All these things are gifts which are given to men by God.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.720]   So men can generate or create or produce for themselves such gifts in exactly the same
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.760]   way as the gift of casting out devils was given to the ascemptic.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.920]   God gives us these various gifts in connection with our Christian life and warfare.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:58.080]   And the danger is, I say, the danger of rejoicing in these particular gifts, in these abilities,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.760]   in these various things that have come to us and are a part and parcel of our whole
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   life and experience.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   Oh, and you can think of many others.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.400]   Success in our work, whether it be public work or whether it be private work, it doesn't
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   matter.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.480]   Anything that we may be doing for God and in connection with his kingdom, whatever the
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.000]   form it may take.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.600]   Now according to our Lord, this is something about which we have to be very wary.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.960]   He seems to be almost harsh, doesn't he, with these men.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   Here they come back.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.720]   The very first time, I say, they'd been sent out for the first time and back they
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.920]   come full of this rejoicing and this glorying in what had taken place.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.640]   And suddenly our Lord speaks these solemn words that almost seem to crush them.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.800]   It must, I say, be something, therefore, that is of the greatest importance.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.280]   And indeed, anyone who knows anything at all about himself or herself or about the spiritual
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:06.400]   life must have already experienced and have known what a terribly serious thing this is.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.480]   Certainly speaking for myself, I can say this without any hesitation, that I would say that
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   there is nothing that is productive of more problems which come to a pastor than just
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.980]   this very thing.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.880]   So constantly one has to deal with people who at one moment are elated, at the next
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.960]   moment terribly depressed.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.680]   Sometimes they come in and nothing as it were can possibly hold them down.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.320]   They're flowing over with joy and with rejoicing at what's happening.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.120]   You meet them the next time and they look haggard and drawn and unhappy.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.720]   They're down in the depths.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.140]   It's generally due to this very thing.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:56.360]   The unsteadiness in our Christian life and experience and in our Christian department
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.960]   can generally be traced back to our failure to realize this very thing which our Lord
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.160]   is here impressing upon the seminary.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.720]   Now the important thing for us is, if we can, to arrive at a principle.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.600]   What is the essence of this problem?
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.840]   Well, I would suggest that it's this.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:26.240]   It is our tendency, which we show all along the line, to be interested in manifestations
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.280]   rather than in principles.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:37.040]   If you like, it's our tendency to be interested in symptoms rather than diseases.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.720]   It's our tendency to be interested in fruit rather than in the life which produces the
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.560]   fruit.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.120]   It's our interest in the outward rather than the inward, the spectacular rather than
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.600]   the real and the solid.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.260]   Now here is something I say which really is a principle that is applicable all along the
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.040]   line in our Christian life.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:11.600]   Is not this the essential cause of our trouble in connection with the problem of sin?
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:20.480]   So many of us are deluded by Satan because we are interested in sins rather than in sin.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.240]   And because we are interested in sins rather than sin, the next step is we become interested
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.600]   in particular sins and ignore all the rest.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.760]   Now if we were to concentrate on the principle of sin and of evil rather than upon the occasional
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   manifestations, we should always be alive and alert.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.280]   We'd never know a feeling of self-satisfaction.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.920]   It is men and women who have thought of this whole problem in terms of particular sins
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.400]   only who tend to talk about perfection.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.080]   And we imagine that they have arrived and that they no longer sin, who have passed,
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.600]   as they say, from the seventh to the eighth of Romans and have no longer any troubles
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   in their lives.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.360]   That's because they've been interested in manifestations rather than in the principle.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:15.560]   So you see, it works there on that negative side in the whole problem of sin in our lives.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.280]   But the thing which we want to deal with more particularly this morning is that it is equally
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.980]   true on the other side and as regards salvation.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.040]   The essence of the trouble is that instead of being interested in the great salvation
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:41.480]   itself, we are interested in its occasional manifestations, in certain consequences, in
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.840]   certain results of salvation.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:51.480]   And because we tend to put those things before the great thing itself, I say we tend to land
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   in trouble.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.200]   Well, now then, our Lord deals with that great principle here.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.840]   And what he tells us is what he said to the Ascended, that we must not go on rejoicing
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.040]   in these particular things.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.600]   Now, let's be quite clear about this.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.680]   Our Lord does not say that it is wrong to rejoice in these particular things, because
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:25.640]   clearly a God-given gift is something in which a man ought to rejoice and should rejoice.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   Clearly what our Lord said is this.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.800]   However, let me give you an alternative translation.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:39.080]   However, he said to them, you must stop rejoicing over the fact that the spirits are submitting
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:48.160]   to you, but continue to rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.720]   Now by translating it like that, I think we bring out this point.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.360]   Our Lord does not condemn the mere fact of the rejoicing.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.880]   What he does condemn is their tendency to persist or to continue in rejoicing in that
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.600]   particular thing, because if they continue to rejoice in that, it becomes the chief and
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.280]   the main thing in their lives, and that is the thing that is wrong.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   You are not to go on rejoicing, he says, in the fact that the spirits are subject to you.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:27.120]   What you are to go on rejoicing in is the fact that your names are written in heaven.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:35.320]   And thereby, you see, he brings us face to face with the essence of the argument.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.120]   Let me divide it up for you like this.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.960]   Why are we not to go on rejoicing in these particular gifts?
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:52.040]   Why does our Lord say, nevertheless, notwithstanding, in this, do not continue to rejoice?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:59.760]   I commend you to stop rejoicing in that fact, in order that you may go on rejoicing in the
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   other.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.280]   Why does he tell them to stop rejoicing in this?
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:10.640]   Well, here it seems to me are some of the answers to that question.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:18.320]   Gifts, after all, are not a proof of the fact that we are truly Christian.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.400]   Now that may sound rather alarming, but I can justify it from the Scripture.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:32.120]   It is wrong to go on rejoicing in a particular gift, because I say the possession of a gift
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.840]   does not prove of necessity that we really are Christians.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.280]   Now here is the proof.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   Once these people were sent out by our Lord on this occasion, was Judas Iscariot.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.120]   Nowhere are we told in the Scripture that these gifts were not given to Judas.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.360]   The gifts were given to all the disciples without any distinction whatsoever.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.680]   And there is no doubt that Judas was able to exercise these gifts in exactly the same
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.680]   way as the other disciples.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.560]   There was no distinction.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.080]   Had it been the case that the other eleven possessed them and exercised them, and Judas
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.320]   alone did not, everybody would have been suspicious of him from the very beginning.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.400]   And yet you remember, when we come to the end of the story, not one of these disciples
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.600]   knew which it was of their number that was going to betray their Lord.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   There was apparently no difference between Judas and the others.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.680]   He had all the same gifts and he was able to exercise them.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:36.000]   So you see, it is possible for a man to have one of these gifts and still not be a Christian.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.560]   Now that is a principle that we find in the Old Testament, isn't it?
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.680]   The prophets teach us that it was the Lord who raised up Cyrus.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:54.560]   God has often raised up and has used a pagan power or a pagan person to exercise a certain
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.520]   ministry.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.040]   There is no reason why God should not, if he so chooses, give a particular gift to anybody.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.360]   But the fact that he has done so does not prove that such a person is truly a Christian.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.040]   If you want the final proof, you have it in the words of our Lord himself at the end of
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.840]   the Sermon on the Mount, where he deals, you remember, with this whole question of the
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.040]   false prophets.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.400]   He says that at that last day, the Day of Judgment, "Many will come to me and will say,
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:32.040]   'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:38.200]   this very thing, and in thy name done many wonderful works?'
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.880]   And yet I will say unto them, 'Depart from them.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.160]   I never knew you, ye workers of iniquity.'"
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.040]   Now there are people, you see, who will be able to say quite truly that they have cast
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.080]   out devils in the name of Christ, and yet they do not belong to him.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.320]   Well, isn't it obvious, therefore, that this is not something in which we should continue
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   to rejoice?
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.040]   Isn't it a very dangerous thing, therefore, to be looking at this and concentrating upon
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   this?
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.080]   This is the big thing, the thing in which we go on and persist in rejoicing.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.760]   It is obviously a highly dangerous thing for us to do.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.360]   It may be concealing from us the last condition of our souls.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.080]   It is very difficult to differentiate and to distinguish between natural and spiritual
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   gifts.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.600]   A man with a natural understanding can often understand the Scriptures up to a point.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.200]   He may be able to analyze it, but it does not mean that he has a spiritual understanding
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   of necessity.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:47.520]   A man may be able to preach with great eloquence, he may be interested in arguing about doctrine.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.400]   It does not prove of necessity that he is a Christian.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.000]   Very well, says our Lord, do not rejoice in this, do not persist, do not go on rejoicing
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   in that.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.400]   That is not the big thing.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:07.160]   Then another reason for not rejoicing in that, obviously, is the danger of pride and the
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.960]   danger of self and of self-conceit.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:16.200]   Ah, my friends, this is the greatest danger in the Christian life.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.440]   This is the most subtle danger of all.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.600]   This is the last enemy of the greatest saints.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.640]   You read their lives and you will find that they will always tell you that their greatest
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.680]   enemy was themselves.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.220]   When the world no longer could appeal to them and when the flesh seemed to be almost dormant
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.800]   if not dead, self was still there.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.160]   Self is the last enemy.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.200]   And of course there is nothing that so panders to self and so tends to puff up self as the
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.560]   possession of gifts.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.960]   The Bible again is eloquent about this matter.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.600]   The twelfth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians and the thirteenth chapter,
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.960]   that is their great theme.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.040]   It was the thing that was threatening to ruin the life of the church at Corinth.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.640]   And of all things that tend to pander to pride and to inflate us with pride and self-satisfaction
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:19.040]   and everything that ministers to self, the possession of gifts, the giving of experiences,
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.880]   these are the things that put us at the center all along.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.800]   It is something I have done or something that has happened to me.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:32.520]   And that is why these things are always so dangerous to the soul.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.720]   Now the apostle, I think, sums it all up very perfectly in a well-known word that he writes
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   to Timothy.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:44.080]   It is in the sixth verse of the third chapter of the first epistle to Timothy.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.560]   In talking about the appointment of bishops, this is what he says.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.560]   Not a novice.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.200]   You must not appoint a novice.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.600]   You must not appoint somebody who is only just being converted, says the apostle.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.560]   You must not take a raw recruit, as it were, a man who has only just entered into the Christian
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.560]   life.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.560]   Why?
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:10.080]   Well, here, "lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.400]   You see, which justifies that interpretation of this reference to Satan falling as lightning
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.160]   to which I referred just now.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.760]   Do not appoint a novice.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.360]   Do not put a man who is only just being converted into a position of leadership, says the apostle
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.120]   to this young man, Timothy, because if you do, there is the danger of his being lifted
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.600]   up with pride and it will happen to him as it happened to the devil who fell from his
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   position of glory down to hell.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.880]   Now I wonder whether we are all as alive to this danger as we should be.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.200]   The principle is that we are not to glory, not to rejoice, not to have as the central
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.800]   thing which leads to our happiness either something that has happened to us or something
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.120]   that we are given to do.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.240]   Don't go on rejoicing in deaths, says our Lord.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:08.560]   And then my last reason at this point would be this, that all these things, after all,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:14.880]   tend to be transient and therefore uncertain.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.440]   And therefore, as I've said, they tend to lead to a lack of balance and a lack of steadiness
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.920]   in the Christian life.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   Oh, I'm sure you'll all agree with me when I say that there is nothing which is quite
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.960]   so humbling and humiliating in one's Christian life and experience as to note the fluctuations.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.240]   Is there anything that is more grievous than that, when you look at yourself and examine
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.160]   yourself in the light of this word?
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.960]   When we realize what we ought to be, is there anything of which we are so ashamed as the
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:55.040]   fact that our lives fluctuate so much, up and down, happy and less happy, perhaps even
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.320]   miserable, certain and uncertain?
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:03.520]   Now all these fluctuations, as I'm suggesting, are probably to be traced ultimately to the
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.000]   fact that we are rejoicing in the wrong thing.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.760]   We are allowing our Christian life to be controlled and governed and determined by something which
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.720]   is not central.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:19.840]   We are taking hold of some incidental, something that is there occasionally but not permanently.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.680]   It's like a man who's only happy when he's looking at flowers, and if he hasn't got them
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.980]   in the winter, well then he's no comfort and no consolation whatsoever.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.200]   It's because we are interested in the things that come and go, rather than in the things
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.080]   that are permanent and eternal.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.880]   Don't rejoice in this, as our Lord.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.080]   You're unable to do this now.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.680]   A day may come when you're not.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.400]   I give the power, I can withhold the power.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.600]   Don't base your life on that, therefore.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:52.000]   Don't go on rejoicing in the fact that the devils are made subject to you.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.280]   Don't be over-related as you are.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:01.400]   Don't make this the beginning and the end of your experience.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.960]   And that then brings him to the positive.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:11.880]   You're to stop rejoicing in that, he says, but you are to go on rejoicing in this other
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.880]   thing.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   Well, what is that?
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   Well, here it is.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   In the fact that your names are written in heaven.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.400]   Now, this is one of the most remarkable and glorious things, I think, that we can ever
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.760]   consider.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.120]   And for myself, I feel that there is nothing so vital as just to realize what is, after
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.240]   all, to be central.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.440]   That's the value of a holiday, I sometimes think, that it gives you time to look at things
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   as a whole.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.360]   We are all in danger always of being immersed in details in our work.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.240]   It's almost inevitable to us.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.400]   And we tend to lose our sense of proportion.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.320]   The great reason for taking a holiday is that it gives you your sense of proportion back.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.840]   While you're in the midst of things, I say, you tend to get lost.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.200]   The value of a holiday is you go aside, you stand apart, and you look on at it all, and
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   you begin to see things as they are truly.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.600]   Well, now then, I says, "Ah, Lord, this is the thing.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.840]   The thing of all things in the Christian life is that your names are written in heaven.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   That's the thing to go on rejoicing in."
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.320]   Why?
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.920]   Well, we can answer the question quite simply.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.840]   First of all, it's the opposite of the three things that I've noticed already on the negative
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.120]   side.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:37.040]   If you like, this is an absolute proof of the fact that we are Christians.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.560]   You don't take much pride in this fact because you know that your name is written in heaven
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.440]   not because you've done anything or because you are what you are, but because of the grace
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.440]   of God.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.640]   It's a glorious thing, and it's the most humbling thing at the same time.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.400]   To realize that your name is written in heaven doesn't inflate anybody with pride.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.720]   It shouldn't do if he understands what it means.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's therefore something in which he can rejoice without any danger of pride, the thing that
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.560]   caused the fall of Satan to enter him.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.520]   And of course, the other thing is that it's permanent.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   It's transient.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.680]   If it's there, it's there, and will be there.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   However, let me break that up.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.880]   Let me put it in the form of a number of principles.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.560]   Why can we safely and legitimately rejoice in this fact, and why indeed does our Lord
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.040]   exhort us to do so?
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.280]   Because my friends, we are meant to rejoice in this.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.600]   Indeed, I like to think of this as being the essential definition of a Christian.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   What is a Christian?
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:46.800]   Well, a Christian is a man who rejoices in the fact that his name is written in heaven.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.320]   Why must I rejoice in this?
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.320]   Why should I?
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:58.600]   Well, first of all, it emphasizes what we are, and not what we do.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.440]   What an important point that is.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.560]   That's the key to the understanding of the whole of the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.520]   You rejoice in what you are, and in nothing else.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.720]   You see, the church at Corinth was split up.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.240]   I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.920]   What was the matter with them?
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.320]   They were rejoicing in men.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.440]   Why were they rejoicing in men?
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.040]   Because in their ignorance, because they were babes in Christ, they were not rejoicing in
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.140]   what they were.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.080]   If you put anything in the place of what you are as a Christian, you will eventually go
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.440]   astray.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.080]   They were rejoicing in particular spiritual gifts.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.280]   One had a great gift, another had a lesser gift.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.440]   The eye was despising the foot, and the hand, and so on, and vice versa.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.440]   What's it all due to?
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.520]   Well, it's due to the fact that they are not rejoicing in what they are, but in gifts
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.040]   that they have received and that they are able to exercise.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.640]   And so on, you go right through the whole epistle.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.800]   The strong brother and the weak brother, and all the rest of it.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.640]   It's entirely due to this.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:11.440]   So we can safely rejoice in this because it puts its emphasis on what we are.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.720]   And you see, by putting the emphasis on what we are, it puts the emphasis on grace.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.920]   Let me make this clear again.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.280]   I'm not trying to depreciate gifts.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.880]   We are not meant to depreciate gifts.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:31.520]   As Paul puts it to those Corinthians, "Seek rather," he says, "the best gifts.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.560]   Yet show I you a more excellent way."
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.880]   And what is the more excellent way?
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:42.080]   Well, the more excellent way is to walk from gifts to grace and to graces.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.760]   The more excellent way is to go out of the realm of things you do to this wonderful realm
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.080]   of what you are.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.280]   And then comes the hymn of love in the thirteenth chapter.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.320]   We are not depreciating gifts, but we are exalting grace.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:05.800]   Grace is altogether superior to gifts because grace eventually is love, and love is God
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.200]   himself, for God is love.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.920]   And therefore, to rejoice in the fact that we have received the grace of God and that
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.740]   the grace of God is in us, takes us right out of this realm of self, and we are rejoicing
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.560]   in God.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.560]   What we are, not what we do.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.500]   So it does not matter what a man is, what his gifts are, what he has been enabled by
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.520]   God to do, what results have followed his work.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:37.800]   Oh, I say it is nothing in comparison with the fact that he has received the grace of
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.300]   God.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.500]   But let us go on.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.340]   This is superior and this is something in which we ought to rejoice and to go on rejoicing
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:54.060]   because it emphasizes our relationship to God.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.060]   You see what it means.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.380]   It means this.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.900]   If I am rejoicing in the fact that my name is written in heaven, it means that I am rejoicing
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:08.860]   in the fact that God has ever looked upon me, that God has ever called me by his grace,
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:14.300]   that God himself has written my name in the book in heaven.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.580]   That is what it means.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.580]   I remember once reading about a man, a saint in Germany in the Middle Ages, I think it
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:29.540]   was, or a little later, who on his deathbed asked that when he did die and the funeral
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:35.220]   sermon was to be preached, that the text should be the text that we are considering together
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.220]   this morning.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.620]   He even went further.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.500]   He divided up the text.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.020]   He put down the headings on a piece of paper.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.500]   And I do not remember it all, but I do remember that the first heading which he got down was
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.500]   this.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.940]   "Who is the one who writes the name?"
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:56.380]   I happen to remember that the second was this, "The ink in which it is written."
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:00.420]   Ah, you see how right he was.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.420]   Rejoice in the fact that your names are written in heaven.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:09.580]   It means this, that I know that the Almighty God himself has written my name in the book
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.780]   of life.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.020]   It means I am rejoicing in my relationship to God.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.660]   Nothing that I am, nothing that I do, but in my relationship to him.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:30.180]   Oh yes, it means this also, that I am rejoicing in the fact that my sins have been forgiven.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.580]   It means that I am rejoicing in the fact that I know that the enmity that was between me
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.620]   and God has been removed and that I am reconciled to God.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.940]   Listen to this as John puts it in the book of Revelation in the twentieth chapter, verses
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.780]   11 and 12.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:52.580]   And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.780]   heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:03.500]   And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.780]   And another book was opened, which is the book of life.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.820]   And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.200]   to their works.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.940]   So it means that, therefore, doesn't it, that if I am rejoicing in the fact that my
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:26.500]   name is written in heaven, I am rejoicing in the fact that Christ has loved me and has
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.740]   died for me.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:34.020]   I am rejoicing in the fact that my name is inscribed in that roll in heaven, written
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   with what?
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.020]   With the blood of Christ.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.020]   That's the ink.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.020]   The blood of Christ himself.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.060]   Here's the thing to rejoice in, my friends.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.500]   Not in your experiences, not in something peculiar and special to you, not in something
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.060]   that you have that nobody else has, not in some extraordinary thing, but in the fact
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:58.140]   that the blood of Christ has been shed for you.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:03.380]   And that because of that your sins have been blotted out, and that your name is in the
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:09.340]   book of life that will be opened on the morning of the day of judgment.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.860]   But more, it means this.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:17.780]   It means that God has made us his children.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.820]   There's nothing greater than that.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.180]   And yet how infrequently do we remember this?
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.940]   Do you know the greatest thing that a man can say in this life and in this world is
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.580]   just this?
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.040]   My God.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.740]   The greatest thing a man can ever know is that God has said of him, "I will be their
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.340]   God and they shall be my people."
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.540]   There's nothing beyond that.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.340]   It's the highest privilege, the greatest honor.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.860]   Why is it, I wonder, that we don't think of these things more frequently?
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.900]   Why are we so interested in these experiences and in these gifts and in the things we do
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.580]   and in the things that come into our life and so on?
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.040]   Why is it that we are dependent as we are upon feelings and things of that kind?
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.560]   Why is it, my friends, that we are not spending the whole of our time rejoicing in the fact
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:14.760]   that we can say, "My God," and that we are God's children?
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.320]   Isn't that the trouble with us?
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.920]   You see, if you're a child of God, you're always a child of God.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.600]   You're not only a child of God when the sun is shining, you're a child of God when the
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.480]   clouds are there.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   You're not only a child of God when you're receiving gifts in such abundance that you
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.800]   scarce know how to contain them, but you're still a child of God when he doesn't seem
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.320]   to be giving you anything.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.480]   You're a child of God when things are running smoothly, but you're equally a child of God
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.040]   when bereavement and sorrow come.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.400]   It never changes, it never varies.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:57.320]   And oh, I say, the blindness which afflicts us, which allows us to look at anything save
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:04.320]   this fact that we are in this wonderful relationship to God.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:12.880]   For if my name, I say, is written in heaven, it has been written by the finger of God himself.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:20.720]   And it means, therefore, that he knows me, and that I am his child.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.240]   And that in turn leads to this.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.140]   It is a guarantee of his care for me.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:34.580]   If I am a child of God, well then, I know for certain that all the very hairs of my
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:40.200]   head are numbered and that nothing can happen to me apart from God.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.720]   That's why our Lord tells us to go on rejoicing in a thing like this.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.040]   You see, this is the guarantee.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:54.200]   My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.520]   Can you imagine anything greater than that?
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:03.140]   My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:08.120]   If you belong to him, says Paul to those Philippians, that's the promise that covers you.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.120]   Listen to him again.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:16.720]   He, he says, is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that he, having all sufficiency
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:23.680]   in all things, may abound to every good work.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.120]   Can you imagine anything more all-inclusive than that?
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:33.400]   All things, always, all sufficiency.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.000]   There is literally no limit to it.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.160]   Now you see, this is why our Lord tells us to rejoice in something like this.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.520]   If your name is written in heaven, well, you are in the hands of a God who can do things
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.080]   like that.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.600]   You are his child, and because you are his child, well then, he is guaranteed to supply
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.280]   you with every need that can ever arise in your life and in your experience.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.680]   And there is no limit to what he can do.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.240]   That's the thing to rejoice in.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   How trivial everything else becomes by the side of this.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.480]   The things that come and go, the things that are special to me, here is the fact.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.960]   I am a child of God and in his keeping.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.080]   Well, yet, let me go on.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.920]   It guarantees our perseverance also and our final security.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.480]   The Apostle Paul, having looked at every possible challenger, is able to say, having inspected
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:35.400]   them all, that he is persuaded that nothing, nothing whatsoever, shall be able to separate
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.960]   us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.080]   Neither life, nor death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.680]   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   Nothing whatsoever.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.120]   It is an absolute guarantee of that.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.920]   If your name is written in heaven, it is there and nothing shall separate you.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.640]   It is impossible.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:08.240]   Listen to this again in the book of Revelations in the third chapter and in the twelfth verse.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.600]   If your name is written in heaven, it means that Christ says this about you.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:18.960]   I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, which is the
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.560]   new Jerusalem, which cometh down from heaven from my God.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:30.520]   And I will write upon him my new name.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:36.360]   Had you ever thought of the Christian before as a kind of parcel?
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.480]   There is the parcel.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.040]   You look at the parcel and see what is written on it.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.140]   And you will find that the name of God is written upon it.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.160]   This passenger belongs to God.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   Where is he going to?
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.560]   He is going to the new Jerusalem.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.160]   He has got the stamp, the mark is on him.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.240]   He belongs to God.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.920]   He is a part of God's possession and that is his destination.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.520]   And it is certain.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.280]   Nothing can ever remove it.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:12.040]   So it is not surprising, is it, that the top lady said this?
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:19.000]   My name from the palms of his hands, eternity shall not erase.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.320]   Impressed on his heart it remains in marks of indelible grace.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.440]   And if that is true, he is entitled to go on and say the other thing he says, which
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.120]   is this.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:40.900]   More happy, but not more secure, the glorified spirits in heaven.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.320]   You see, if my name is written in heaven, I am absolutely certain of all that.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.900]   And lastly, I am certain of this.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:40:01.060]   That as I am thus destined for the new Jerusalem and for heaven, it means that I know for certain
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:08.300]   that I am going to have the priceless privilege of beholding the things that are to be seen
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.940]   in heaven.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.660]   You see, if my name is written in heaven, I know this, that a day is coming when I shall
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:21.620]   be there and I shall see God.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:28.480]   I shall attain to the summum bonum of the spiritual life, the vision of God.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.820]   I shall be a sharer in the beatific vision.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.220]   We shall see him.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:43.020]   We shall see our blessed Lord and see him face to face, no longer as in a glass darkly,
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.020]   but as he really is.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:51.740]   We shall see and shall share in that glory that baffles description.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.180]   If my name is written in heaven, it is a guarantee of all this.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.340]   Well now, our Lord tells us to rejoice in that, in things like that.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.840]   Rejoice in the fact that your names are written in heaven.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.460]   Now my friends, let me put the simple question to you.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:10.940]   Why is it that we don't spend more time in thinking of things like this?
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:16.420]   Surely if we spent our time in doing this, nothing could upset us.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.180]   Nothing could cause these fluctuations.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.980]   Nothing could upset us or disturb the even keel of our life.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:29.180]   Oh, let us decide together to look at this thing, the fact that our names are written
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.420]   in heaven and glory in nothing else.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:40.500]   Because it means to glory in God and in his Christ, in nothing and in no one else, but
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:45.060]   in him and in him alone.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:49.820]   So that leads to my last question.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.340]   Do we rejoice in this fact?
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.140]   Are we rejoicing in it?
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:01.100]   But ah, says someone, how do I know that my name is written in heaven?
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.140]   That's the question.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.300]   Christ tells me to rejoice in the fact that my name is written there.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.220]   How do I know that my name is written there?
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.420]   How can I know that my name is written there?
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.980]   Well, this is a great subject.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.300]   I can't answer it in a few words, but I can give you the headings.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.180]   You'll find it really expounded perfectly in the first epistle of John.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.420]   The whole point of that epistle is just to answer that question.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.340]   Here are some of the tests.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:31.260]   He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.480]   If you really believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ of God, the only begotten Son
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.980]   of God and the Savior of the world, the one who has made the way of redemption, you are
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.140]   born of God.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.140]   That means your name is written in heaven.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:48.940]   For no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.700]   And no man receives the Holy Ghost unless he is a child of God.
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.900]   That means his name is written in heaven.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.140]   Therefore, that's one test.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:05.340]   But if Christ is not your Savior, your name is not written in heaven and you cannot rejoice.
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:11.080]   The other test is keeping his commandments, being able to say that his commandments are
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.940]   not grievous but that we really delight in them, though we may occasionally fail to keep
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.940]   them.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:20.980]   But we want to, and that is our greatest desire.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.980]   What else?
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:29.660]   Well, we know that we have passed from death to life because we love the Brethren.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.540]   We love Christian people.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.180]   We prefer them to anybody else.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.120]   We realize they are the salt of the earth.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:43.180]   We really do love them and we rejoice in being with them.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.180]   Why?
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.940]   Because we know we are all destined for the same glorious eternity.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.140]   We are rejoicing in the same thing.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:58.220]   And the last test I'd mentioned this morning is that we have received the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.820]   How do we know that we have received the Spirit?
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:07.620]   Well, finally, the ultimate proof of the fact that my name is written in heaven is the fact
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:15.100]   that the Spirit witnesses and testifies within me that that is the case.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:19.100]   Shall I put it simply and in a personal form?
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:24.940]   In spite of all my imperfections and in spite of my sin, I know that my name is written
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.940]   in heaven.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.140]   I know it.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.500]   I know it by the witness of the Spirit.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.660]   I can't get away from it.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.260]   I know it's a fact.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.980]   It's the biggest thing in my life.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.100]   I have this consciousness given by the Spirit.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.860]   The Spirit testifies with my spirit that I am a child of God.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.180]   I don't understand it.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:52.820]   I am conscious of my terrible unworthiness, but I belong to him.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.860]   My name is written there.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.900]   I know I am going there.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:04.020]   It's the Spirit alone that gives that witness and that knowledge.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.900]   But he does another thing.
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.660]   He produces a certain fruit within us.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:15.060]   And if you are conscious of the fruit of the Spirit within you, you can be perfectly certain
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:23.980]   and happy that you are a child of God and that your name is written in heaven.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:37.180]   Well, I say again as I close, this is surely the only thing in which we should go on rejoicing.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:42.060]   Don't we feel rather ashamed of ourselves that we have ever rejoiced in anything else,
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:47.060]   that we have got excited about other things and talked with any mission and have become
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.060]   excited?
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.860]   I say, my friends, these other things, they come and go.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.620]   This is the thing.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:46:04.200]   In this rejoice that your name is written in heaven.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.980]   That it is in that book that will be opened, that you will hear it read out, that you pass
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:14.660]   from judgment to life, that there is no condemnation for you, that you belong to Christ, purchased
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:22.340]   by his blood, made a child of God and a special object of his affection and his care.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:29.060]   May God give us grace to look at this ever always, to keep this at the center of our
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:38.980]   lives, to be interested finally in nothing that belongs to self as such, but only interested
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:48.340]   in the fact that we are in this blessed relationship to God and that we are going on through this
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:58.860]   life of sorrow and of trouble and of trial to that glory where we and all who are there
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:10.780]   rejoice in nothing but in him and who spend their eternity in singing the praises of God
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.140]   and of the Lamb that once was slain.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:24.380]   In this rejoice not that the spirits are made subject unto you, but rejoice that your names
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:47.900]   are written in heaven.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:48:09.420]   Peace.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
