[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   - So when I wake up in the morning, for instance,
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.660]   like many people, I don't feel immediately alert.
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.540]   I don't feel like I could just dive into writing
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.740]   if writing is the most important thing I need to do that day
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.120]   or I have some transition time.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.880]   Do you think that people should embrace
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.840]   natural transition times on the timescale of a day
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.760]   or that they should train themselves
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.160]   to like, you know, bounce into effort,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160]   like go with the flow or force oneself through the door?
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.440]   - Well, how I relate to that personally,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.520]   I've spent a lot of time thinking about day architecture.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.640]   Well, I call it day architecture.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.640]   And I think there's some very systematic things we can do,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.200]   but I think like anything,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.920]   they should be individualized, right?
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   I don't think that everyone should follow a certain model
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.140]   'cause we're all very different.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.440]   You know that old book that,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.640]   Tim actually produced the audio book, "Daily Rituals"?
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   - Oh yeah.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.880]   - Like one of the best things about "Daily Rituals"
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.940]   is how few patterns there are through them.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.520]   It's just hilarious. - I love that book.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.520]   I'll put a link to it. - It's so brilliant.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.480]   - Such a good book.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.360]   - It breaks down the daily routine.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.480]   It's like two to three to four page chapters
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.440]   on like a hundred some brilliant artists
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.360]   and scientists and creators.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.160]   And they're just so random how they live.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.000]   - Some are out partying all night.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.640]   Drugs, alcohol, caffeine.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.960]   Others are super regimented and monk-like.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.840]   It's the range of daily architectures is so vast.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.680]   - So I think we need to have like that awareness
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920]   and that sense of humor and humility about it.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.240]   And we can get systematic and structured at the same time.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.560]   I think it's important to hold both of those.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.180]   I mean, what you just asked,
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.480]   I do believe that that beautiful period
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.600]   when we first wake up and that dream state is so powerful.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.960]   And I think that people, almost all people
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.620]   immediately pick up their phone and start checking messages,
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.680]   which just shuts down one's awareness
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.520]   of what's been happening beneath the surface all night.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.040]   So I think that that's a real lost opportunity.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.160]   I remember when I was 11 years old,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   I read this, my dad actually gave me this Hemingway essay
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.080]   on his creative process.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.920]   And there's one of my favorite,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.040]   sometimes there's like an insanely potent book
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.320]   that's put together.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.800]   And it's, two that come to mind are "Lessons of History,"
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.720]   which is this short compilation of Will and Ariel Durant,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.760]   two of the greatest historians
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.480]   who've published tens of thousands of pages.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.000]   This is a short compilation of a handful of thematic essays.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.560]   It's only like 100 pages of all their life's work
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.680]   boiled down to a few themes.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.960]   It's unbelievably potent.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.520]   And "Hemingway on Writing" is another book of that nature,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.440]   which takes all of Hemingway's from his books,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.260]   from his letters, private letters,
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.080]   from his articles and essays and notebooks,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.880]   like everything he's written about the creative process
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.180]   and boils it into this like short book
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.680]   on his principles of creativity, just unbelievable.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   But before that book came out, I read this piece,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.360]   the short thing he'd written about the creative process,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.200]   which was essentially,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.360]   he'd always leave a sentence unwritten.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.480]   He'd end his workday with a sentence like half written.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   So leaving with a sense of direction.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   And then he would let it go.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.680]   You know, he would go out drinking,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.480]   he would do all the things that Hemingway did.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.920]   And then he returned to it first thing in the morning
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.400]   and that like unwritten sentence
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.040]   has become a paragraph and a page in his mind
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.240]   and it would be a way to hit the ground running.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.840]   And that's what really spurred me
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.720]   to start creating this process in my chess life
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.220]   of always ending my chess study with something left,
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.180]   like posing my unconscious a question,
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.260]   like studying the complexity and then releasing it,
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.320]   which later became,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.740]   and then tapping into it first thing in the morning,
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.440]   pre-input, which later became my MIQ process.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.040]   And then I developed team-wide MIQ processes.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.080]   The teams that I work with all have versions of the MIQ
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.320]   that they utilize as individuals, but then as teams.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.560]   And it's an amazing way to develop
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.120]   a shared consciousness in a team,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.400]   to have everybody be able to tap into the question
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.520]   that's top of mind for every member of their team
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.360]   or for a leader to be able to be aware
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   of what is the most important question
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.600]   for every one of my scientists or my analysts or anything.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.540]   It's a really powerful way
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.900]   to cultivate shared consciousness.
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.100]   And it becomes our game tape.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.760]   Because if we're tracking our MIQs,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.060]   let's say I'm studying something for three weeks
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.100]   or for four weeks.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.320]   And what do I think is most,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.960]   if I'm tracking the questions that I think
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.500]   are most critical for that thing
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.720]   and I'm deepening my analysis of it,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.480]   what I arrive at, what I think in day one
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.640]   will be very different from the MIQ in day 14.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.100]   And then we can study the gap.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.680]   And then we can study the patterns of the gap, the gaps.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   And this is what I call MIQ gap analysis.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.640]   So if I'm setting a chess position,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.480]   like if I play a chess game against you
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.040]   and it's incredibly complex,
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.920]   and I don't quite understand this position,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.400]   and then I do a deep, deep analysis of it,
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.800]   what I'll arrive at after 14 or 16 or 18 hours of study
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.920]   will be different from what I felt during the game.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.620]   Now, what's interesting is,
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.280]   this is a cool thing about chess study.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.040]   If my understanding was here during the chess game,
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.380]   after like a few hours,
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.560]   I might be like really far away from that.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.080]   But after I've completed the study,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.640]   I'll usually be like very similar, but deeper.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.720]   So it's often like deeper,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.480]   like closer than where you were after a few hours of study,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   but it's like a deeper level in.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   But what's the gap between that and that,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.600]   between where I was in the game
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.220]   and what are the patterns in the gaps?
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.480]   And then if you think about those patterns in the gaps
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.320]   through those lenses of the technical,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.220]   the thematic, and the psychological, right?
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.760]   We deconstruct it in that way.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.820]   Then that becomes our game tape, right?
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.520]   One of the hardest things for mental athletes
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.940]   is to actually have game tape the way basketball players do,
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.980]   or foilers do, or fighters do,
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.480]   where you can see the actual game tape.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.460]   We need to create our mental game tape.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.020]   So this is a way that I,
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.040]   it both enhances the creative process
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.300]   and creates the game tape for the training process.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.200]   And then studying the gap analysis we do
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.280]   reveals what we need to focus our deliberate practice on.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.780]   - This difference between physical endeavors
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.240]   and cognitive endeavors, I think is so key.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.340]   Nowadays, most people are involved in cognitive endeavors,
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.820]   and there's so much,
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.840]   it's basically like being in a glass house
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.500]   with windows everywhere.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.380]   I mean, social media, texting, windows,
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.740]   internet connection on the computer.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.200]   There's just so many points of entry
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.680]   and where one can become distracted.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.720]   Whereas if you paddle out to ocean,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.360]   sure, you could bring your phone perhaps,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.160]   but you're limited by the environment
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   and the need for safety of the number of things
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.460]   that you can think about.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.260]   - Funny, I wore an Apple watch
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.760]   training a little bit on the ocean,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.520]   and it was good for me
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.220]   'cause I wanted to align my intuition on speed
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.880]   with what actually it was showing,
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.160]   and it was good to calibrate myself.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.940]   But man, I took it off.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.600]   It's so much better being on the ocean without technology.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.000]   - Yeah. - Like being liberated from it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.760]   Tracking, yeah.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.760]   - I'm learning to turn stuff off while I work.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.000]   I mean, I have had to learn to just fight things back
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.400]   because when I started in science,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.920]   I mean, I didn't have a smartphone.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.960]   I didn't have any of that.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.660]   And yet one really has to fight nowadays
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.280]   for their freedom from these interruptions.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.720]   So it's something that people really have to cultivate.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.600]   So in terms of the structure of that day,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.040]   you pose a question for the day,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.200]   like the most important question,
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.080]   would it be like, let's say,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.680]   like I'm working on a revision of this book
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.040]   that I delayed release on
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.020]   'cause I wanted to add a bunch of things to it.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.440]   So would one say, you know, the most important question is,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.920]   you know, how do I finish this book today?
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.240]   Or is there, I'm guessing it's more conceptual than that.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.680]   - I think that you can,
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.360]   I mean, it's a tool that one can utilize tactically
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.860]   or strategically, right?
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.280]   So it can be like, if you're in creative flow,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.120]   just leaving yourself with a sense of direction,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.840]   or it can actually be zooming out
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.920]   and thinking about like,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.800]   what is the highest order question
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.680]   that I'm grappling with, right?
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.940]   But I think it's like one wants to stretch for the,
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.420]   if one is doing the latter,
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.240]   the higher order strategic thinking,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.320]   it's like, you can think of like,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.160]   one is stretching for the question that matters most
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.240]   with the same kind of intellectual or cognitive intensity
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.240]   that one is experiencing, for example,
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.200]   pushing yourself from like 168 to 176
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.680]   in cardiovascular interval training, right?
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.200]   Like you're really stretching mentally.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   So you need to be at your stretch point.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.400]   Growth comes at the point of resistance, right?
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.960]   So we, like, but intellectually,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.480]   we're not used to really feeling
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   when we're at our stretch point.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.680]   So we're thinking about a question,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.400]   but that's a question, what's the higher order question?
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.960]   What's the higher order question?
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.240]   What's the question that really matters?
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.760]   And one way to frame it is like,
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.920]   our mind, if we're good at something,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.640]   slices like a knife through butter through most things,
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.560]   but then there's a place we're stuck.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.060]   Like those stuck points are the MIQs.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.880]   Those stuck points are like, right?
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.720]   Like we don't need to wait,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.320]   we don't need, like the mind will just get there,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.200]   like, oh, but that's the thing.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.920]   And then we explore there, like what, how do,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.600]   that stretch within that stuck point.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.720]   - And that's usually where people,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.520]   including myself, pivot away.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.300]   I'm thinking outside of the work domain now.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.280]   Like, like, ah, like I don't want to think about,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.720]   like it's when we tend to,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.400]   I noticed that there's an infinite amount
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.920]   of distraction available nowadays, if we want it.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.420]   And, you know, audio books and podcasts,
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.900]   and I think podcasts are wonderful,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.860]   but you know, they can be a source of distraction
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.600]   from the critical question we need to be asking,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.740]   or they can be a source of answers
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.180]   for perhaps the critical questions we're asking.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.000]   But there's just so,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.960]   there's so many of these opportunities
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.360]   to just look away from something that is like a,
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.680]   it's like a emotional infection.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   It's different than an infection in your skin
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.800]   that's nagging 'cause you can feel it there.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.600]   And you want to get that thing out, right?
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.960]   Very primal instinct, like get that thing out,
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.240]   get the infection out.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.340]   This is like an emotional infection
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.560]   that you can just kind of not see
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.040]   if you choose to turn away.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.320]   But those are the things that really get you over time.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.000]   - That's why we do our cold water training.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.880]   Like that's where we like,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.240]   we train at living on the other side of pain,
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.480]   of enjoying it.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.640]   Like that place, that place that like itches,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.040]   like ah, bounce away from that,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.400]   but that's where you need to sit, right?
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.800]   But we can practice that thematically,
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.400]   like loving that discomfort,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.480]   wanting it, hunting for it,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.040]   like finding the place where we're stuck,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.080]   and then letting it sit,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.360]   and then not bouncing away from it,
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.980]   but just releasing it and returning to it.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.960]   And we have insights, right?
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.000]   'Cause often in those moments,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   like where we have our insights are,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.040]   like when we wake up in the morning,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.280]   are in those stuck points.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.920]   And I find it's very interesting.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   I'm sure you've done this,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.360]   like I've done like hundreds of diagnostics
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.800]   with people on my teams,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.600]   like where do they have most of their creative breakthroughs?
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.080]   And so many of them are in the shower.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.920]   It's really interesting.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.760]   I think a big part of that is like
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.700]   the full body somatic immersion
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.920]   moves them out of conscious thinking,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.400]   into like, 'cause their mind is experiencing,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.000]   and then the release of the conscious mind
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.040]   allows the unconscious to run.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.280]   And then they tap into it.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.160]   - First thing in the morning
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.200]   is when I get my insights or understanding,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.280]   or when the truth hits me square in the face.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.400]   Well, like there's no avoiding.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.440]   I wake up, I think about like,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.080]   "Okay, that's the thing I got to deal with."
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.800]   And I tend to write it down right away,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.520]   try not to write it down on my phone.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.880]   I think having a point of capture
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.520]   that doesn't offer any other distractions,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.320]   that's why I'm a big believer in pen and paper.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.200]   - I 100% agree with you.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.960]   And like, so first of all, I agree.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.200]   First thing in the morning, that's the juice.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.720]   And the whole MIQ process is geared toward
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.480]   harnessing that, like tapping into that, right?
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480]   Like feeding the mind.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.720]   'Cause that just happened to me so many dozens of times,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.560]   where I would just have the insight in the morning,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.480]   but then I realized,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.280]   I should be finding the areas of stuckness
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.840]   and feeding it to myself to have the insight about.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.240]   So it's like directing that creative process.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.880]   But then if we open up our phones,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.960]   like if the moment we start to see emails
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.840]   without reading them or see anything,
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.880]   we're unconsciously solving for what's in the emails.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.620]   - Yeah, it's all stimulus response.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.460]   You're going into stimulus.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.400]   So if people can start to think about being reflective
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.840]   versus in stimulus response,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.960]   I think that's sort of like the widest binning of all this.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.800]   I have to say the shower.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.920]   I've talked about this thing
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.440]   about why people have insights in the shower with my friend.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.880]   I'd love to introduce you to him at some point.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.360]   We've been friends since we were seven years old.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   My friend, Dr. Eddie Chang, he's a neurosurgeon
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.920]   and the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.880]   And he studies speech and language.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.760]   And he's taken people with locked-in syndrome
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.000]   and developed AI algorithms
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.520]   so that they can speak through a screen
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.560]   with their face moving in real time
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.160]   by decoding human speech or human speech cortex.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.020]   And a truly brilliant individual.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.640]   He's been on this podcast, he'll come back again.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.840]   Ask him about the shower thing.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.440]   'Cause he used to work on neuroplasticity
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.640]   of the auditory system.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.320]   We think, we wonder if it's the kind of white noise
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.680]   of the shower as well.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.540]   - Yeah.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.980]   - Because Eddie's done beautiful work showing
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.500]   that it's the signal to noise in the auditory system
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.320]   that defines whether or not a certain pattern of speech
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.140]   or auditory cue gets remembered.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.320]   So when you have this in the background,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.600]   let's just put this in the terms
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.040]   that we've been referring to this up until now.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.520]   The thoughts that surface above that noise
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.960]   have a big sharp peak relative to the background.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.340]   So it's the signal to noise.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.080]   Whereas certainly the opposite would be
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.700]   when you're on your phone and you're scrolling through
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.480]   and you're looking at all the thoughts and feelings
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.380]   and stuff of other people.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.200]   So how do you capture your own thoughts
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.920]   in terms of which are, and filter them
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.680]   through what's meaningful and what's not meaningful
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.220]   is I think actually a really important question
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.440]   to begin with.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   And white noise background with very deprived,
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.900]   you know, visual stimulation,
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.600]   most showers aren't that interesting.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.080]   It's white noise, blank walls,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.880]   a few things that are familiar to you.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.240]   So they basically disappear from your visual field.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.360]   And the idea is that thoughts then can,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.220]   that are constantly geysering up
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.840]   through your unconscious mind can be captured
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.040]   because everything else is noise.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.860]   Perhaps this is a hypothesis.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.960]   And maybe I'll put you and Eddie together sometime
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.800]   and just be an observer.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.200]   - Yeah, I'd love that.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.400]   That's powerful.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.500]   - So, I mean, that's how we learn language.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.760]   It's the error signals against the background noise.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.320]   It's all, that's just how you fix stutter.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.480]   It's a, you create background noise.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.360]   You increase noise to which actually elevates signal
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.720]   in the auditory system, oddly, in any case.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.760]   - So you found that four and a half hours
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.720]   was the sweet spot of a focused work,
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.400]   but for some people, it might be an hour.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.560]   They might need to train up that level of focus.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.840]   - Well, and if it's four and a half hours,
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.600]   it's not like that's like a lot,
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.080]   the rest of the day is feeding into
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.720]   like those being brilliant, right?
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.080]   So if it's four and a half hours of creative output time,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.000]   then there are other periods where one can do,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.860]   have inputs that feed it, right?
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.800]   I think that's very good for people
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.560]   to have an awareness of what their energy,
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.040]   like what their peaks and valleys are
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.640]   of their energy throughout the day,
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.400]   and then align their peak creativity work
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.000]   with their peak energy periods.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.920]   I think it's really important
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.600]   to not be in a constantly reactive state.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.640]   One of the things I find fascinating
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.400]   is how people will have meetings scheduled everywhere,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.720]   and then fit their thinking between meetings,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.080]   and how liberating it is for them
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.880]   when they actually now block out their time
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.040]   for creative output time, right?
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.520]   Like it might be color-coded in their calendar,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.600]   and then have meetings fit around there.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.680]   So their day is driven by their self-expression
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.320]   as opposed to by a constant set of reactivity,
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.800]   and just more, and more, and more, and more, right?
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.160]   I think harnessing the undulation of stress and recovery
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   throughout the day is hugely important.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.320]   I think having workouts throughout the day,
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   even micro-workouts during the day,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.880]   meditation periods during the work day,
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.480]   everything being quality over quantity, right?
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.700]   We can get so much more done.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.000]   And if you think about it,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.380]   like, I mean, you talk about like
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.840]   elite performing competitive teams.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   It's all about, like if you saw how much video analysis
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.480]   and time that the Boston Celtics coaching staff
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.800]   puts into what ends up being like a 35-second clip
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.080]   that's shown to a player or the team,
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   like it's so much work to then the most potent thing, right?
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.240]   It's like when you're an elite,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.760]   because like the players are doing something so intense,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.640]   right, like it's all about quality, not quantity.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.120]   They're not training basketball 17 hours a day.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.720]   They could not possibly play then.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.800]   Or they're training brilliantly for like,
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.320]   you know, maybe an hour and a half a day, brilliantly,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.680]   but like scientifically, right?
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.640]   Or if they're playing for a two and a half
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.600]   to three hour game, right?
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.180]   Then what's the way to optimize for that?
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.840]   You don't stack six hours of training in
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.200]   before three hour game, no.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.680]   So much of it is, you know, body work and setting some tape
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.800]   and then being primed in the right way
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.040]   to remember what you're looking at on tape
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.900]   and then taking breaks and returning to it.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.340]   And then you're like understanding exactly
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.860]   how much load is on your body and your mind
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.540]   and having your sleep right and your nutrition right
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.740]   and getting everything optimized
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.680]   and then being a peak performer when it's on, right?
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.540]   But we don't have that discipline as mental beings
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.940]   very often, but we should in our creative process,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.140]   in our relationships, right?
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.500]   In the art of being a mom or a dad or a husband or a wife
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.020]   or a friend, like why wouldn't we be cultivating ourselves
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.660]   and being brilliant at that?
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.500]   Like I really believe in quality as a way of life.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.620]   That's another very important principle for me.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.580]   That we're either practicing sloppiness
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.420]   or we're practicing quality.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.860]   If we do something shitty, then we're practicing shitty.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.740]   And that will, just how like we can harness
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.700]   the thematic interconnectedness on the positive side,
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.060]   we can also really harness it brilliantly
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.480]   on the negative side.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.980]   Every time we practice being sloppiness,
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.100]   we're using thematic interconnectedness
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.260]   to be sloppy in everything.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.760]   I really believe that.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.480]   So quality as a way of life is a beautiful way
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.580]   to practice quality everywhere
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.420]   'cause it will manifest everywhere, right?
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.380]   Not in a way that's like robotic or constrictive.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.180]   No, in a way that's self-expressive and beautiful.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.540]   - Living one's life like a work of art.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.180]   - Yes, beautiful.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.140]   Amen.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.760]   (upbeat music)
