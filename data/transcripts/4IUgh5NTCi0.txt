[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Well, what legitimate authority does Satan have over this world?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.200]   It's a very important question and it arrives today from a listener named Aaron in Texas.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.480]   Hello Pastor John, in Matthew 4.9 and in Luke 4.6, what authority is Satan talking about?
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.860]   Is he lying that he has authority to give or does he truly have authority over the earth?
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.520]   If so, what is it and how does this relate to God's complete sovereignty over all things?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.080]   Here's what the devil actually said to Jesus at the temptation in the wilderness that creates
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.000]   the question we were just asked.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.760]   Matthew 4.8, "Then the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.800]   kingdoms of the world and their glory.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.160]   And he said to him, 'All these I will give to you if you fall down and worship me.'"
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.040]   And here's Luke 4.5, "The devil took him and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:15.320]   a moment of time and said to him, 'To you I will give all this authority and their glory,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.240]   for it has been delivered to me, and I will give it to whom I will.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.120]   If you then will worship me, it will be yours.'"
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:39.260]   So my first answer is, if Jesus had worshipped Satan, of course Jesus would have abdicated
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.200]   his divine authority.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.580]   He would have ceased to be God.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.760]   If he were worshipping the devil, he wouldn't be God.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.180]   The devil would be God.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.940]   And yes, Satan would then give him the whole world and still control the world, because
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.040]   Jesus would not be God, he'd be Satan's lackey.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.360]   All of which, of course, did not and could not happen.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.280]   And Satan, as usual, was a fool to suggest it.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.440]   He's an idiot.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.040]   He's always saying stupid half-true things.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.700]   But notice the words of Luke 4:6.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:21.240]   Satan is not the ultimate authority in the world, because in Luke 4:6 he admits this,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.760]   "I can give all this authority because it has been delivered to me."
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   Ah.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.480]   Namely, by whom?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.660]   God.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.140]   In his sovereignty, God considered it wise, as part of his curse on the world after the
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:51.740]   fall of Adam and Eve, to give Satan a huge power in this world.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.860]   But he doesn't have ultimate power.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.860]   We're not dualists.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.180]   We don't think there's God and Satan duking it out for power in the universe.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.460]   God is God, not Satan.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.180]   Satan is not God.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.100]   All Satan's power is by permission.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:20.520]   He has no autonomy to do anything God does not permit for infinitely wise purposes.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.560]   So we see Satan given permission to afflict Job, right?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.640]   This is the same kind of paradigm.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:37.160]   The Lord said to Satan in Job 1:12, "Behold, all that he has is in your hand, only against
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.240]   him don't stretch out your hand."
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.560]   So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.820]   All his acts of opposition to God, all his acts of opposition to God's people, are part
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:59.160]   of God's plan as he gives Satan permission to exercise tremendous power in this world.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.920]   Nevertheless, Satan's sway in this world is terrible and vast.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.500]   Here's what we read.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.640]   This is 1 John 5:19, "The whole world lies in the power of the evil one."
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.340]   Or Ephesians 2, 1 and 2, "You were dead in trespasses and sins in which you once walked,
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.280]   following the course of this world, following the"—note this phrase—"prince of the
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.640]   power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience."
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.240]   Or 2 Corinthians 4:4, "The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers."
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.360]   Or John 14:30, Jesus says in his last night, "I will no longer talk much with you, for
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.520]   the ruler of this world is coming," meaning coming against me tonight, the ruler of the
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   world.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.600]   But the note of the New Testament, the note that is struck in the New Testament is that
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:17.840]   in Christ's death and resurrection, the decisive blow against Satan has been struck.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.240]   And as he comes against Jesus in his final hours, Jesus says, John 12:31, "Now is the
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.880]   judgment of this world.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.260]   Now will the ruler of this world be cast out."
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.360]   Or Luke 22:53, he says, "The ruler of this world is judged."
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.400]   No, that was John 16:11, "The ruler of this world is judged."
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.740]   And here's Luke 22:53, Jesus says—I love this phrase, it's just so sovereign—"This
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.840]   is your hour and the power of darkness."
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.140]   You get an hour.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.360]   You get one hour.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.080]   I know when it starts, I know when it ends.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.080]   That's your hour.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.040]   It's all by sovereign permission that you can do your dastardly deed in Judas and in
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.440]   me tomorrow morning.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:20.320]   The most important passage on Satan's defeat in the cross of Christ is Colossians 2, 13-15.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.200]   Goes like this, "You who were dead," that's us, us Christians, "You who were dead in your
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.600]   trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with Him, having
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   forgiven us all our trespasses by canceling the record of death that stood against us
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.400]   with its legal demands."
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.440]   That's a sweet sentence.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.200]   The entire record of your life that you regret, canceled.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.000]   "This he set aside, nailing it to the cross."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.440]   And here comes the decisive Satan verse.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.560]   "He disarmed," so in dying for your sins, in nailing your record of debts to the cross,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.380]   he disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to an open shame by triumphing over
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.900]   them in him.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:16.320]   So he disarmed them by nailing our record of debts to the cross.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   Because Satan's power is this, he's a great accuser.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.720]   Nothing in his court folder, as he stands before the bar to accuse us, if he has nothing
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.640]   in his folder, what's he gonna do?
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.060]   Powerless in this courtroom, because our record of debts has been canceled.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:42.240]   So his one damning weapon against God's elect is taken out of his hand, namely unforgiven
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   sin.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.720]   There is no unforgiven sin anymore.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.840]   We're forgiven, so what's he gonna condemn?
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   Nothing.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:57.880]   So now, in every battle with the devil, we can have total confidence of final victory,
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:06.360]   which is why Romans 8, 38 says what it says, "I am sure that neither death nor life nor"—now,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:13.420]   these are demonic beings—"nor angels nor rulers nor anything else nor present nor things
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:19.880]   to come nor powers," satanic powers, "nor height nor depth nor anything else in all
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.800]   creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.200]   He has been decisively defeated.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:35.320]   A friend told me once that when he was converted in college, along with several other athletes—he's
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:42.840]   a big hulking football player type, and he was converted by an old elderly woman, a petite
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.360]   woman—and she hosted in discipleship groups at her house these football players, you know,
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.240]   twice the size of her.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:59.360]   And she insisted, as her discipleship method, that every one of them say, after their conversion,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   one hundred times a week, "He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world,"
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   1 John 4:4.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:16.400]   And I thought, wow, that's a wise way to start a Christian life, because that's really
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   true.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   Amen, and profound.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.600]   Aaron, thanks for the question.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.400]   For everything you need to know about this podcast, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.600]   Well, self-love is a loud mantra in our culture.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.800]   It echoes in our advertising, and it's on repeat in our social media feeds.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.040]   Self-love is becoming inseparable from our cultural image in America.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.120]   Self-love is just what we do.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.720]   So do we need to learn to love ourselves more as Christians?
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.760]   It's an important question from a high school teen, a listener to the podcast, and it's
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.960]   on Friday.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   Next time.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.160]   We'll see you then.
