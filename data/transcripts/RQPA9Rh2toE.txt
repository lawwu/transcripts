[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, I think we have time for one more question.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   Let's do one from Linda.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.900]   Linda asks, do you have any general advice for a master student
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.000]   in the sciences choosing a thesis topic?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.400]   Is the topic more, less, or as important as location, people,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.600]   the lab, nature of work, topic relevance?
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.500]   Does it really matter in the long run
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.400]   what the topic is?
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.700]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.800]   I'm looking at the elaboration here because the fact you said
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500]   master's degree and not PhD
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.900]   gives a very different answer.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.600]   So if we were talking about a dissertation, especially if you
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000]   wanted to do an academic job, there's a lot of things that
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   really matter there.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.600]   I mean, so if you wanted an academic job and this was a PhD
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000]   dissertation, I would say
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.600]   you want to choose an advisor
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.500]   who lots of universities wish they could hire, but they can't
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.700]   because that advisor is already at this really good school and
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.500]   is very happy.
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.000]   And what you want to then do is basically become the low-cost
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.100]   alternative for that advisor by mastering whatever she does or
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.800]   whatever he does, that approach that you are their protege, that
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.300]   if they can't hire her, well, at least they can hire you because
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.600]   you're younger and on the market.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.200]   That's the best way to open up your options in a PhD environment.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.800]   Master's degree is a little bit different.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.500]   In your elaboration, you say that
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.700]   you don't want to go into doctoral graduate school after
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.100]   this, you want to go into industry.
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.500]   So then I would say topic really matters from a
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.100]   what skill is valuable in the industry right now.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.000]   Master's degrees are short, couple years.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.800]   So you don't have to worry like with a PhD what's going to be
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   popular six years from now.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.900]   You can just say what type of job do I want?
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.300]   I want a job in one of these type of organizations.
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.600]   What is the thing they're looking for right now?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.900]   Let me find a way to do a master's degree that would force
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.500]   me to learn that skill and show I'm good at it.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.300]   Very simple.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.500]   It's a skill that's going to be on your resume that an
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.800]   employer in the next year or two is going to look at.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.300]   Think ahead what skill you want them to see.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.900]   So I would see that almost entirely as an exercise in
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.900]   skill, useful skill acquisition.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.400]   All right.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.300]   Oh.
