[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   One of the strategies I've used in the past is if you're going on a big international trip,
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.820]   and I would say this is probably earlier in your miles and points journey, right? Earlier in the
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.140]   journey, I wasn't even thinking about business class. I was like, I just got enough points to
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.540]   take a trip internationally. Why would I use twice as many points to go in business class? Who cares?
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380]   Like, I want to take two trips. So it was like, how do I get into lounges? How do I get this better
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.700]   experience? How do I pick the seats, get the free bags, all that. And there's a lot of international
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.720]   airlines where you can status match. And maybe they'll only give you status for three months
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.760]   until you fly on them. But if you're going to take one trip, and you're going to Greece,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.380]   if you have a GN status for three months, that's all you need. And so there are a couple times where
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.220]   I would status match to an airline, and they immediately give you the status for three months.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.260]   And I would use it in those three months to get a lot of benefits. And then I would never take that
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.280]   flight. I would never credit it. I would never get any perks, never get any benefits beyond that.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.880]   But it made that one trip a lot more enjoyable.
