[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   [Korean Newsreel]
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   A jubilant newsreader on state TV announced that the bomb test had been a complete success.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   The test reported as a success on North Korean state television,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   this time involving what they say is a hydrogen bomb that could be mounted onto an ICBM
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped by the U.S. in World War II.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Saber rattling between international leaders is a military tactic probably as old as saber swords themselves.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   But when those sabers are nuclear warheads, the threats come with a very sharp edge to them.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Over the past several months, our president here in the States and the leader of North Korea
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   have exchanged threats via state media and mass media and social media.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   North Korea has been testing nuclear bombs and perfecting its long-range missile program.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   In response, our president has said about future threats this.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And in a speech he went so far as to say this.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Those are strong words and they are backed with movement as we speak.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   The U.S. has three aircraft carrier strike groups in the Western Pacific,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   a significant military buildup meant to get North Korea's attention.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And with international attention so high, we get this question from Amber in Virginia.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hello, Pastor John. I love your podcast and your overall ministry has deeply impacted me.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   North Korea has been in the news a lot lately with threats of a nuclear attack.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Christians around me are starting to fear.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I know many Christians who talk of stocking food, water and supplies,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and even a few considering buying and installing an underground bomb shelter in the event of such an attack.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   When it comes to this new Cold War era, new to a lot of us, how should Christians plan wisely?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Well, I need to make a confession right off the bat here.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   That 18 years ago, as Y2K approached, does anybody even remember?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   There was all this hysteria about how the computers would not know how to handle the switch from the 1900s to the 2000s.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And so there would be major infrastructure breakdowns and electricity would go off.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Water would go off. Everybody would be forced off the grid.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And there would be rioting in the streets and no food available for weeks.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   As I watched this hysteria work its way into the church, I frankly was disgusted.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Sorry, this is a confession.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I watched Christians justify their own fear and self-protection
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   by saying they would use their generator and their extra food for ministry purposes.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Really? I wonder if the watching world saw it that way.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Well, I didn't see it that way.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   To me, that very bent towards self-preservation and hoarding was a bad ministry in itself.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   It all made me angry, and I preached that this was not the mindset of the church in the New Testament.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And when I say, "Let me confess this," I do mean that there probably was sin on my part in some of what I felt about the preppers during Y2K.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But I still feel most of what I felt.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So I may have to confess again. May God help me.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So if you're one of those folks, you're just not going to get a lot of sympathy from me.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And I'll try to explain why in the next few minutes.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So here we go. I've got, what, I don't know, one, two, three, four, five notes jotted here as to why.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Number one, danger and risk are normal for the Christian life, not exceptional.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And the dominant New Testament approach to this fact is not self-protection, but self-sacrifice, the sacrifices of love.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That's the flavor. That's the tone that we should see and experience.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   For example, Paul describes his life like this, "Countless beatings, often near death.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Five times I received at the hands of Jews forty lashes, less one.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   A night and a day I was adrift at sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   danger from false brothers in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night in hunger and thirst,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   often without food, in cold and exposure."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Jesus had promised that's the way it would be.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   "You will be delivered up, even by parents, brothers, relatives, friends.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Some of you they will put to death. You'll be hated by all for my namesake.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Not a hair of your head will perish when they cut your head off.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   By your endurance you will gain your life."
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Now, how in the world did Paul press on? What was his bomb shelter?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "At my first defense, no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   May it not be charged against them, but the Lord stood by me and strengthened me,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed to the Gentiles.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So I was rescued from the lion's mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So you can see what he means there. "Evil deeds will not destroy my faith.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I may die, but I'll make it to the heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever and ever."
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So that's number one. Number two.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "Major efforts at self-preservation are inevitably going to obscure to the world
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   the basic message of Jesus, namely Matthew 16, 24.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   "If any one would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   For whoever would save his life will lose it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Number three.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   "If you are known as a person who devotes lots of money and effort and focus on creating a refuge,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   it is going to make the Psalms sound hollow in your mouth.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   You are my rock and my fortress, and for your sake you lead me and guide me.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You are my refuge." Or Psalm 61, 3.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   "For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy." Or Psalm 62, 7.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   "On God rests my glory, my rock, my refuge is God.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Trust in him at all times, O peoples, pour out your heart before him.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   God is a refuge for us."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The text of the five missionaries who went to the Warani tribe in 1956
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and were all killed by the spears, here's their text.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I will say to the Lord, 'My refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.'
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   He will cover you with his pinions and under his wings you will find refuge.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   His faithfulness is a shield and buckler.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor destruction that wastes at noonday."
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Number four, it is allowed in Scripture when danger comes to flee or to stand and suffer.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   John Bunyan, who spent 12 years in prison for standing,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   wrote to defend both possible paths of obedience as biblical, to flee or to stand.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   So when it comes to what I want to emphasize, what I'm doing right now, what I preach,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I just don't think Americans need more encouragement to flee.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Pastorally and prophetically, that's just not the need of the hour.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   To encourage Americans, 'Oh, you really should stop being so risky.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   You really should stop suffering so much. You really should stop so much self-sacrifice.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Let's all be more self-protective in our bunkers.'
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I just don't think pastorally and prophetically the need is almost entirely in the other direction.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And finally, number five, it misrepresents the value of Christ and heaven
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   to give the impression that death is the worst thing that could happen.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   If we are really doing all our self-preservation out of love,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   what about the people who are going to die eternally for lack of the gospel?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Are we taking the same steps as serious to preserve them for eternity?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Bottom line, how can we make Christ look like he really is the supreme treasure of our lives?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   How can we say to the world, Psalm 63, 3, "The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life."
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for pushing back against this dominant self-protective impulse that we feel.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of your week.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Three times a week we publish and you can subscribe to our audio feeds

[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Even questions as they relate to the place where your Christian faith and hope and trust intersect with headlines in the news.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.

[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   While gossip is no small problem, even for Christians, spreading damaging reports about others comes so naturally to all of us.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   But why? Why does gossiping about others feel so good?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And what can be done to confront this tendency inside of us?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   That's the question on Monday.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a great weekend and we will see you back here on Monday.
