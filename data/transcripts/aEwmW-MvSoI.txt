[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.540]   - Okay, good question.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.120]   That's semi-fast, that's semi-fast.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.040]   Do we have another one?
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.440]   How are we doing with time?
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.700]   - Yeah, we have one more question.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.380]   This is a question about studying for the GMAT
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.380]   and then at the tail end, she's also juggling job hunting.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.780]   So we'll take a listen to what Lindsay has to say.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.620]   - All right.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.740]   - This is Lindsay.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.060]   I'm a huge fan of your work.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.060]   I am wondering if you could speak to two things.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.060]   The first is most effective way to study for the GMAT test.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:48.180]   I took it back in 2011.
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.820]   I have to retake it now that I'm applying to school again
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.540]   for something else because they have changed the test
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.060]   and there's so many guides and books
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.700]   in online courses out there that I don't know,
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.100]   I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.580]   So if you could speak to that
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.580]   or like generally standardized higher education.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460]   - Jessica, can we pause here right there?
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.820]   - Secondly, effective--
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.140]   - So let me answer her first part
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.860]   and then we'll get our second part if that works
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.020]   because GMAT, I have a simple answer
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.820]   for any of those standardized tests.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.660]   Doing sample test under the real time conditions
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.500]   is by far the actual best practice.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.820]   I can do real sample test and get this score
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.700]   under those conditions, then you will get that score
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.540]   in the real test.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.940]   If you can't, you won't.
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.900]   The only thing you do is use books.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.420]   I don't think you need the online courses.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.140]   Get books to learn the techniques they recommend
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.700]   for each of the different types of sections.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.300]   So like, okay, I'm gonna study these type of questions
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.300]   and look at the techniques.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.100]   Now I'm gonna try it under time conditions.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.660]   Then I'll go back and deconstruct the answers I got wrong,
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.620]   figure out how to answer them right,
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.060]   see if I'm missing any techniques.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.020]   Why did I get that wrong?
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.700]   Was it a mistake or I didn't know how to do it?
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.820]   And then do it again under time conditions.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.100]   And that's it.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.580]   I mean, this is how I did, for example, the GRE
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.660]   when I was applying to graduate school in computer science,
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.540]   most of these schools cared only about your math section.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.300]   I knew you needed a high 700s in the math
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.660]   to be in contention for any of these schools.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.860]   They preferred 800, but I gamed it out and was like,
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.180]   okay, high 700s would be enough.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.580]   And that's all I did.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.060]   Like, okay, let me read a book
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460]   about the different types of questions
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.620]   and the techniques they recommend.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620]   Sample test, how'd I do?
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.740]   Try again, try again.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.940]   Okay, I'm in the high 700s.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.220]   Go, took the test and we're done.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.740]   So that's the way to prepare, nothing else fancy.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.980]   Get in real conditions, do the test,
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.660]   figure out what you got wrong.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.020]   Look at one book on techniques,
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.500]   but it's really a game of practicing.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.100]   (upbeat music)
