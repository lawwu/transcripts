[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   I talked to the guy who invented the first laser and actually held one in my hand.
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.000]   The first laser is supposedly in the Smithsonian, but he said, "They don't have it.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   They got one in the lab and I took my first one home.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   Do you want to see it?"
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   I said, "God, of course."
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.360]   And we went to the Cordenza in his dining room and he opened the drawer and pulled out
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360]   a little box.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.240]   And inside it was basically a cylinder of aluminum about the size of a little film can,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.280]   which he opened up and took out a man-made ruby cylinder that was half silvered on each
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.120]   end, surrounded by a very high intensity flash bulb.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   And that was it.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.800]   It was this beautiful, simple machine, but he said, "They didn't get the right one."
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   I said, "When did you get the right one?"
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.360]   He said, "They didn't ask me."
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.960]   And he was angry all his life because he wasn't included in the Nobel Prizes.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.400]   He went to the theoreticians who first theorized a laser, but he built the first laser.
