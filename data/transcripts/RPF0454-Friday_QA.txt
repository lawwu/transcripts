[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.920]   It's Friday, that means it's time for another Q&A. I've got the phone lines queued up
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880]   and five callers on the line. Let's get after it.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:39.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.120]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, the show dedicated to providing you with the
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.640]   knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.880]   and I am your host. Welcome to Friday Q&A.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:11.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.400]   These Friday Q&A shows are my favorite shows of the week. These are the shows where I show up to
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.320]   a phone line and I get to talk to you. I love it. I get so much energy out of talking to people
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.160]   that I often don't get. I have to manufacture the energy when I record the show by myself,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.920]   but when I talk to people, real live people, it gives me just a ton of energy. The way it works
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.400]   is the callers have called into a conference line here, and so we're going to go to them one at a
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.960]   time as we go through. These Friday Q&A calls are open primarily to patrons of the show. Although
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.360]   today I sent out the invitation for this call to subscribers to the Radical Personal Finance email
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.680]   list. I've been working hard to communicate more and more with you via email. As a reward for those
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.560]   who have given me their email address, then I am allowing the email list onto these calls.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.200]   If I had my perfect world, I probably would love to do a daily call-in radio show. I'd love to do
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.920]   that. I just haven't figured out how to make that work, nor have I particularly pursued it. The way
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   the radio business works, it's... Anyway, I haven't decided to pursue that, but I do love doing these
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.280]   on Friday. We've got some great questions. If you'd like to join a future call,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.960]   please make sure that you sign up to become a patron of the show. That'll be the most consistent
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.040]   thing because sometimes I get too many callers off the email list, and so some of you guys get
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.360]   locked out. Or you can take a chance if you're cheap and you don't want to send me any money,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.320]   that's okay. Or if you're just working on other financial goals, that's okay too.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.720]   Then what you can do is join the email list, and then you'll receive invitations to these calls,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.680]   possibly from time to time. We're going to start with Shaz in Tallahassee. Shaz,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   what's your question? How can I serve you today, please?
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:06.800]   So yes, I'm 48. My husband is 58. We're both late bloomers. We started retirement four years
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.760]   ago because we're busy doing other things in our 20s, 30s, and 40s. No children. I've got a six
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.040]   figure job now because I went back to school, and we have student loans as a result, 100,000.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:34.240]   Small house of 100,000 square feet, we owe about 155 on that. And we have possibilities of maxing
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   out our retirement. We have a four, three B, 457, 18 can go into each. So the question is,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:52.800]   since we are older, what do we do? I mean, which sequence should we follow? Should we max out the
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.400]   retirement while paying off our debt, and then paying off our house, and then potentially thinking
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.120]   about buying a rental? How much does your husband earn at his job?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   He earns 25,000.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.680]   Okay. So you're at about 100, and he's at 25, give or take?
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.600]   So now I just got a raise. So I'm actually at about 150 with the overtime that I do.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.000]   And so next year, it's going to be 175. This year, it was 150 together.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.240]   Great. So the point is you got a high income, and because both of those are all wages,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.120]   is all of your compensation paid to you as wages?
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.360]   Yes.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.640]   Okay. So you're in a high tax bracket. And that's a big, big deal in terms of
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.520]   figuring out the answer to this question. You said that you started retirement four years ago. By
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.760]   that, do you mean you started saving for retirement four years ago?
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:56.640]   I just actually just maxed, just did the match, and just started paying off the debt,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.560]   like throwing $2,000 a month at it. That's what I was saying. Yes.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.120]   Right.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.800]   So before, yes. We have no savings. Yes, we have savings, and it's $10,000. So that's
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.520]   really everything in a nutshell. Very simple.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.160]   Why didn't you save for retirement earlier in life, such that you weren't then,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.680]   but now you've decided to start saving for retirement? What changed for you?
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:29.120]   Well, I think it was just we had a lot of useful energy. We just wanted to live life.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.600]   We only lived once. I came from a working class background, and I always vowed to myself when I
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.880]   was young, "I just want to buy whatever I want, live the way I want." And it was just not on my
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.400]   radar. And so now I've become, I read this book, Money or Your Life, and I guess you just get
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   older and you just become more mature. It's like, "Wow, what have I been doing?" And I've made
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.720]   financial mistakes, including bankruptcy 15 years ago. So it's just, I don't know. I just grew up.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.320]   Okay.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.200]   Both of us.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.000]   Real quick on the bankruptcy, was that a result of something catastrophic and unexpected,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.600]   such as a medical expense or a lawsuit? Or was it just simply due to you had accumulated debt over
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.920]   time due to gradual overspending, and at some point it became too much for you?
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.160]   Yeah, poor financial choices and a relationship that I was in as well.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.920]   Got it. Okay. So when you and your husband just got out of, finished school, got this great job,
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.040]   earning a lot of money, when you guys talk about retirement now, what does that mean to you? What
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.680]   do you want to do?
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.360]   So honestly, we don't really talk about it. I'm the only one thinking about it because my husband
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.520]   is still like, "Oh, it's going to work out." So when I think about retirement, I think about
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:01.200]   volunteering and pursuing things that really are non-monetarily, like going out to the third world,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.640]   maybe working with Doctors Without Borders. It's usually some kind of altruistic work. And my
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:15.520]   husband is interested as well, so that's not something I could pursue monetarily.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.240]   Do you have any connection or attachment to this job or career that you're engaged in now,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.840]   emotionally? Do you like doing it?
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:31.360]   I like it. I like it enough. It's not, it pays well, and it's something that I can do with my
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.280]   volunteer work. And that's where I would be interested in. I'm a nurse anesthetist, so I
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.960]   could provide anesthesia to people in the third world who don't have access to surgery. And that's
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.520]   something where my heart would go out to. That's what I would enjoy doing at some point. So yes,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.920]   I would like to just do it part-time. I don't want to be in the operating room full-time with no
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:02.240]   windows for 30 years or so. So when you are talking about on your shows, like I could retire,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.600]   but I would, if I did this job, I would only want to do it part-time.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.920]   If I have to do it for the next 40 years.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.720]   If you did this job part-time, how much do you think you could earn in today's market?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.320]   I could probably earn $80,000.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.640]   And how much are your monthly living expenses right now,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.840]   not including your student loan payments or extra payments?
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.280]   Includes the mortgage?
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.580]   Yes.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:37.200]   Okay. Then that would be, I also support my mom's about $3,500.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.120]   Including the support for your mom, it's about $3,500 a month?
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.040]   Okay. And how much of that is your mortgage payment?
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:52.160]   My mortgage is $1,040, and that includes everything tax and home insurance.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.200]   Okay. If you were to be a nurse, what would you do?
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:08.000]   If you were doing your job part-time, how long could you imagine your career?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.440]   How long do you think you could keep working in your career?
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.200]   Until what age?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.280]   Probably at least until 70.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:25.120]   Okay. Well, the most important thing is going to be
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:33.920]   to clarify what is important to you and your husband in this second half of your life.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.720]   That's going to be the most important thing.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:44.000]   If you look forward over the next 50 years and you imagine what a perfect life looks like,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.200]   you've got to get very clear on that perspective.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.960]   I don't know if you are accustomed to thinking in 50-year time blocks or not.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.240]   Do you think of yourself as having another 50 years in front of you that you've got to plan for?
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   I don't think in 50 years, but I do think it's a good potential of being alive in 50 years,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.280]   because all of my family in the German side, they're like 100 years old.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.720]   But I could imagine that.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.800]   Good. So a lot of people, the reason I'm using this is a lot of people,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.600]   when they first come to an age where they're 50 years old,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.320]   they might be thinking, "Oh, I'm going to die at 70 or 75."
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.800]   But realistically, you especially, because you're a woman and you're likely to outlive your husband,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.240]   you need to be thinking in terms of a 50-year time block.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.400]   And that's going to be your planning.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.240]   If you think in terms of 50 years, it should dramatically change and open up your horizons
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.400]   in terms of how many things you could do.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   You could spend the next 10 years working something and still have 40 years in front of you.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.480]   So don't think, don't start from the perspective of, "Oh, it's all lost.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.360]   And I'm 48 years old. My husband's 58.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.920]   And we've just haven't saved for retirement.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.280]   And so therefore, we're all doomed."
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   A lot of people think that way.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.600]   I encourage you not to think that way.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.280]   You've got a lot of time and you've got a lot of opportunities in front of you.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.600]   If you think in terms of 50 years and in the next 50 years,
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.080]   what you would imagine your life looking like,
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.920]   you've got to sketch out a future that is exciting to you.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.480]   The most exciting thing to me in what you said is that you've built this career for yourself,
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.400]   that you could do part-time and earn $80,000 per year,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.280]   that you like the work that you do,
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.640]   and you could do it part-time and earn $80,000 per year.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   That is a lot of money to earn from a part-time career.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.880]   That's because you've worked hard, you've gone to school,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.560]   and you've chosen a career that has significant monetary value.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.960]   That means that, especially if the part-time would allow you to do some of the other work
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.880]   that you care about, care deeply about,
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.360]   if it's going to go and work with Doctors Without Borders,
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.280]   if that opens you up to do that,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.120]   if that's compelling to you,
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.000]   then that's going to be a really exciting thing to work towards.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.760]   Now, how do you get there?
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.400]   That's going to be the question.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.120]   Well, you do need to square away a couple of things financially.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.200]   You do want to square away the student loans,
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.480]   and you do want to square away,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.560]   probably you want to square away the mortgage.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:37.680]   Because if you are earning $80,000 and you are debt-free,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.080]   that's going to allow you to feel much more comfortable
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:46.800]   with your volunteering and with your being flexible with your part-time income
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.400]   than if you are feeling like,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.240]   "I only have $10,000 in the bank,
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.400]   and I'm not earning a lot of money, and I got a lot of debt still."
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.160]   So what would I do?
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.760]   I think a few things.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.520]   The house that you're living in,
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.600]   is that the house that you want to be in forever?
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.880]   Is that a forever house?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.000]   Or do you need to change housing?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.960]   Yes, it is.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.640]   No, no, it's the forever.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.040]   Okay.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.760]   So this is a forever house?
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.880]   Like my relationship.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.120]   Good.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.080]   All right.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.440]   So if it's a forever house and it's a forever relationship,
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.160]   then you're in a situation where you got to look forward and say,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.600]   "What makes sense?"
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.200]   Given your income bracket,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.440]   I think contributing to retirement accounts makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.200]   Possibly maxing out retirement accounts makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.600]   Just because it will have a dramatic difference on your impact
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.080]   and on your ability to lower your tax burden.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.280]   And given your age, the fact that your husband is a year and is...
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   I'm blanking on 59 and a half.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.080]   Yeah, he's a year away.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.480]   10 years.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.160]   He's 58, right?
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.000]   Okay.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.440]   So you're 48 and he's 58.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.680]   So that means your husband is a year away from being able to take money
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.720]   out of retirement accounts without any penalties.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.440]   And you are 10 years away from being able to take money
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.760]   out of retirement accounts without any penalties.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:07.200]   Then your flexibility is not reduced very much by contributing to retirement accounts.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.000]   What is the interest rate on your student loans?
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.240]   I've done SoFi because of you.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.160]   So overall, I've got different ones, but it's about 3.5,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.760]   the highest at 3.99 from 8%, by the way.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.240]   Great.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.880]   Awesome.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.440]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.200]   Thank you very much for that, Shaz.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.040]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.280]   SoFi is a student loan that will-- they do other loans as well, the mortgage loans, etc.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.840]   But they have often dramatically cheaper prices that you can use to consolidate your student loans.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.920]   What's the interest rate on your mortgage?
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.360]   3.75.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:45.600]   Great.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.720]   Man, it's hard to tell you to pay down debt aggressively that that's low,
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.360]   that's at those low of an interest rates.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   Now you're putting me in a bind.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.080]   I am.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.040]   I know.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.440]   That's why I'm calling.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.720]   Yeah, you're putting me in a bind.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:15.120]   You can get back with me on that.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.320]   I know you have all the callers.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.480]   No, I've got to-- I need to give you an answer.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.840]   It's just such a hard thing to say.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.120]   I think I would-- if I woke up in your shoes, I would first max my retirement accounts across
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.600]   the board.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.800]   I would keep my expenses as low as possible.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.040]   And I would probably get rid-- oh, man.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.560]   The problem is if you get rid of the student loans, they're not inheritable.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.120]   And you don't have children.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.320]   This is not an easy decision for me.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   So let me just walk it through verbally so that the audience can find if I've got any
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:54.960]   problems.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.360]   Your interest rates on both of your mortgages are both low fixed interest rates, 3.5% and
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.320]   3.75%.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.600]   So low fixed interest mortgage rates.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.080]   Both of the-- you're in a forever house that you're planning to stay in forever.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.160]   There's not a huge benefit for you of paying that off early.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.480]   And with your student loans, even just contrary to what I said earlier where I said I'd get
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.880]   debt free, with your student loans, if those are at a low fixed rate interest, there's
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.240]   not a huge benefit for you in paying those off particularly early either.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.560]   You have a high income.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.360]   And so we want to prioritize the retirement savings.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.680]   You don't have a lot of assets other than your-- potentially what is going to grow to
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.960]   be your retirement accounts.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.440]   And you're going to be having Social Security income and income coming in out of your
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.480]   retirement accounts.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.280]   So even in a worst case scenario, you are basically creditor proof and judgment proof
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.720]   in that situation because Social Security income cannot be attached by your creditors
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.320]   and money that's in your retirement accounts cannot be attached by creditors as well.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:12.560]   So I think if I were in your shoes, I would probably-- and the other reason I'm talking
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.120]   about this is that since you and your husband have no children, then there's not-- we're
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   not worried about any inheritance of the house, nor are we worried about necessarily any
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:29.760]   major problems of passing on assets to children or worried about each other taking care
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.560]   of each other.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.040]   But we're not necessarily worried about assets to children.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:38.640]   So if you have a big student-- all the student loan balance is yours.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.440]   If you die, he doesn't inherit the student loan balance.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.600]   He can sell the house and he doesn't have the mortgage there.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:54.480]   So I don't see a lot of benefit of focusing heavily on getting these loans paid off unless
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.600]   it's a big, big deal to you for some reason.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.960]   So I think, Shaz, here's my answer.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:07.600]   If I were in your shoes-- I feel like Dave Ramsey here because I hate debt, but I have
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.360]   to acknowledge kind of the-- I'm not necessarily as hardcore as he is.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.000]   If I were in your shoes, I think I would prioritize retirement savings.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.360]   And I would focus on doing that as aggressively as possible.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.400]   And I would save as much money, even possibly outside of that as well, to make sure that
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.360]   I had some flexibility and some consistency.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.000]   I would build up a big stash of money in terms of emergency fund.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.080]   I'd try to shoot for something like $100,000.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.800]   If you set aside $100,000 that is available to you, then that'll give you the freedom
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.680]   and the flexibility to start adjusting your work situation.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.040]   You're probably not going to want to travel very much while your mother is alive.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.680]   You'd probably want to wait until she dies to do much more travel.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:58.880]   So this is a really good time to focus on your earnings and working as much as you can.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.240]   I would probably just keep the mortgage payments and the student loan payments at their minimums.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.920]   I'd pay them off as scheduled.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.360]   If you live a long life, that'll work out well for you because the inflation-- you basically
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.440]   have an interest rate that's at the rate of inflation.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.040]   And if you live a short life, if you die prematurely, then that'll work out well for you because
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.760]   you'll be able to leave more money in the 401(k) plan for your husband.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.360]   I would, if I were you, I would buy some term life insurance for you to protect him because
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.040]   his future is tied to your awesome six-figure income.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.360]   I would buy at least a million bucks of term life insurance for you.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.880]   And at 40 years--
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.800]   I do have that.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.120]   Great.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.320]   OK, so just make sure that you have that and that you keep that because that protects him
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.280]   financially in case you die prematurely.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.520]   And then I think I'd just pile off as much extra money as possible, and I would arrange
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.920]   my retirement plans to just factor in my student loan payments and my housing payments.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.160]   And then in the coming years, I would start volunteering and do the volunteer work with
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.120]   the plan of after you have more savings, after you've spent the next three, four, five, six,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.840]   seven years really saving as much as you can, I would adjust and I would start moving towards
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:18.560]   a part-time work arrangement that would allow you to live your retirement lifestyle while
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.840]   living on your earned income.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.480]   If you can do your job from now through 70, that gives you 20 years of savings.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:33.360]   If you max a retirement plan-- let's just do here-- let's just say you're not doing
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.400]   catch-up contributions.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.280]   I'm just going to schedule this at $18,000 a year.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:44.240]   So if you max a retirement plan for 20 years at-- let's just say you get 8% interest starting
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.320]   with nothing-- at the end of 20 years, we're talking a retirement plan balance of about
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.640]   $900,000, almost a million dollars.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:57.920]   If you do catch-up contributions as well of getting you up to the $22,500, that account
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.480]   should easily be in excess of a million, possibly a million and a half dollars, something like
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.120]   that.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.400]   So that way, if you can just plan to work till 70, and if you've got a million and a
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:13.200]   half bucks in retirement plans, and you've got Social Security income, then you'd be
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.520]   in a really, really good situation.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.640]   And then just arrange your work life so that you can continue doing your part-time work
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.040]   at this highly compensated work, and also your part-time work with your volunteer work,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.080]   and then hopefully you can do that for the next 40 years, something like that.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.440]   So I think that's what I would do.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.080]   Is that clear reasons why I said that?
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.600]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.640]   Thank you so much.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.200]   I'm glad you called, because that is not an easy question.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.480]   And I hope I didn't miss anything or get anything wrong there in my approach.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:46.560]   But when you think about it, just somebody who's in the situation like yours, there's
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.600]   a really compelling reason.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.400]   I think that's a compelling scenario.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.920]   So I feel good about that answer.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.840]   Let's go to Grant in New Hampshire.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.680]   Grant, how can I serve you today?
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.320]   Thanks a lot for taking my call, Joshua.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.760]   I really, really appreciate it.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.800]   I'm 48, and I was corporate-drawn up until about a year and a half ago.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.520]   So I was actually the white-collar guy from your podcast that came out today about the
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.080]   401(k).
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.580]   Right.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:17.280]   And I actually left my cushy job because of some extended family health issues about a
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.080]   year and a half ago.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.600]   And that experience kind of opened my eyes, and I decided, hey, I don't want to be in
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.640]   the corporate world anymore, and I want to try this entrepreneurial thing.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.120]   So I'm still working on my business.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.520]   It's not been profitable, but from a tax perspective, last year, that wasn't so bad.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.680]   But doing that, I got into a lot of the entrepreneurial podcasts and books, and that led me to the
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.160]   Side Hustle Nation podcast, which led me to you.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.480]   And then I was like, wait a minute.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.400]   And I really got into the financial, the personal finance hardcore stuff, and I started doing
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.840]   a lot of study on that, listening to tons of your podcasts.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.040]   And I discovered that my family and I were pretty lucky.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.960]   I mean, I kind of accidentally, you know, I've been very frugal my whole life.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.240]   My family's been careful with our money.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:11.120]   I've maxed out 401(k)s, Roth IRAs, all of that, to have some cash and some stock.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.360]   And I've even wondered right now, I'm like, I might be even able to be financially independent
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.440]   now, but that's another story.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.400]   Now, the reason I'm calling is because when I look at my entire portfolio, and I hadn't
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.440]   done this for years.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.360]   I was just doing the corporate thing.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:32.000]   I discovered, and I knew I had this, but I have a one stock that is in my total portfolio
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.680]   that accounts for about 25% of my total portfolio.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.440]   Now, that's a really good thing.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.720]   I mean, I'm very lucky to have it, but I also wonder what I should be doing with this.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.200]   Like, do I sell it off and pay off the house?
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.400]   Do I let it ride?
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.720]   Do I sell it off in little chunks?
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.320]   Because now I'm in this low.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.720]   My wife's working full time now, but we've cut our income by like a third.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.520]   So that's kind of what I'm looking at.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.800]   Like, I do like this kind of low income life we're leading from a tax perspective.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.920]   It seems to be valuable, but my family's not totally comfortable when I talk about early
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.120]   retirement and things like that.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.520]   So I just wanted to get your perspective on all of that stuff.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.000]   - So let's focus on that stock, because that's kind of the core of the message here.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.200]   And it sounds like you're still working through the bigger aspects of the financial plan,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.360]   which we can talk about in a future call.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.880]   This stock, why would you sell it?
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:39.040]   - I would, you know, probably it's the fear it's going to go down is the reason.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:44.480]   You know, it's just, I've held it for so, so long, and it was up very high initially.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.600]   You know, obviously it dropped to nothing, and I'm like, I'm not selling it now.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.120]   It's not worth anything.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.720]   And just by sheer holding onto that stock, it's gone through the roof.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.800]   So part of the reason I've thought about selling it is that, you know, maybe we don't feel
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.680]   comfortable with our expenses versus how much we're right on the edge right now of, you
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.640]   know, we've always been savers before, but now we're on this teetering on this edge of
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.560]   where we're maybe spending a little more than we're bringing in because my business hasn't
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.200]   started going.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.560]   So it's like, hey, maybe I could sell a little bit of it.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.600]   And I have, I will tell you, I sold for the first time a tiny chunk of it to cover, you
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.840]   know, my wife is putting, maxing out her 401(k) at work now, and I just wanted to cover that
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.200]   loss of income.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.960]   So, you know, I'm not sure if I do want to sell.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.760]   I think in some ways, I think like this is a golden egg.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.800]   And sometimes I don't even factor it into the equation because this could just could
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.520]   be the ticket if I just hold on to it.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:57.120]   About what's the, about how much money is the value if you sold it all today, about
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.560]   how much money is the value of this stock?
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.320]   About a quarter of a million.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.720]   If you had a bank account with a quarter of a million dollars in it, and I offered you
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.360]   the opportunity to buy this stock at the current price, would you stroke me a check today?
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.960]   Would I buy that exact stock?
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.600]   At its current price?
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.240]   Yeah, I couldn't do it.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:18.480]   No.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.200]   I mean, I'm waiting, I'm kind of in the way, you know, after listening to you, I'm
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.080]   looking forward to a bottoming out in the market so I can buy some more if it goes down.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.600]   But no, I don't think I, I couldn't pay that much per share price.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.080]   No way.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.800]   So that's probably your answer.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.040]   And that's a good way to think about a lot of things.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.320]   If you're doing something today that you wouldn't do again, if you had the opportunity to do
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.480]   it over again, you probably should quit doing it.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.200]   If you're living in a house that you wouldn't buy again, if you had the opportunity, sell
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.080]   it and move.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.360]   If you're working in a job that you wouldn't, if you had the chance, knowing what you now
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.000]   know, if you had the chance to do it over again, to get that job, you should quit and
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.520]   go find something different.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.360]   And if you own a stock or anything in your life that if you had the chance to do it over
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.560]   again, you wouldn't do, then do it over, then quit and go do it.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.920]   I've been selling my camper van.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.680]   I sold it and then the deal fell apart.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.000]   And so it's sitting in my driveway again right now.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.160]   But I bought the camper van with all these details are profiled in a recent episode,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.600]   probably 40 episodes ago about how to buy a motorhome or RV and not get taken.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.760]   But I bought the camper van very carefully thinking about everything that I wanted.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.960]   I did a ton of research.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.880]   I very carefully chose it.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:42.720]   But after buying it and using it, one of the things that I learned was that I didn't have
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.240]   anywhere inside the camper van to put car seats at night when the beds are made up.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.520]   And I realized that as we add a third child to that camper van, there's just not room
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.480]   for me to be able to handle those car seats.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   So I realized that I needed to make a change.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:06.720]   If I were given the chance to buy that camper van over again, I wouldn't have bought it.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.280]   And so because I wouldn't have bought it over again, I shouldn't keep it just because I've
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.520]   spent money fixing everything up and fixing everything or just because it now has sentimental
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.640]   value or just because I spent all kinds of time researching it.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.520]   It's not right.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.040]   And so I should get out of it.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:28.720]   So if you wouldn't quickly stroke me a check for $250,000 to buy the stock at its current
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.120]   price, then the answer is you should probably sell it.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.280]   And you should probably sell it essentially today.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.760]   Because if you're-- obviously, you're not going to do that.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.680]   But meaning you got to think about it.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.200]   You got to make sure that you're really sure about it.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.120]   But you should sell it as quickly as you can if you wouldn't buy it over again.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.920]   Now, here are the caveats to that which would make the difference.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.160]   Number one, you've owned the stock and you have a significant gain in the stock.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.000]   So therefore, you're going to incur tax.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.560]   That cost needs to be calculated into your decision.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.400]   So you need to calculate the cost of that tax and rework the numbers and ask yourself
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.200]   the question again.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.960]   If I gave you-- if you had whatever the tax burden that's built in, if you had $200,000
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.760]   sitting in a checking account, would you stroke me a check for $200,000 today?
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.440]   Rework the question, understanding the tax implications.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.560]   But if you've dropped to one income and if all of the stock is long-term capital gains
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:33.040]   and you've dropped to one income to where you may be in the lowest capital gains bracket,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:39.200]   check what capital gains tax bracket you're in and see how you would qualify.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.120]   And maybe you should sell all of it.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.720]   Maybe you should sell part of it.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.880]   You do want to make a strategic decision with how you approach it.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.080]   But--
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.000]   - And that's kind of what I did already with the small chunk.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   I thought, you know, just figuring, hey, we're going to end up at this tax bracket where
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.520]   it's going to cost like zero.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.760]   Like, we're not going to pay any capital gain.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.520]   But there may be-- I probably should go back and say, hey, if I sold even more and put
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.400]   us into the 15%-- because this is all-- I've held this for over almost 20 years.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.240]   So it's all-- and it's all profit.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.000]   So yeah, I definitely get what you're saying.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.680]   But, you know, I just, of course, have that seller's remorse.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.480]   Like, if I sold it and I just saw it kept going up and up and up, you know, that's just
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:30.160]   something that, you know, I'm sure that's not totally-- that's not normal.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.720]   But it feels like, oh, I would just be kicking myself when, you know, when my kids are going
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.160]   to college and blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.520]   So I don't know.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.000]   - Right.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.920]   But you don't believe that it's going to go up.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.600]   Because if you did believe that it was going to go up, then you would have said, oh, I've
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.760]   got the chance to buy that for $250,000?
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.960]   Man, I'd stroke a check today.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.840]   - Yeah.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:54.320]   - If I gave you-- if I were offering you a real estate deal and you knew-- you knew
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.320]   that the real estate deal that I was offering you was worth a million dollars, and I said,
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.560]   you've got a chance to buy this today for $250,000, and you knew it was worth a million
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   dollars, you'd stroke that check in a heartbeat.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.240]   - Yeah.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:16.000]   - So don't-- I mean, it's normal to have an emotional attachment to stuff like this.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.600]   But don't let it confuse you as far as, you know, yes, anything can go up.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.560]   Anything can go down.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   But you don't think it's going to go up.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.880]   Otherwise, you wouldn't have answered as quickly as possible.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.400]   Now, if you do think it's going to go up, if you think you've got a good deal and you'd
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.120]   stroke a check for $250,000, then you should keep it.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.520]   And the answer is really as simple as that.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:43.200]   Also, given your considerations in terms of your career changes and things like that,
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.800]   when you are making changes like that, that changes your risk profile.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.320]   And you should adjust your investment portfolio to match.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:59.200]   So if you're in a situation where you are-- where you've-- you are in a situation where
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.440]   you're trying to start a new business, when you were working and earning a high corporate
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.440]   salary, then if your stock moved up, down, et cetera, that probably wasn't a big deal
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.080]   for you.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.400]   You could fairly easily and comfortably make up the difference, and you wouldn't be too
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.280]   worried about it.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:20.480]   But now when you're in this new situation-- now when you're in this new situation where
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.720]   you have the opportunity to start the business, that's going to change your risk profile.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.200]   And because it's changing your risk profile, you should probably consider adjusting your
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.240]   portfolio.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.720]   All right, let's go to Aaron in Massachusetts.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.280]   You're up next.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.400]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.720]   Hi, Josh.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.600]   Big fan of your show.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   Thank you.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:47.440]   My question is, I'm 38 years old, married, two little kids, third one on the way.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.000]   Congratulations.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.640]   My wife and I-- when we lived-- thank you very much.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.960]   When we were living in Massachusetts a couple years ago, we decided to hit the road, travel
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.520]   around the country.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.960]   I'm a registered nurse, and you can take three-month travel assignments.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.360]   So plan was bomb around the country till the kids started school and decide where we want
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.080]   to live.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.520]   Ended up in Northern California, where I got a very high-paying job with a hospital here.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:17.040]   And now our question is, do we stay here, or do we move back to Massachusetts?
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.120]   And we can't figure out a good way to figure out how to make that decision.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.160]   Here, I make about double what I would make in Massachusetts.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:32.240]   It is more expensive to live out here, but not enough that it makes up the difference
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.520]   for the increase in pay.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.800]   Man, Northern California is such a beautiful place.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.400]   Why would you go back to Massachusetts?
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:48.640]   I think the main reason is the feeling of guilt, because my father's stepmother lived
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.120]   there.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.160]   Her parents and sister live in Maine.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   So it's kind of like, oh, we're taking away our kids from our parents, sort of thing.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.680]   And then, oh, I moved to California.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.120]   And then we have lived there for a long time.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.960]   So it does have some-- it feels like home in a way.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.280]   But--
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.240]   That's the main reason.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.360]   Are your parents actively holding that over your head?
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.400]   Is this an active conflict, or is this just a vague feeling that you have?
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.520]   More of a vague feeling.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   Yeah, I think if you--
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.440]   We may have flown out here a couple times, visit the kids, and then we're going to fly
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.520]   back in September, stay for a couple weeks.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:33.760]   But we're close, but not-- everybody's not super, super close.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.440]   If you survey family, there are some people who would say, man, I really want to live
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.480]   next door to my parents and the kids' grandparents.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.080]   There's some people who would say, California to Massachusetts is an ideal distance.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.640]   We can see each other once every couple of years, and it works out well.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.800]   And I think there are considerations.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.360]   Sometimes it's an advantage to live close to family.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.160]   Sometimes it's a disadvantage to move close to family.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.840]   But I wouldn't-- if it's just a vague feeling, I wouldn't do a lot with that.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:10.560]   There are all kinds of alternative ways to adjust the situation in a way that would fit
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.440]   better in terms of possibly-- maybe they're going to move to California.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.680]   Maybe there's a state closer that they want to move to Nevada or something like that.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.200]   Or there are all kinds of different approaches of things that can be done.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.360]   And if you're making double in California what you would be in Massachusetts, there
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.080]   should be some extra money to pay for plane tickets from time to time that could be valuable.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:39.120]   Also, there are plenty of ways-- sometimes if you live far away from somebody, you can
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.960]   send the kids for a few weeks during the summer.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.160]   It could be a nice break for you and a nice break for the parents.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.640]   There are lots of ways that things could be adjusted.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.120]   Do you have any other compelling reason to go to Massachusetts?
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.880]   No, not really.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.520]   Well, in absence of a compelling reason to move, I don't see much functional difference
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.280]   between California and Massachusetts with regard to anything financial.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.800]   They're both high tax, high cost of living states to some degree.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.360]   But Northern California is different than Southern California, lower cost of living.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:18.000]   And as long as you've calculated the tax burden and calculated its impact on your life,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.200]   then I don't see any reason to go.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.400]   If you were saying I should go to California and move to Texas, then it would be a financial
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:26.960]   calculation.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.440]   But I don't hear you asking any financial question.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.880]   So I don't see any reason to leave.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.480]   I don't think-- yeah, part of it was I didn't want to make-- and I can't tell in my mind--
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:46.160]   a decision solely based off of finances as far as overall life planning goes.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.560]   Like here, I get-- if the pension stays-- like if I stayed out here, I get a pension
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.960]   at the end of the 20 years.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.040]   I don't in Massachusetts.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.200]   And then I make more money now so I can stay home more with the kids.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.720]   And I was like, eh, you know, just try not to get stuck in the golden handcuffs sort
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.680]   of thing as far as reasoning goes.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.760]   But my initial-- our initial thought pattern was pretty much what you said.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.800]   Well, I can have enough money to pay for tickets and fly back.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.300]   [LAUGHS]
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.240]   - Yeah.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.560]   I think you don't start with finance.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.000]   You build ideal lifestyle.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.240]   But finance is a component of that.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   And Northern California is a beautiful and tremendous place.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.840]   So I could see a lot of benefits of it.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.640]   In absence of a compelling reason to change, I think you keep doing what's been-- you keep
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.920]   doing what's been working for you and keep going with it.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.320]   All right.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.080]   Mike in Colorado, you're up next.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.200]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.160]   - Hi, Joshua.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.680]   A longtime patron.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.720]   My question is, how can I tell if it'd be beneficial to start some sort of tax advantage
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.840]   plan leaning toward maybe a 401(k) with or without profit sharing for a small business
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.440]   versus just taking the extra money and investing it in an after-tax brokerage account?
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.520]   Just a little history.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.240]   We used to have a 401(k) in this company, apparently, like seven years ago before I
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.720]   was there, but they dissolved it when they felt like they were getting ripped off with
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.760]   extra fees and just not great options where they were investing.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.600]   And so they dissolved it before I got there.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.880]   But I'm kind of looking at maybe trying to get something going again here.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.240]   We have like five doctors, 40 employees.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:44.560]   So one consideration is the non-discrimination testing that we'll have to do and the matching
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.880]   that we have to do, profit sharing.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.000]   So I'm kind of staring down 40 years old and haven't saved much for retirement, and we're
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.920]   all kind of in the highest tax bracket.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.400]   So yeah, what are your thoughts?
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.840]   - Are your employees asking for it?
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.000]   - No, not at all.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.600]   In fact, I think if we did do like the matching and stuff, I think a lot of them would not
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.000]   do it.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:16.000]   - And are your fellow physicians, there are a total of five owners and you have an ownership
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.960]   stake in the firm?
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.040]   - Yeah, 20%.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.600]   We're all 20%.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.840]   - And are the other physicians looking for something, trying to figure out how to establish
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.640]   some kind of plan?
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.560]   - Not really.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.360]   Well, I think one of them is definitely.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.040]   One of them's on the fence.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.480]   One of them puts all his money in like a whole life plans and stuff.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.080]   And so he's resistant.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   And one of them's also kind of on the fence.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.800]   And so, I mean, it's gonna come down to a vote.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.880]   I gotta get three to two.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.320]   So part of it, I need to present in a smart way, like, hey, mathematically, here we go.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.520]   But yeah, that's kind of my burden here.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.000]   From me looking at it, I feel like it probably makes sense.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.120]   And I did have like a fee-based advisor look at it and said he thinks it makes sense.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:15.520]   Part of it comes down to whether you pay the tax, it goes to the government versus the
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.880]   money would go to your employees.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.120]   I'd rather benefit my employees than the government.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.840]   - Of course.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.440]   - But yeah.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.360]   - I think you need a consultant.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.800]   This is one where you need to calculate the numbers because instituting a plan is not
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.280]   free.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.120]   It's not free to run the plan.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.800]   There'll be administrative fees, third-party administrator fees, et cetera.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.080]   And it's not free to start to establish the profit sharing, the employer matching.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.960]   If your employees are not clamoring for it, that means you may have some problems with
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.080]   the participation rate.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:54.400]   So you'll need to make sure that either you may be doing a safe harbor plan, which is
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.560]   gonna, you have to calculate those costs.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   You need to get some actual numbers here.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:05.360]   Then you need to calculate in your own situation what the optimal advantage is and calculate,
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.520]   okay, if I have this plan just for me, just thinking selfishly and I contribute to it,
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:17.840]   how much is that actually going to save me in terms of taxation?
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:24.400]   And you have to focus on the fact that putting money in a 401(k) doesn't mean that you're
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.600]   never gonna pay tax.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.600]   So mentally, you're gonna pay tax at some point.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.840]   You're just gonna pay it in the future.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.000]   And so it's not 100% savings.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.920]   It's not as though, okay, if I contribute $20,000, I'm getting this massive savings.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.600]   You're getting some savings, but you're gonna pay the tax at some point.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   - Yeah, I definitely think there'll be an arbitrage 'cause I won't make as much, maybe,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.920]   in retirement.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.480]   - Agreed, agreed.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.040]   - At this rate now.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:49.920]   - Right.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:56.880]   I don't believe, I don't see how it's possible for people who are contributing and employees
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.360]   saving for retirement in the traditional way, I don't see how it's possible for them to
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:07.120]   have a higher income in retirement than during their working years.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.880]   The only exception to that would be people who sell large businesses.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.120]   But for the average person, you're gonna have a lower income.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.680]   So yes, it would be an arbitrage opportunity.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:21.120]   My point is, if you calculate the actual cost, every year that you pay the TPA fees, every
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.200]   year that you make those contributions for your employees, that's money that you're not
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.720]   gonna get in actual profit for yourself.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.560]   So that's 100% money that's gone.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:39.920]   If it's saving you an arbitrage of, say, 15%, 10% or 15% on your tax rates, then calculate
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.040]   what that number is and compare that to the cost of putting the plan in.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:50.080]   My guess is it probably wouldn't make that big of an impact on your financial life.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.440]   And if your employees aren't clamoring for it, and if your fellow physicians aren't sure
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.240]   that they want it, it's probably not something I would pursue super aggressively.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:00.880]   Now, I'm guessing.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.000]   I haven't done any of that math.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.360]   You need to do the math.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.040]   But I'm just guessing.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:14.640]   The biggest reason to put in place a profit-sharing plan and choosing one with 401(k) benefits
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.040]   is as a way of enhancing the compensation package for your employees.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.360]   That should be your primary reason, because you're gonna pay money for it.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:30.560]   So if it's not helpful to your employees in terms of an extra benefit that they really
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:35.120]   want, that they're gonna value, if it's not gonna reduce employee turnover, if it's not
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.680]   gonna put those golden handcuffs on their wrists, my guess is it's gonna cost you more
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.040]   than it saves you personally.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.640]   That would be my guess.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.240]   But you need to get math.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.480]   You need to get a couple of proposals from a local employee benefits consultant with
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.120]   the cost baked in, have them look, calculate the cost of doing Safe Harbor and things like
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:58.720]   that, and then compare that with your tax accountants to see how much you could potentially
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.840]   save by participating.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:05.280]   Yeah, that's my biggest challenge has been finding someone that's impartial that can
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.000]   give me, just run the math for me.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.600]   Because it gets very complex.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.760]   Some of these things, the fees you're paying pre-tax, some of these fees are pre-tax,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.400]   and some of these.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.280]   And so it's just, it is extremely complex question.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.160]   Call a couple of local financial advisors, tell them you're looking for a specialist,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.840]   call some of the big firms, call a couple of the big wire houses, and call a couple
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.080]   of the big insurance companies.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:36.160]   So call a, just have your staff do it.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.520]   Just call a couple of the firms and tell them, I'd like to talk to somebody in employee
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.240]   benefits and get a referral.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.280]   You'll be able to get a referral to somebody and they will come in and you get a few possible
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.600]   referrals and they'll make some suggestions for you and they'll give you a breakdown
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.120]   of the prices.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.440]   And it won't cost you to have them quote you out a proposal and that'll give you better
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.640]   data to at least decide.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.760]   Now, whether or not any of them does a good enough job that they deserve the business,
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.800]   that's up to you.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.160]   But at least you'll have an idea of whether it's something you should pursue heavily or
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:08.400]   not.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:08.900]   Okay.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.280]   That's where I would start.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.040]   Yeah, I'll keep going on this and see what we come up with.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.800]   But I appreciate your thoughts on it.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.600]   Absolutely.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.200]   It's definitely not an easy decision.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:26.240]   There is, I think employees often don't realize the costs that employers face when it comes
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.880]   to what they need to do and what they don't need to do and how much that they're actually
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.560]   going to pay for all of these decisions.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.880]   All right, Andy in California, you are up.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.000]   Our last caller.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.960]   Go ahead and shoot, sir.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.720]   Let me know how I can serve you today, please.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.400]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.400]   I am a huge fan of both your podcasts.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.520]   So thanks for taking my call.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.020]   Thank you.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.280]   Background for me, I'm 31.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.840]   I work in the government school system and based on my current income, I'd receive about
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.200]   $120,000 a year for life beginning at age 62.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.840]   So obviously it's a large amount, but it's also three decades away.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.120]   It's a long time for politicians potentially change the rules of the pension system.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.040]   And so I just am trying to figure out how you would recommend I account for it in my
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.400]   long-term wealth planning or retirement planning.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.520]   If I act like it's going to be there and it's not, then obviously I have a huge gap.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   But one of the reasons that one of the benefits of working in a government system is the promised
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.080]   pension.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:31.200]   So if I take a lower salary than the private sector may offer and I have to still save
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.000]   retirement the same way, then there's obviously challenges there as well.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:46.720]   If the retirement pension works as advertised, are you thrilled with the job?
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.480]   Are you thrilled with the work?
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.680]   Are you thrilled with the prospect of serving out your career in this area for the next
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.180]   30 years?
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.840]   Absolutely.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.920]   I'm absolutely passionate about my job.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.420]   Okay.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:07.600]   I think that should be the primary thing because a lot of the math, it's such a crapshoot.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.520]   I mean, how do you know?
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.160]   It's really hard to know.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.720]   So would this be the CalPERS pension in California?
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.220]   That's correct.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.400]   Exactly.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.760]   Do you know anything about the financial strength of that pension program?
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.440]   I believe they're currently about 77% funded and the employer contribution requirement
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:38.720]   has gone from 10% as of two years ago of one's compensation to right now it's about 14% and
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.520]   they just released data that it'll go up to an employer match of employer contribution
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.240]   of 28% by 2021.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.680]   So they're requiring employers pay a lot more into the system.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.640]   It's not an area of my expertise.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.720]   You have researched it and started researching it.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.760]   I would follow your instinct.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:08.560]   Search out the opinions, search out the harshest critics you can find of the California pension
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.440]   system.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.560]   Try to find what the harshest critics say and then try to find what the biggest promoters
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.400]   say and then study the actual numbers.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.320]   This is a guess, not having done that research.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:31.520]   My guess is that it's probably going to be pretty safe.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:36.160]   In terms of there's a big difference between a city pension, in my mind, there's a big
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   difference between a local city pension versus a state pension and there's a big difference
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.640]   between the state of California and many other states.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:51.440]   So California has a massive economy and what the future of that economy is, what the future
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.760]   of these things is, it's hard to say.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.800]   But if you are a government employee in the state of California, you are part of a very
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.280]   respected and honored voting bloc.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:08.960]   You have a much stronger position as a part of that voting bloc than you do in many other
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.680]   states where government employees are not valued quite so highly, politically speaking
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.040]   and ideologically speaking.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.400]   Also, the CalPERS pension system is huge.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.840]   It's absolutely huge.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.360]   So if it doesn't work out, you're in with a lot of other people.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.080]   You're in trouble with a lot of other people.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.800]   I think what I would do is I would focus first and foremost on the career.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.720]   And if it's a career that you're going to be thrilled with, I would stick with that.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:42.400]   Because even if it's 80%, 70%, it's my guess that I don't see any way that, given the
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.080]   demographics, given things, I don't see any way that a lot of these long-term pensions
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.040]   aren't going to take a slight haircut at least.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.480]   But I don't think it'll be zero.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:55.200]   So if you're thrilled with a career for another 30 years and then you retire and let's say
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.680]   what they're saying to you is going to be $120,000, but it's actually $100,000, I think
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.360]   you'd be pretty happy in that circumstance.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.520]   Great.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.000]   Well, thank you.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.040]   I do have one more question.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:07.920]   Is it possible for me to ask that?
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:08.400]   Sure, go for it.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:08.960]   Yep, go ahead.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.280]   Interesting, perhaps, arbitrage opportunity with student loan debt.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.880]   So unfortunately, I do have a lot of student loan debt in excess of $200,000.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:27.040]   I'm repaying it under an income-based program, which requires I pay 10% of my discretionary
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.240]   income to the student loan.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.200]   And because I work in education, after 10 years of payments, they forgive the loan in
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.400]   a non-taxable event.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.040]   And I've worked for four years, so I'm six years away from that.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.480]   The way they calculate that payment is it's based off of your adjusted gross income and
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.800]   then some other complex calculations from there.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:53.280]   But given that's off your adjusted gross, payments into a 403(b) or 457 would not be
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   calculated for the loan repayment.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.240]   So in essence, every $10 that goes into a retirement vehicle or tax-deferred retirement
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.760]   vehicle would be saving me $1 in student loan repayment.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:09.920]   And so I know that in general, you question the appropriateness of contributions to retirement
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:15.120]   accounts because of some of the restrictions and the limits on the types of investments
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.760]   that can be made.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.320]   But I want to know if under this situation, you would think that for at least the next
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.120]   six years, that I should stash as much as I can into that.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.440]   Because worst-case scenario, if I need the money after the loan's been forgiven, and
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:32.400]   I have the 10% early withdrawal fee, it's really just the same as the 10% I would have
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.600]   had going towards the student loan.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.340]   Yes.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.340]   I would.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.460]   I would.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.480]   I would put as much.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:38.980]   I would.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.480]   Obviously, you got to live.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.520]   But given that opportunity with such a massive student loan and given the fact that it's
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:51.840]   on schedule to be forgiven in six years, I would max out those retirement accounts, no
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.640]   question.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:58.240]   Go back and listen to the show that I did on even how investing in, even if you have
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.760]   to take, when I did the math on taking early withdrawals, even if you pay the penalty of
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:10.320]   how that's still superior to contributing after tax, go back and listen to that show
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.360]   if you missed it.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:18.800]   And when you take that plus the student loan arbitrage opportunity, I think that is definitely
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.840]   the decision that I would make.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.200]   I would put as much.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.080]   I would seek to get every dollar into those retirement accounts at this stage that I possibly
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:26.640]   could get.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:32.880]   And also given your first question that you asked, I think that moves you.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:38.320]   That helps you as well in case of problems with your pension to where you additionally
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.800]   have some savings.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   So even if you don't do this forever, even if you do this as a strategy, something along
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:50.000]   the lines of for the next six years, we're just going to live on very little.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.400]   But we're going to put everything into these retirement accounts.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.920]   If you have young children, then that'll probably – six years from now, it would
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.960]   probably be an ideal time to start spending more money on them.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.080]   Then go ahead and feel free after the student loans are forgiven.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.520]   Go ahead and just reduce your retirement account contributions.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.960]   And so on multiple levels, I see that as being a good plan.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:16.240]   Saves you money on student loan interest and payments because of the debt forgiveness,
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.080]   allows you to set aside money that will be there for retirement.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:24.880]   And even if you need to take it out before retirement, you would still be better off
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.520]   by using those retirement accounts than you would otherwise.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.120]   So I'll look up that show.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.040]   I don't remember the title of the show that I'm referencing.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.080]   But I'll look that up and put it in the show notes for other listeners.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.400]   But it was a show where I calculated how it's still superior.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:43.280]   If you're going to take money out for early retirement, even if you're going to pay
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.840]   the penalty, you still should use a retirement account if you have access to a good one.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.640]   Terrific.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.400]   Thanks for calling in, man.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.640]   What a great situation.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.440]   And work hard.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.800]   You're in the middle of an important job.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.840]   And if you like it and you work well in the government school system there, then I wish
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.920]   you all the best.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.840]   I seriously considered being a government school teacher myself.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.080]   I thought it would be really, really great.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.120]   I love to teach.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.920]   I love to teach young men and women and children.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.880]   I'm not a teacher.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.680]   I'm a teacher.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.720]   I love to teach young men and women and children.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.120]   I'm not an elementary school guy, but I would love to do high school.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:26.000]   If I could teach high school history, that'd be a dream career for me.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.040]   So I love to teach.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:33.760]   And when you get all the benefits of the teaching system, if you can earn a good wage, and that
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   depends on school district, but if you find a school district that can pay you a good
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:43.360]   wage, you get summers off, you get work that's constrained exclusively to basically the classroom
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:43.920]   hours.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:49.040]   You can do some other things, but my experience has been that if a teacher really, really
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.040]   focuses, a lot can be done during the school hours in terms of the grading requirements
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.560]   and things like that.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:55:00.160]   You start putting these things together, it's a tremendous early retirement career in my
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:00.880]   opinion.
