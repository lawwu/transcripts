[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.140]   Do it and just hadn't gotten it done and hadn't gotten it done and hadn't gotten it done
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.280]   And finally I was able to sit down with him
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.600]   actually just today we sat down just before lunch and I brought the microphones over to his house here on Palm Beach and
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.400]   Set them up on on a table and card table there and and sat down and recorded this interview that you're just about to hear
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.800]   With him. In fact, you'll even hear right at the end of the interview. You'll hear his wife calling us to lunch
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.740]   That's to come and eat. She was making us wrap up on time. I had a great interview. Andy sage is a remarkable man
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.060]   He's 90 years old and he built his career. He started in the bottom of the trenches right after World War two
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.920]   Well trenches meaning the I don't know if he was in the physical trenches or not
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.960]   But the metaphorical trenches on Wall Street worked his way up and eventually left Lehman after serving as the president and CEO
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.040]   You'll hear a little bit of that story today and since then has gone on to live just a really fascinating life
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.240]   he's the kind of guy that I love to spend time with because he's the kind of guy who really just
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.360]   Exudes a love of life and a vigor and a vitality looks and looks and acts like a man far younger than his years
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.200]   It's fantastic to see so today
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.160]   I'm gonna share that with you share his story with you and just sit back and listen
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.800]   Listen from those who have gone before and listen to what they've done and what they did
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.740]   Well on their their journey before I play the interview though sponsor of the day
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.400]   Number one today is Paladin registry if you're looking for a financial advisor
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.640]   It's hard to know where to start you can start by collecting some referrals from your friends
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.480]   I think that's a great idea if you have a friend of yours that has a great financial advisor
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.360]   They constantly talk about it's great to start there
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.940]   You can start by looking around and seeing who's near to you or look in your local community. Those are great ways to start as well
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.120]   But what if you don't have those options or what if you want to have a second or third opinion when you're hiring a financial?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.200]   Advisor, you probably shouldn't just take the first one that comes in the door
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.340]   Never really understood why people don't interview multiple advisors and get multiple opinions, you know, we do it with doctors
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.340]   We do it with dentists. We do it with
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.000]   plumbers
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Why wouldn't you do it with financial advisors?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.620]   well
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.240]   that's where Paladin registry comes in Paladin registry is a registry service that gives you the opportunity to sit down and
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.080]   talk to multiple financial advisors who have been pre screened and
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.800]   Pre-vetted to make sure that their business practices and their just their business practice are in line with with
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.520]   With our above board their ethical complaints no ethical complaints, etc
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.080]   Paladin was started by a man named Jack Waymire who was a financial advisor and he was frustrated with the fact that there wasn't
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.000]   A vetting process or excuse me. I should say an extreme vetting process. There wasn't an extreme vetting process out there
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So he decided to start it
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.020]   So he began Paladin registry if you're looking for financial advisor start your search at radical personal finance comm slash Paladin pal

[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.160]   Keeps me on track helps me to allocate the money that I need
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.440]   To allocate towards the future towards future goals big problem with most budgeting
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.560]   Software packages is they only look to the past. They only look back and track what's happened in the past
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.000]   Why now doesn't do that? I mean it does do that
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.040]   It tracks that what's happened in the past, but more importantly it allows you to allocate the money that's in your checking account right now
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.720]   Question does every dollar in your checking account right now have a name on it already?

[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   And I thought it would really be a great opportunity for you to share that with my listeners
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.080]   Because you've you've worked the the halls of business and you've learned a lot of lessons along the way
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.120]   So I'd love for you just to kind of share the story. Where did you begin and how did you get involved in the business world?
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.040]   well, I
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   It all begins
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.160]   Back when I went to school
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.000]   Got an early start in school, but the trouble is
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.160]   through carelessness primarily my parents sent me to three years of
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.640]   kindergarten
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.480]   By the time I got into school. I was already behind a couple of years
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:12.280]   And things didn't go so well even then and along the line we lost another year
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.360]   Finally I'm 18 years old and I'm in what I guess would be
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   My
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.160]   I'm in my 10th grade. It's not very good
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.480]   The war came along
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   And I turned 18
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.120]   This would have been a World War two in World War two and off I went that was that was in 19
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.320]   Early 44. So you were born in 19?
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.840]   26 26 so
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.480]   I in this in the army or in the air air Corps, which
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   then was part of the army I
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.600]   did get schooling in electronics radio radar and
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.480]   became a radar mechanic and
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:11.280]   Things went very well in that school as compared to the disastrous earlier stuff get out of the
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   out of the army in
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.160]   1946 and
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.880]   Got a job on Wall Street and
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.120]   As a clerk in a
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.840]   small specialized brokerage firm
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.560]   My work was purely mechanical
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.600]   for the
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.880]   It was there about a year and a half and that for the last half I was on the floor of the Stock Exchange
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.680]   and
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.840]   then I went to work for my father who was a broker a
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   specialist on the floor of the Stock Exchange and I did that and
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.880]   in
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.360]   1947
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.800]   the the volume in the Stock Exchange in those
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.000]   Cold hard years was about one to one and a half million shares a day
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.180]   What there is now in the first nanosecond
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:13.720]   It was boring and I wasn't needed and I learned a lot about playing pranks on other people working on the floor
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.440]   No such foolishness
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.560]   but
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.640]   Not no useful experience. I
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.080]   quit and
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.840]   Was thinking of going to California to work in the Redwoods
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.680]   Where my family had some?
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.040]   timber
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.320]   That had been in the family for a couple of generations and it might have needed some attention. I
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:45.120]   Knew a partner at Lehman's from having lunch occasionally and he invited me to come down there
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.280]   He asked me if I what I was doing. I told him nothing
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   He asked me if I would come down and talk to him. I didn't want to go back to Wall Street
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   It was boring. I didn't like it
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.000]   But I couldn't really say no after I told him that I had nothing to do. So down I went and
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.080]   He paid me $50 a week to go to work for Lehman Brothers
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.840]   Which began a
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   25 or more years
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.800]   Career
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.520]   during which time I did a little bit of everything and
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:28.000]   So it at the end was president CEO and
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.080]   And the first managing partner
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:40.400]   Which I did for two or three years and then I'd had enough of Wall Street
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.600]   left it moved to Wyoming got a ranch and
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.880]   Continued to do work for Lehman's
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   Continued to do other financial work mostly fix-ups and I worked on
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.960]   Trying to repair broken-down companies
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.760]   for the rest of my business
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.340]   Generation I'd never really quit but
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   Most of my work came directly or indirectly from banks
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.880]   who had loans that weren't getting repaid and
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.600]   gradually all the people that I knew
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.000]   In the banks and
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.120]   elsewhere retired and
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.960]   in the end early
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.360]   Phone stopped ringing the fix-up stopped coming in
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.200]   I didn't have an appetite for getting buying any any more of them myself
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.000]   and so
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.360]   Ended up in a sort of a retirement it tapered off
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.160]   I wasn't interested in being on the road five days a week almost every week of the year
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:56.360]   which I had been and so now I really am in a position of being a very passive investor and
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.760]   Passing my time of day doing other kinds of things
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.600]   So this term fix-ups is not a really a common term. What does that mean?
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.120]   Well
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   it means that
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   companies
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.120]   get into trouble and
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.560]   Pay a price
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.320]   Companies fall into a number of different categories
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.080]   But the most common one involves companies that have borrowed money and can't repay it
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:37.320]   When they can't repay long enough the banks get angry
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.880]   and
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.400]   upset and
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.240]   Seek a solution, but the solution isn't easy
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.680]   First there are bankruptcy laws that protect companies
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.360]   who are
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.640]   people money particularly banks and
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.240]   Protect them very successfully. So the bank has got a risk of never seeing their money
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.960]   and
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.520]   Usually the companies are being badly managed
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:12.960]   Not in every case, but in most cases the companies are being badly managed and the banks don't quite know what to do about it
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.640]   And that's where a fix-up is required and there are people
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.480]   Of which I was one
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.520]   That I did but by myself and in partnership with others where we go in and try to help them
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.840]   Square away their problems, which usually are not complicated and get on the right track
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.320]   And the the lenders either get their money or partial part of their money
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:45.400]   Sometimes they don't and that's that's what I call a fix-up
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.680]   It fix up is where somebody calls and says hey
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.320]   we own a big hunk of this company or the company owes us money or we're partners with them or whatever and
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.520]   They're being badly run
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:04.000]   We'd like you to go in and see what you can do to make it work and you go in and you're usually welcomed
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   And you usually find out that
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.720]   There's lots of things that can be done and there are lots of people there that know how to do it
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.800]   They just don't happen to be the people who are running it at the time
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.560]   Sometimes even the people that are running it at a time are very good, but they're just not good at
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.240]   General management, they're good at their work. One of the things that you learn early on is
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.800]   In most of these is that the person who was at the helm of these companies?
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:42.440]   must go and they must be seen to go you must fire them and
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.720]   If you don't you'll have no credibility
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:53.280]   Whatever and I've had that come up a number of times and I learned that lesson the hard way in one case
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.880]   The case of a company that I'm still involved with
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.080]   The guy who ran it was really pretty good. He was a management consultant
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.720]   He'd gotten over his head in managing it as a business, but he had technical knowledge. It was very good. I
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.880]   kept him on and
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.240]   Not in the top position, but I kept him on
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.160]   useful in the company and
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.440]   we were just
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.280]   Couldn't get the lenders to be reasonable and finally one of them took me aside and said, you know
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.160]   Until somebody gets punished for what happened to us
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.240]   We're just not going to be very cooperative. We're not going to really believe
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.960]   so what you really have to do is
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:45.600]   You have to fire that person and you have to he has to be seen to have been fired for you to become credible
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.000]   We're so unfortunate guy wasn't much good. Anyway, and
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.260]   He had to go and and things opened up
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:59.200]   these are the things you find when you get in you also find that the the
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.600]   really tough ones are the giant companies and
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.000]   International Harvester is an example of
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.680]   One place that I went and this company was in incredible amounts of trouble
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.920]   For reasons that were really obvious. They continued to operate in businesses where they were unprofitable
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.400]   And with no real justification for doing so
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.360]   and
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.600]   There were lots of people there that knew well what ought to happen
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.640]   But it wasn't being run by the people that were doing the right things. So
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.320]   Often you get there and you find it
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:44.680]   The solutions are not very complex the problem with giant companies and International Harvester was a giant company
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.000]   is that they can operate inefficiently and
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   extremely inefficiently and extremely
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   Unprofitable for a long time before the wolf comes to the door and starts to eat them
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.640]   Their very size gives them
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.120]   Repute and cash
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.040]   Reserves that allow them to make mistakes for long periods of time
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.680]   I owned a little company at the same time. I went there
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.920]   In Pennsylvania making filters, it was a very small company
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.640]   we had sales of a couple of million dollars a year if that and
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.200]   We it was a bit of a struggle at first too
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:34.840]   But if in that company if we did anything very wrong in March
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.640]   By early May we would have been bankrupt
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:45.760]   You did we did we did just wouldn't have had the time with a small operation to operate in efficiently
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.200]   which you have in the giant companies is a
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:55.080]   Ship moving through the water that weighs a million tons and it goes on through the water
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.920]   And it's very heavy water for a long time before it sinks. It does sink in the end
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.720]   Harvester didn't most of the ones that I went survived
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.440]   To varying degrees of success
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.120]   But this is the business I got into and I got into it
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.560]   not only myself but with other partners who did the same kind of thing and
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.160]   It was a it was fun work
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.920]   to a point and
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.520]   It was for me very good work because it had an end
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.000]   I'm not a person who wanted to go to work and that's why I didn't want to stay at Lehman's
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.960]   After a while because it is that as that when I began to running the place
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.800]   It wasn't nearly as much fun as doing the things I was doing earlier, and I was being beaten on by
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.760]   God knows how many partners
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.800]   About one who didn't get as much of a bonus as the one the year before and why did this kind of stuff?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.680]   was
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   boring and
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:03.160]   Unsatisfying and very much tying you down to a nine-to-five type of life
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.520]   and
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.680]   That really wasn't for me. The fix-ups are good. You go in you do what you have to do and you get out
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.600]   You're greeted
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.760]   Happily when you arrive because everybody's in trouble
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.240]   You're detested by the time they're profitable and it's working
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.560]   They can't wait to see the last of you and out you go with a nice paycheck
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.640]   For your for your work. It's a good way to go
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.960]   At least you don't have any regrets and say go maybe I should stay around longer
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.640]   No, I never wanted to stay around
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.800]   I never wanted to stay around longer and they didn't want to be reminded of what they had been
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.480]   and
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.240]   my contribution
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.280]   In some cases was really fairly major in others. It was really very minor it
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.040]   in the case of one company
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.720]   I
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:59.960]   Didn't accomplish much except for persuading the board that they should not file chapter 11 with that company
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.120]   Because it would be disastrous and I don't know that I personally did much more
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.960]   That was my main contribution was keeping them from filing
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:17.600]   Until they were able to survive. I didn't have to do very much physical work in others
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   I really had to get in and
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.920]   right on the right on the right in the line of work and
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.760]   Do jobs always I had to travel always I had to rent apartments or wherever it is because
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:39.160]   No companies that get in this kind of trouble obliged me by being next door where I could drive to them
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.000]   And that's so that that period had to end also
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.680]   How do they calculate compensation for somebody like this for doing a job like that? Is it based on a contract?
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.520]   Is it based on performance? How do you figure that out in various various ways?
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.480]   One typical way was
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.720]   that a
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:06.000]   Number of the businesses were businesses that came out of Lehman Brothers where I was I still stayed involved with Lehman Brothers
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.440]   Even though I stopped going to work every day
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:16.040]   And so a lot of the stuff came from Lehman Brothers and I was doing that while being paid to do it by by Lehman's
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.120]   In lots of them I became
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.680]   most of them really I
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.520]   Was on the board and involved in the companies themselves
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.880]   With or without Lehman's and in which case I was compensated by the
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.280]   By the company that I was working for
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:43.320]   Those were and the last case is that in some cases
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.000]   One in particular that still survives I
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:56.800]   Became an owner of the company that I went in to start fixing and my compensation ceased
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.680]   Because I didn't couldn't afford to pay myself out of a out of a failing company
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.880]   but the compensation came in in getting rid of the things that didn't work and
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.960]   Making something of the things that did work. And in the end the compensation in that was just a compensation of ownership
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.200]   All right. All right. So you had a little bit of probably some more things
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.560]   I haven't even thought of
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.640]   When you were at Lehman you began it sounds like you said you started earning $50 a week at a very low-level
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.800]   Position and when you left you were a CEO and president
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:35.680]   What types of work did you do over the course of your 25 years there and how did it progress
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.440]   Where you were able to go from entry-level to top management?
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.440]   Well, I went to entry-level I
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.720]   Went to entry-level
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.880]   It's true and I had been in the street for a year and a half on the on the stock exchange
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.440]   We should lend some sort of
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.880]   Credibility though in hindsight the credibility was worthless
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.520]   I
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.160]   Started by going from department to department as a trainee and
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:18.980]   Eventually I got into what we call the industrial department, which was a corporate finance department and it's
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.440]   Work there was to
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:29.080]   write memoranda and prepare work for the partners of the firm to go and deal with the companies
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.560]   RCA and other companies that were
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.160]   Clients and mind you the clients of an investment banking firm
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:45.840]   Use you when they want to raise money by selling stocks by selling bonds or or something in between
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.920]   so your
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.720]   Limits is a financing company and you doing financing work and I did
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.200]   Work in the trenches for about seven years
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.920]   writing memos for people to carry to their clients and
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.680]   then I
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.880]   Moved into a different section
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.080]   Which was called the syndicate the syndicate is the part of Lehman Brothers that?
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.800]   That forms a group of brokerage firms and in smaller investment banking firms and big ones
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.280]   around the country to sell
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.440]   stocks and bonds in wholesale amounts
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.720]   So you had to have contacts daily contacts with 80 or 90?
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.520]   firms that become part of your syndicate as you put them together to do an offering of
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:45.040]   Corporate securities and I ran that for a number of years and gradually got more into management
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.360]   And less into doing
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:55.000]   The actual work I had clients by then of my own and I was on some boards and
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.360]   I
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:04.640]   Ended up in management not because I wanted to be but because one day Lehman Brothers woke up and
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.400]   Found the back office found that it was unable to identify
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.320]   400 million dollars of securities that they had on hand in their vaults and
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.960]   That they were unable to find
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.840]   $200,000,000 of securities that other people were claiming we had and we couldn't find
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.720]   And this mess ended up with an SEC
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:36.600]   intervention and censure and the firm was in real trouble our
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.440]   computers were a system and
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.520]   a product of a company who was our client
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:53.040]   It was chosen by Lehman Brothers only because it was a client not because it was a particularly good computers
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.360]   Which it didn't and it brought with it a workforce
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.920]   Which were equally ineffective?
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:06.080]   We have the problem we got into of not being able to find securities or having too many
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:14.360]   Stem from moving from a bookkeeping pen and ink business to a computer business. The computer business was an utter disaster
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   somebody had to do something about it and
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:26.480]   Really all the people at Lehman's were financiers and know anything about this kind of thing and I grabbed them
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   Grab the handle of this problem just because I had to I took a short course
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.240]   Given by Harvard Business School, I think
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:43.560]   But not in Massachusetts in New Jersey somewhere in computers and then got rid of the RCA's
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.840]   got IBM computers got rid of all the people that we had in that area got new people and
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:59.280]   And had I think a hundred people temporary people from an accounting firm just come in to
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.200]   physically do work in the basements of
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.040]   buildings in New York where these securities were resisting residing and
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.920]   in the end
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.000]   We straightened it all out and our differences were
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.720]   Insignificant and everybody lived happily ever after but by then I was involved in
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.480]   management rather than in investment banking and that
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.040]   That is why I ended up really in a management position
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.600]   other than an investment bankers position
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.720]   Which I later found I like better anyway when you look back
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:47.120]   What because from the sound of your kindergarten experience? You didn't have an auspicious start to your career
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.920]   You didn't really seem to excel in school
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:57.800]   at least at that that stage and you said with with another year sprinkled in between but yet you passed through the ranks of a
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   large and very respected
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.600]   Wall Street company
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.920]   What were the character traits or personal habits that in hindsight you can look back and identify?
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.280]   That served you well during your career at Lehman Brothers
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.880]   Well
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.120]   There's a couple of things one is I
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:26.240]   Did take it seriously I did show up every day I did work I did what I had to do
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.120]   I was not a person who would go to work 16 hours
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.880]   a day or anything like that
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.840]   But I was conscientious and I think I have good judgment and I think on the whole I got on very well with the management
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.920]   I got on always very well with Bobby Lehman and
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   I
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:51.400]   Was able to work well with people I think that was probably the main thing. I don't think I was
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.840]   The fact that I had no education and hadn't been to a business school was utterly meaningless
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.780]   We had a we in our industry then we and our competitors put a big big
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.240]   Powerful
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:13.360]   Exclamation point on how many people we got out of the good business schools and all that stuff
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:20.020]   Complete waste of time didn't make any difference whether we got the people out of like me out of nowhere or out of
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.800]   Colleges or out of high schools or anything else?
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.600]   We taught them what they needed to know about accounting and about finance
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.560]   And we had to teach them whether they came out of the business schools or whether they came out of eighth grade
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   It really didn't make any difference
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.520]   so
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.180]   What I really did was I I attribute my success
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:49.440]   till largely to what I learned at Lehman Brothers and I learned so much that you don't learn in school and
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.600]   From people who really can teach but don't know their teachers. I can make two examples
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   One is I had a boss named Morris Nadelson
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:06.900]   In the department, I worked for seven years grinding away on on memos and stuff and he
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.880]   Trained me in so many things one day
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:17.520]   I had a person come in with a deal and he wanted to find his fee for bringing it to us and he wanted
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.840]   20% and
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.280]   I had
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.480]   told him pretty much that 20% was more than we ever paid to anybody and
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.640]   We were kind of at a standstill but he was going to come in for another meeting
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:37.360]   My boss said, you know, this is a no deal. Anyway, this not gonna happen
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:44.340]   It's worthless, but I think it's worth it to give you some training. So we're gonna meet with mr
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:50.500]   Kramer who was the man who came in you and I and all I want you to do is to fight for the firm's position
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.340]   Take the position that we never paid more than 10% never had paid more than 10%
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:02.260]   We don't want to set a precedent and the no matter what I say, I want you to take that position and hold it
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:07.460]   So mr. Kramer came in and mr. Nelson and I sat in the room and
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.980]   We got after ten minutes of pleasantries
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:16.260]   We get into the thing and finally we get to the finders fee and mr. Kramer says, you know, I've happened
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:23.780]   I know I've been difficult, but I have to have the 20% that I'm asking for because I'm doing more than anybody's ever done
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.180]   Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah and I do what I'm told I say, you know, we can't do that
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:34.040]   Here are the reason here are five reasons why we just really and not in a position to do it
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:40.140]   And they know me since my boss's Morris says well, wait a minute. Wait a minute Andy
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:44.780]   I think you jump I think you're jumping the gun a little bit. You haven't really listened to mr. Kramer out
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.460]   Didn't you say mr. Kramer that you did this and that and the other thing? Yeah, he said, you know
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:55.700]   I think you want to think twice and guess what over the next 15 or 20 minutes? Mr. Kramer's out of the conversation
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:01.660]   And mr. Nelson and mr. Sage are having a negotiation and he fights like a tiger for
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:07.760]   For mr. Nelson. I mean for mr. Kramer, but guess what at the end Morris?
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.900]   Nielsen says, you know, you're right. I guess we really can't do it and
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:20.540]   It was over the 10% was set and mr. Kramer went out the door didn't know what hit him
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:27.820]   And and again, my boss said to me, you know, we'll probably never see him again. It's a no-deal
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:34.260]   I can tell by talking to him. I didn't do this because I really cared about mr. Kramer Kramer's 20%
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.540]   I did it because I'm teaching you a
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.580]   Element of negotiation and how to use
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:47.100]   one two on one negotiations good cop bad copper call it what you want, right and I
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:54.060]   You learn from this stuff they don't teach you in schools don't teach you they teach you about labor contracts
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:32:00.060]   They don't teach you how to negotiate them Bobby Lehman one day when I was really very high in the firm
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.100]   Again, we were talking about that same department
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.100]   where
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.380]   the same department where they do the the
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.460]   statistical and grinding work of turning out finance documents and
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:18.880]   Bobby got Bobby Lehman got me and and said that I should
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:27.740]   Bear in mind that he saw he knew mr. Osborne was running the company and doing it running that division and doing very well
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.420]   but he said that
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.900]   he that what I had to be careful of was that
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:42.180]   he didn't promote only the people who would grind 20 hours a day and work three hundred and seventy days a year and
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.900]   kill themselves
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.840]   Grinding out the kind of memorandums that he wanted
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.660]   Because he said, you know
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:56.460]   Everybody you have in that department if he stays with us and he's 28 years old now
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:02.020]   He's going to be 38 years old 10 years from now and 48 years old 20 from eight years from now
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:06.740]   And he won't be writing those documents and those memorandums and grinding out
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.820]   multi-column spreadsheets
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.460]   he'll be talking to RCA and
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.820]   IBM and various people who you have or
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:24.300]   Hope to have as clients and you want to be careful that you don't bring up and promote only
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.380]   the grinders
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.140]   But that you look at each of these people you have in your department
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.380]   And if you see somebody who says that he may want to be working eight hours a day
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.740]   But he's doing it and he's conscientious
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.300]   but if he's not killing himself and he's not the
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:44.460]   greatest spreadsheet maker in the world and you're looking at somebody who's going to be
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.780]   The kind of person you want to send to your best client ten years from now
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:54.340]   You want to be sure he's still there and you haven't just promoted a lot of whole a whole lot of grinders
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.140]   Who won't be grinding ten years from now?
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.140]   and
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.340]   That's the kind of lessons that you get that you don't necessarily
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:08.740]   Think about yourself and I thought about it and it was kind of happening. He knew it
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:17.220]   Bobby Lehman, I learned so much from him and he didn't know stock from livestock. He knew nothing about the finance business
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.220]   he he knew about running a a
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:27.260]   Firm and and people and who to promote and who not to promote and who to get rid of and who to keep and how
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.260]   to make salesmen work
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.860]   He was not a technician at all himself and he didn't need it
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:40.860]   Do you think so what year did you leave Lehman what what calendar year did you leave Lehman Brothers?
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.440]   1973 fast forward as we record. This is
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.460]   2017
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.420]   Based upon your knowledge and contacts and exposure that you have to the business world as it continues to be today
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.260]   Do you believe that it's still possible for?
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.280]   People to have the type of career that you had
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:08.060]   back in the 50s 60s and 70s to go from the big, you know, the starting place like you did up through
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.540]   You know president and CEO
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:16.780]   Or as the world changed since then the business anything is possible, but it'd be harder. Why would you say?
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.780]   It's our first place. I
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.100]   Came I came out and I should have covered this really when you asked me
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:30.340]   Well how I got into the in the senior management, I came out of wartime. I came in to the firm in
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.820]   1948
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.960]   But the war really hadn't ended till 46
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.740]   so
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.300]   my
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.300]   bosses the people I worked for
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.020]   Mostly male mostly had been in the service during the war
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:52.260]   They'd only gotten there to they'd get back a year a year a year and a half before I did
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.660]   So I grew up in a generation
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.660]   Of my parents age rather rather than myself
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:05.180]   my seniority in the firm came very quickly because the people I worked for
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:12.020]   Had only been there two years or three years longer than I had for them. Not Bobby Lehman, but but most of them so
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.900]   in the end
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.620]   By the time I was 27 or 28 been there eight years
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.780]   I was hiring people my age that were just coming out of business schools
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.300]   So I got boosted up really a whole generation
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.140]   because
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.260]   in
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:39.260]   1946 the no males had been employed in any company you could get a job no matter who you were or what you were
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.500]   Doing it was not hard
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.780]   The it just hadn't everybody everybody had been in the service. I don't think
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:52.980]   That with my not even not even the high school even two years away from a high school diploma
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.780]   I could possibly have gotten hired into a into a company like that and
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.340]   Succeeded so I would have had to have been a a
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.500]   Steve Wozniak or
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.340]   Steve Jobs or something like that and be a
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:17.260]   Incredible genius and go go on my own and make it then really into the top
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:21.060]   It's possible, but honestly in my case
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.620]   It would have been tough going now. I'm not saying that
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.580]   that I couldn't have
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.860]   Gotten that I did get the first job
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:34.060]   I got because they were looking for people to at the first brokerage firm
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.900]   I went to it didn't matter and when I went to Lehman's I knew the
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.420]   Partner who invited me and no one ever asked me they didn't even ask me where I went to school
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.260]   It never even came up
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.420]   They knew I'd worked in the street and they hired me for the 50 bucks a week and put me in
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.140]   I
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.820]   think that I
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.260]   Think that that part would be really tough now
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:38:01.060]   If you go all you can show is that you're 18 and you're still in the two years away from being a high school senior
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.700]   It'd be very very very hard to get a job now
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:12.920]   You know, maybe in McDonald's but but real job be very very hard very hard to do
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.060]   I have a granddaughter who's been to school forever and she's a a
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.660]   computer generated artist and
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:28.260]   She's having she's got a job but she's not having an easy time of it
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.380]   she wants to be in the in the probably in the gaming industry or someplace where
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:39.780]   Computer graphics are really vital and and and the training is tremendous
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:47.980]   And she'll get something but not not not as easy as I got when I started so I think that I was really very lucky
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:53.380]   I wouldn't recommend to anybody that they just drop out of school for the hell of it and
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.780]   Hope for the best to end up in a really good job
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.180]   What asked one more question and luck is tremendous
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:05.820]   Right one asked one more question about your career and then transition to some of the life lessons you've learned
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.500]   with regard to lifestyle and personal finance
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.140]   Obviously as we sit here in
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:19.820]   2017 we are a decade removed from the financial crisis in which Lehman Brothers played kind of a leading
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.420]   How do how do I how do I?
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.140]   leading
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.620]   Decade ago, and I'm just curious from your you were inside
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:36.220]   The Wall Street world and then you kind of went outside and involved in the business world and now you've watched
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:41.460]   Lehman a decade ago go bankrupt and then today, you know, we're a decade after that
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.620]   but of course, you're still in a student Vesta and pay attention I
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:51.340]   Wonder oftentimes how much trust to place into
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:59.860]   Companies, especially how much trust to placed in into financial companies because it seems very hard for me to discern
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:06.740]   From an external perspective what's actually going on versus, you know what the insiders know
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:12.100]   Do you what advice would you give to somebody like me? Who's looking to be?
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.460]   thoughtful and careful with regard to
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:22.220]   Financial institutions. I'm looking to be reasonable to be practical to be to deal with facts
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:27.140]   But also, you know, we have could have concerns. How do how do I even approach that?
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.660]   philosophically in today's world
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:35.620]   Well the best you can but you want to be very very careful
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.980]   the
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.700]   decade ago
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.700]   market crash
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:50.900]   Was no accident it came about from a combination of three things
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.860]   Stupidity
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.980]   Greed and incompetence and when you put those three things together
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:07.580]   You really have a disaster now if you own a shoe store and you do that. It's too bad and
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.460]   Despite the fact that you hire somebody like I used to be to be a fixer or whatever
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:18.200]   Yes, you store go down and it's not the end of the world. And even if it's an automobile company
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   It's not the end of the world
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.380]   and
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.500]   If it's the government
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.900]   It gets close to the end of the world and if it's high finance
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.740]   it is the end of the world and
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.020]   You had
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.740]   those three ingredients there and
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.580]   Then and you would be very
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:51.980]   Ill-advised to assume that some wonderful thing has happened and none of those three characteristics are not there anymore
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.860]   it was just another way of saying be very very careful the
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.060]   Problem isn't with investment banks it
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.020]   there
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.540]   their service
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.460]   Their service oriented. The truth is a Lehman Brothers
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.860]   going down sounds terrible, but it really didn't make any difference a
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.900]   City bank going down would make
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.660]   The difference of life and death for all of us
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:26.740]   We have that because once something like that happens everybody runs on all the banks and we all know that the banks
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:32.660]   spend and use a huge multiple of the amount of the deposits they had and if
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:37.660]   Anybody lined up to get everybody lining up in one day to get their deposits out of any bank
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:41.060]   It couldn't be done. So you have a situation where you could have a
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.620]   Absolute total crash which could have well happened back in
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.380]   2009 or whatever it was
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:53.580]   But the what was left of the Bush Bush administration in the Obama administration
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.700]   Bailed out the banks as they absolutely had to do
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:06.580]   And and a little bit more than the banks, but they had to be bailed out. They caused the failure of the country and
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:16.580]   Unsupervised they were not adequately supervised and the result was nearly utterly catastrophic
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.220]   if I
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.220]   Have to think about financial
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.980]   difficulties
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.100]   That might come across my path
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:32.060]   Failure of the financial system as a result of the banks is certainly high on the list
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:39.500]   Lehman Brothers never was a bank a number of other people who were not banks either such as
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.460]   Goldman Sachs and others
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:48.740]   Declared themselves banks. What you're saying is they were never commercial banks. They were never commercial, right?
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:55.020]   They were never commercial bank. They were invested. They didn't take they didn't take creditors. They didn't take people's deposits and write checks
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.420]   That's the function of a commercial bank. That's what that's what a bank is
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.060]   It holds depositors money, right?
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:05.820]   but not technically you can be a bank if you qualify and you have good enough lawyers and you can be a you can
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.460]   Declare yourself a bank overnight and be available for federal aid and whatever it is
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:16.420]   But these aren't the companies I worry about their service companies and they usually smarter
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:22.660]   The ones I worry about are the big giant commercial banks any one of which
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:30.100]   If it failed could cause a spiral that could run all our bloods cold in terms of any other investments
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:34.420]   We have it's really really very serious it
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.580]   Money is a confidence game. You have to have confidence
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.380]   values
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.380]   if I if I if I
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:49.260]   Buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars and it's now worth a million dollars. I feel I'm worth a million dollars
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:53.780]   But I'm not I only paid a hundred thousand dollars. That's the money that was paid
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.820]   The rest of it is confidence. The rest of it is confidence
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:04.500]   And that's that's that's a smaller multiple that we then we have to think about so we're living
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.860]   in confidence of our very existence in our financial existence
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:15.900]   And if anything breaks that confidence markets crash not only not only the stock market
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.100]   But the real estate market which everybody thought couldn't crash it crashed
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:25.860]   so all of a sudden you don't have what you think you have and you stop spending in the spiral is
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.580]   fatal and
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:35.900]   This is always a risk and I think the the biggest risk of all is the is the confidence
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.220]   How do you protect yourself against that I don't know how you protect yourself against that you
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:47.220]   Try not to do it not to do extremes and you certainly supervise
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:52.820]   Anything that's not important has to be supervised and you never let up on your supervised
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:58.300]   Supervising of big banks you see it over and over again. You see it here
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:03.900]   you see it now in Deutsche Bank you see it in Wells Fargo where a
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:12.260]   Commission system for getting new accounts gets carried to the point where in
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.340]   money is
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.380]   unbelievably large and you have thousands of employees and
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:23.140]   that couldn't even be kept because they were involved in the
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.980]   in basically fraudulent
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:34.020]   internal accounting not external not not not dangerous in itself to the financial world, but
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:41.860]   It's just shows the lack of control or the difficulty of controlling a business
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.700]   where you have senior executives by the
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:50.740]   hundreds of thousands spread all over the world in banks and and and in in branc branches and
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:58.380]   It would be unrealistic to think that you don't have to have confidence that that's being
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.380]   Guarded and that you have every
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:09.180]   Safeguard in there that you can think of so as you don't allow one of these great big banks to fail there have been
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.580]   There has been a movement
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:20.340]   Hasn't gone much of anywhere of putting some kind of a limit on the size of a bank and I
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:29.180]   Think that's that sort of thing really isn't what you want to do in a in a free market and enterprising country like the United
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:35.460]   States but it's something you want to be thinking about you want to be thinking about why people even want to do it and
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.780]   Put it in every safeguard you can to try and see that
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.420]   Something doesn't go to pieces that
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.260]   traders don't
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.300]   Take positions that you can't find
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:54.060]   it's just so many many things when you come to big amounts of money and where they can be stored and and
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.860]   Just do the best you can and
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:04.700]   But I think it's I think it's the biggest single risk to the to the economy into the stock market
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.980]   is the
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:13.260]   Is that is that the danger of a catastrophic mess in the banking system? All right
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.860]   It's only gotten worse in the last decade
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.300]   They're calling us. It has gotten worse in the last. Yeah, yeah by far
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:26.400]   We would think we could talk all afternoon. They're calling us for lunch. So I only got time for one question
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:30.500]   I may have to come back and do another interview just like specifically on on finance sometime
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.660]   But maybe I'll just kind of close with this you are
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:41.180]   9091 now 91 91. No, I'm not 90. You're not almost 91. Okay, so you're 90 years old
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:45.100]   Do you think of yourself as retired at this point?
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.220]   well, I
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:54.260]   Retired from employment. Yes, I
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.800]   Can't think of anybody that's paying me any money to do anything
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.820]   though maybe
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:05.080]   But I'm I'm not retired and that I have to work
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:11.180]   See that on my own money is protected. I'm not very rich, but I'm not very poor and
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:16.020]   And that keeps me busy. I just got to clarify for my audience
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.620]   When Andy says I'm not very rich, but I'm not very poor
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.540]   We're uh, you know, you live in beautiful place here in Palm Beach, Florida
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.960]   In the standards of in the standards of global wealth. You've done. All right
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:35.600]   Absolutely, absolutely when we compare ourselves to but we got these hundreds millions and billions and things
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.660]   I'm not I'm not I don't come from an era where that happened. Really, right?
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.700]   when I was a
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:46.100]   Went to live over 50 buck $50 a week
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.860]   When I was made a partner
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:57.260]   And I think I might have been 32 or 34 some in my early 30s. I
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:02.180]   Think I
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.500]   Think I got
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.540]   19,000
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.180]   Being a general partner on inflation adjusted one of about
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:18.700]   30 or 25 or 30 general partners in a major thing. I was I
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.260]   Got I wasn't getting quite $20,000
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:29.660]   When I I don't really remember but I think when I was running the firm I
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:33.780]   Think I I got a million dollars
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.980]   The same person now begin
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:44.340]   72 you know, I didn't I didn't grow up in an era, right?
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:48.580]   where the money the money was the kind of money it is now and
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:54.780]   If I had I'd have more than I have and I'm comfortable, but I'm not in the league of
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:59.300]   I'm not the league of people that that have or had
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.700]   Recently had jobs at the level of the one I had that right
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:09.700]   so when you look at and the reason I ask is I just simply have noticed this and
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:13.340]   My audience knows the question that's coming because it's a constant refrain
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:20.980]   I spent years working as a financial advisor and a major core aspect of that was this concept of retirement
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:28.660]   the idea of retirement being kind of the traditional work save money in your 401k until you're 65 so you can afford to quit your
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.540]   Job and go and live the life that you really love, but I came to notice two things. I came to notice that
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.700]   number one
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:41.700]   The vast majority of people who want to retire will never financially be able to accumulate the money to retire
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.720]   Simply because they don't save enough money and the returns are too low and it's mathematically impossible
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:54.900]   absent some crazy, you know speculative speculation and something and the second thing I noticed was that the people who are the most
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.540]   financially in the position to retire
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:03.860]   Very rarely ever chose to do that. They've always chosen to continue to be involved now
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.300]   They might change they might go from earning a salary to earning a stipend. They're sitting on a board
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:12.300]   They're you know working for a nonprofit. They're continuing to manage their own things
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:18.580]   But a lot of times the wealthiest people never really retire. They certainly change they pull back they move out of responsibility
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.860]   And so I've tried to point that out to recognize that the whole
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:29.900]   Financial industry the retail investment industry is built around a flawed concept built around this lifestyle
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:36.700]   That no one's really ever gonna do and here you are at 90 years old almost 91 years old and you're active and you're fit
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.620]   and you're here with dancing with your wife and
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:45.140]   My listeners can can tell the passion that's coming out of your voice for business and you're mentally alert
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:50.540]   You look strong. Yeah, like you look like a much younger man, and I would attribute that to your non retirement
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.060]   So I'm just interested as we close
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:56.940]   Do you have any opinion on the subject of retirement from your observation and experience in the world?
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.060]   Well, yeah
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.200]   I just agree with everything you I agree with everything you said
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:09.780]   I said it's a in my case. I was very sloppy about it. I really I
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:16.420]   Never really thought about it. I could have got a retirement from Lehman Brothers. I didn't even get it
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:24.220]   They didn't even set it up because I went out so gradually I was I was president then I became a vice chairman
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:31.300]   Then I became a consultant and just drifted off and I never even formally left the place
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   You're still on their
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:41.880]   Health insurance and that that disappeared when they went broke so so I
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:50.220]   Personally personally I didn't have to and I didn't do much I get a retirement here and there I've served on a lot of boards
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.180]   big companies
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.300]   They don't have retirements
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.100]   So I never got really a retirement
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:05.000]   But I did get enough money to be able to manage my own sort of retirement
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.220]   But that that's just lucky
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:13.940]   most people that that isn't going to happen and the system is flawed and
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:16.780]   It's going to fall more and more
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:25.180]   On the people that what the the upside of that is that people make many people
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:31.940]   Don't nobody goes to work for $50 a week anymore. And and if people are reasonably successful
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:38.260]   They're be able to look after their parents to some extent the parents will have saved enough to get by
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.820]   But it's tough
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.140]   All right, she's saying we're done
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.940]   Andy thank you. I want to thank you for
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:51.380]   For doing the interview here. I think it's really been a service to my audience
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.620]   I'm just want to thank you for your friendship to me over the years and I
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:58.500]   We could talk all afternoon. I've enjoyed hearing the lessons that
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:04.420]   That you have to share any closing thoughts as far as final words of advice or encouragement to my listeners
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:08.460]   If
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:13.720]   Anything the we talked about safety we talked about retirement
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.780]   If
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:24.340]   It's very hard to find provide any real answers, but I find that I've drifted toward real estate
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.540]   it ain't perfect and
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:29.580]   2009 showed
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:33.180]   bad things that can happen, but on the whole I
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.980]   tend to think that
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.220]   real estate investments are
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:42.660]   Some something between
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:46.180]   Safe and
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:51.860]   And and not safe I just think
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:57.580]   For me. I don't really dare go into the stock market at 90
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:02.820]   because one bad turn could do me and it won't have time to get back right and
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:06.060]   I have leaned I've just kind of fallen
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.620]   sort of the buying
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.620]   condos and renting them out or
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:19.020]   Commercial real estate and and getting a combination of return for my money and
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:24.700]   Hopefully appreciation on the land that that's kind of kind of the direction I've gone in
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:33.380]   For my own retirement that's kind of what it is. It takes a little work, but but I think it's worth doing
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:40.460]   Simplicity is to be valued when it comes to investing and real estate has the hallmarks of being relatively simple. Yeah
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.660]   Andy thank you for coming on
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:50.140]   We're done. We're done. Thank you Andy. I
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:58.100]   Hope you enjoyed and appreciated that interview with Andy just a couple of quick thoughts as I hit the music here as we go
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.740]   First of all, if you enjoyed that
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:05.020]   Recognize the fact that you don't only have to listen to podcasts

[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.580]   Have you gone and sought them out?
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:20.980]   Have you gone and sat down with them and asked them for their advice or dug into their career?
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.460]   Think you can learn a lot by doing that
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:30.780]   Don't leave it just to me and the podcast go sit down with somebody in your local community
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:39.740]   Andy's a neat guy. He's just always giving back. I hope you paid attention to his comments there on retirement there at the end
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.660]   I've known him for quite a while and I'll just affirm that
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:47.980]   You know, he doesn't sit around and do nothing. He's busy. He's active and his life
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:53.020]   Reflects that you can do the same thing if you enjoyed that con interview

[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.220]   And I'm sure he'd love to do another interview
