[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.320]   - Assuming that most people wake up in the morning,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.240]   as opposed to night shift workers, et cetera,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.400]   we could talk about later.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.200]   But they wake up in the morning,
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.600]   so let's divide the day into quarters.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.760]   What is the proper way to interact with light
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.360]   in the first part of the day?
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.600]   - So I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.080]   Get as much light as you can.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.920]   - Into your eyes.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.200]   - Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.580]   Your system is primed.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.640]   If you're entrained, it's primed to get light.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.440]   The sun should be out.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.800]   Most animals in the wild,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.080]   they actually seem to track the sun.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.520]   The sun has a huge influence on life on Earth.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.640]   It's actually, life on Earth is because of sun.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.820]   So that's easy.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.800]   In the morning, when you wake up, you need light.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200]   - Okay, so what is the behavioral practice
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.760]   that you recommend?
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.920]   Does it, let's say somebody is in a condition
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.440]   where there's a lot of cloud cover.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.280]   - Yeah.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.400]   - Is it important to get outside?
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.560]   - So I have to tell you,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.140]   the cloudiest day is gonna be much more brighter
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.980]   than your room.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.080]   You could ask any photographer.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.220]   A cloudy day, unless it's really dark, dark clouds,
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.560]   usually cloudy days have much more bright outside
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.580]   than inside the room,
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.480]   even when you have good lighting inside the room.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.720]   So I think in the outside is usually,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.300]   even when it's cloudy, you're gonna get enough intensity
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.480]   to help you adjust your cycle to the day-night cycle.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.600]   - So how long do you,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.760]   these are general rules of thumb,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.040]   but how long do you recommend people go outside?
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.680]   - So if you do it daily, you possibly need very,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.600]   if you do it daily,
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.440]   because remember,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.240]   this thing is gonna happen on a daily matter.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.080]   So let's say 15 minutes.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.840]   - So the clock is tracking it on a regular basis.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.360]   - Absolutely, it's photon counting, it's tracking.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.440]   I would say 15 minutes.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.400]   If you don't do it daily, you may wanna increase it.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   And we'll talk about when you travel, what you could do.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.760]   But yeah, 15 minutes should be fine.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.640]   You do it more, it doesn't hurt.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.140]   - And through a window, I was,
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.960]   my understanding is that through a window,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.640]   it dramatically decreases the amount of light energy.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.480]   - It depends of how, you know,
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.960]   how thick the windows are and how dark they are.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.640]   So it's, but it's also nice to go outside
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.240]   and to feel the season.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.840]   - Sunglasses off.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.440]   - I don't use sunglasses.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.600]   - But you have the Jordanian for pigment, you know, so.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.100]   Yeah, whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right?
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.880]   - No, but I personally, you know,
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   if I'm in the shade or if it's not incredibly bright,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.780]   I try to, especially in the morning,
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.360]   but I'm also an early person.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.000]   So we have to differentiate between early.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   - What time do you wake up?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.560]   - I wake up at 4.30 in the morning.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.640]   - But the sun isn't out yet.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.880]   - It's not out yet, so it's.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.720]   - So what do you do?
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.880]   You turn on artificial lights?
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.960]   - I usually don't turn on artificial light
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.300]   because I know the sun is gonna come up eventually.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.720]   But that's why I don't like the change
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.800]   in the timing that they do.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.520]   - Wait, but what do you do between 4.30 a.m. and 7 a.m.?
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.040]   - I mean, I just got my computer and my phone.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.480]   So possibly I get enough light.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.080]   But in reality, I mean,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.580]   as long as you let your body get the morning sunlight,
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.980]   which I think is really, to me,
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.780]   and there's no evidence, but to me, this is,
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.620]   if you look at all animals, plants,
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.140]   this morning sunlight seems to be very important.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.160]   And I, you know, we don't have experiments to show it,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.500]   but I have a gut feeling that it has a huge impact
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.460]   on humans.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.140]   - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab at the Stanford Sleep Lab
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.900]   has shown that these early morning light flashes
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.420]   can adjust the total amount of sleep
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.860]   that one will get and makes it easier to get into sleep.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.700]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.520]   - Okay, so--
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.000]   - And Ken Wright also did this beautiful camping experiments
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   that showed--
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.360]   - Right, maybe you should describe those,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.600]   'cause those are beautiful experiments.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.960]   - They are beautiful experiments.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.680]   He took these, you know, college students
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400]   that had a late onset of sleep and late waking time.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.000]   And then he said, "Let's go camping
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.460]   "and just don't use any artificial light.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.460]   "And you could go to sleep as late or as early as you want
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.040]   "and wake up as late as early."
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.760]   And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.160]   just by exposing them to the light-dark cycle.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.280]   I mean, so--
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.400]   - And it lasted.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.240]   - And it lasted.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.080]   - Even after they came back.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.920]   - Exactly.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.740]   - I think it was two days of camping,
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.580]   reset the circadian clock.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.120]   - Seven days, but it lasted.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.680]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.500]   Yeah, it's really incredible.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.160]   - Okay, so get bright light of some sort early in the day,
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.480]   ideally sunlight, even on a cloudy day,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.440]   it's going to be brighter than indoor light.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.320]   - So that's easy.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.160]   - Okay, so then--
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.800]   - And the other thing that I would like
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.140]   to mention to people, if you think it's very dim outside,
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.280]   let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.040]   So remember, intensity is only one component.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.600]   Duration is also important,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.260]   because remember that the circadian system,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.720]   it's not like the image system.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.080]   In the image system, you have to change every second
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.720]   because you're looking at different objects.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.760]   You have to change your perception.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.880]   But for the circadian system, it's trying to figure out
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   where am I in the day-night cycle?
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.740]   So the more you give them the information,
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.760]   the better you are.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.280]   So if it's very bright, you don't need a lot,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.440]   because it's clearly going to make you fire like crazy.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.400]   But if it's not bright, stay longer.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.440]   Stay for one hour, have your coffee outside
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.480]   or something like that.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.960]   It's just going to help.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.800]   - I think you said something extremely important,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.000]   which is that this circadian system
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.960]   is trying to figure out when you are in time.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.800]   - Exactly.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.640]   - Not where you are in space.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.240]   - Sorry, I said where you are in time.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.320]   I meant when you are.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.480]   - Oh, no, no, I wasn't correcting you.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.820]   I just meant that, I think fundamentally,
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.620]   that's the incredible thing about this system,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.540]   that you have this clock, this 24-hour clock in your brain,
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.300]   but it needs to be synchronized to the outside.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.580]   So could we go a little deeper
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.180]   into this circadian setting behavior
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.060]   and come up with some general rules of thumb?
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.000]   So let's say it's a very bright day, extremely bright.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.280]   No clouds, sun's out.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.540]   You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.780]   And I'll tell you, if you're sensitive,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.460]   you don't even have to go in the sun.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.860]   You could be in the shade.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.980]   There's going to be so many photons out there in the shade.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.060]   It's going to be perfect.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.100]   You don't even have to see the sun.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.900]   You don't have to have the sun.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.060]   It's great for vitamin D.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.020]   That's a different story.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.900]   You could do this for your skin and protect your skin.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.520]   That's not my area of expertise.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.460]   But for that effect on the circadian system,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.700]   as long as you're outside in the shade and it's a sunny day,
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.300]   10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.980]   - Okay, and then let's say it's kind of overcast.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.680]   It's not particularly bright or there's solid cloud cover,
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.020]   but obviously the sun is out, but it's not as bright.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.100]   How long do you think it would take to set the clock?
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.060]   - 10 to 15 should be sufficient.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.500]   Stay for half an hour, stay for 45 minutes.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.560]   If it's very dark cloud, yeah, stay for longer.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.140]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.560]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.220]   (upbeat music)
