[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.220]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.640]   Today, my guest is Dr. Casey Halpern.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   Dr. Halpern is the chief of neurosurgery
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.580]   at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.560]   His laboratory focuses on bulimia, binge eating disorder,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.500]   and other forms of obsessive compulsive behaviors.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.380]   Normally, when we hear about eating disorders
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.960]   or obsessive compulsive disorders of other kinds,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.460]   the conversation quickly migrates
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.480]   to pharmacologic interventions and serotonin or dopamine
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.160]   or talk therapy interventions,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.300]   many of which can be effective.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.680]   The Halpern Laboratory, however,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.440]   takes an entirely different approach.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.600]   While they embrace pharmacologic and behavioral
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.120]   and talk therapy interventions,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120]   their main focus is the development and application
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.000]   of engineered devices to go directly into the brain
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.200]   and stimulate the neurons, the nerve cells,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.920]   that generate compulsions,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.520]   that cause people to want to eat more
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.720]   even when their stomach is full.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.960]   In other words, they do brain surgery of various kinds,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.780]   sometimes removing small bits of brain,
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020]   sometimes stimulating small bits of brain
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.140]   with electrical current,
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.220]   and even stimulating the brain through the intact skull,
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.520]   that is, without having to drill down beneath the skull
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.240]   in order to alleviate and indeed sometimes cure
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.160]   these conditions.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.580]   Today's discussion with Dr. Halpern
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.900]   was an absolutely fascinating one for me
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.980]   because it represents the leading edge
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.640]   of what's happening in modification of brain circuits
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.820]   and the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.360]   For instance, they just recently published a paper
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.600]   in "Nature Medicine,"
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.120]   one of the premier journals out there,
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   entitled "Pilot Study of Responsive Nucleus Accumbens
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.920]   "Deep Brain Stimulation for Loss of Control Eating."
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.780]   The nucleus accumbens is an area of our brains
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.520]   that we all have, in fact, we have two of them,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.180]   one on each side of the brain,
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.480]   that is intimately involved in the release of dopamine
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   for particular motivated behaviors.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.080]   And while most often we think about dopamine
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.720]   for the release of behaviors that we want to engage in,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.820]   in this context, they are using stimulation
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.720]   and control of neuronal activity in nucleus accumbens
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.160]   to control loss of control eating,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.960]   something that when people suffer from it,
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.720]   despite knowing that they shouldn't eat,
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.180]   despite not even wanting to eat,
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.680]   they find themselves eating.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.120]   So again, this represents really the leading edge
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.760]   of where neuroscience is going,
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.700]   and it certainly is going to be an area of neuroscience
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.600]   that's going to expand in the years to come.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.320]   And Dr. Halpern and the members of his laboratory
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.280]   are among a very small group of scientists in the world
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.640]   that are using the types of approaches
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.080]   that I described a minute ago,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320]   and that you're going to hear more about in today's episode
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.540]   in order to resolve some of the most difficult
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.560]   and debilitating human conditions.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.480]   During today's discussion, you will also learn
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   about the use of deep brain stimulation and other approaches
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   for the treatment of movement disorders,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.120]   such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.840]   and various types of dystonias,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.640]   which are challenges in generating
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.240]   particular types of movement.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.600]   So whether or not you or somebody that you know
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.140]   suffers from an eating disorder,
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.920]   from obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.480]   or from a movement disorder,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.400]   today's episode is sure to teach you
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.880]   not only about what's happening in those arenas,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.720]   but also in the arenas of neuroscience generally.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.160]   In fact, I would say today's episode
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.640]   is especially important for anyone
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.280]   that wants to understand how the brain works
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.780]   and what the future of brain modification
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.120]   really looks like for all of us.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.860]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.640]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.920]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.520]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.360]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.420]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.200]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.240]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.200]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.280]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.880]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.560]   and sunglasses were created with performance in mind.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.480]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.720]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.260]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.200]   with a number of very important challenges
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.180]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.140]   For instance, when you go from a sunny area
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.120]   to a more shaded area and then back out again.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.720]   It's a very complex process.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.380]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were built,
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.320]   that is engineered, with that sort of biology in mind.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.140]   And as a consequence, no matter where you are wearing them
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.200]   and where you happen to be,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.440]   you always see through them with crystal clarity.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.600]   The aesthetic of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.960]   is also worth mentioning.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.200]   Unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.080]   which only come in the kind of cyborg variety,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.280]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in those varieties,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.760]   but they also come in varieties
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.800]   that you would feel very comfortable wearing out to dinner
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.540]   or to work or to school, really anywhere that you go.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.120]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.680]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.480]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.840]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.800]   Eight Sleep makes mattress covers
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.400]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking ability.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.760]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.980]   about the close relationship between temperature
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.040]   and your ability to stay asleep and emerge from sleep.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.600]   The way Eight Sleep mattress covers work
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.640]   is that they allow you to program the temperature
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.320]   of your mattress so that you can fall asleep quickly,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.480]   get into deep sleep, stay in deep sleep,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.220]   and emerge from that sleep feeling especially rested
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.320]   by dropping the temperature of that surface
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.640]   by one to three degrees at the beginning of the night,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.520]   dropping it a little bit further into the night,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.280]   and then raising the temperature towards morning
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   because waking up requires
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.600]   that one to three degree re-increase in body temperature.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.440]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.200]   for the last six months or so now,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.640]   and I can assert that it is the absolute biggest game changer
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.460]   in the quality and duration of my sleep.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.940]   In fact, I don't really like traveling as much as I used to
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.060]   because the Eight Sleep doesn't go with me
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.480]   and they don't seem to have them yet in Airbnbs and hotels.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.760]   So this is also a call to action.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.120]   Airbnbs and hotels, please put Eight Sleep mattresses
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.600]   on your beds and I'll be more apt to stay in those hotels
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.020]   and Airbnbs.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.860]   With that said,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.720]   if you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.480]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman,

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.320]   And please note that Eight Sleep currently ships
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.280]   in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.520]   select countries in the EU and Australia.

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.780]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.360]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.880]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.760]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.940]   Now I've long been a believer
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.300]   in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.760]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.000]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.420]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.340]   One of the major issues with the various blood tests
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.480]   out there is that you get information back
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.960]   about lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.120]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.080]   With Inside Tracker, they make knowing what to do
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   with the information you get
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.880]   about your biological health extremely easy.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.200]   They have this very easy to use dashboard,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.240]   and that dashboard tells you, for instance,
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.860]   what to change in your nutrition,
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.000]   what supplements you may want or may not want to take,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.340]   as well as other behavioral and other types of interventions
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.240]   that can allow you to move those numbers
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.880]   related to metabolic, hormone, and other factors
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.640]   into the precise range that's optimal
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.540]   for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.920]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.800]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.240]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.660]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.200]   we talk about supplements.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.320]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.840]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.480]   things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.200]   or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.500]   or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.060]   to optimal range for you.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.800]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.160]   with Momentous Supplements.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.820]   We partner with Momentous for a number of important reasons.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.260]   First of all, the quality of their ingredients
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.540]   is exceptional, it's really second to none.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.320]   Second of all, they ship internationally,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.400]   and that was important to us
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.120]   because a number of you reside outside of the United States.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.660]   Third, we've worked with Momentous very closely
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.080]   to develop single ingredient formulations.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now, this turns out to be very important
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.200]   because if you're going to take supplements,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.600]   you want to know what's working for you and what isn't.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.780]   And of course, you want to optimize the cost efficiency
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.840]   and the biological efficiency of those supplements.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.160]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.380]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.000]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.340]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.960]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.140]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.220]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.400]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.220]   Casey, I should say Dr. Halpern for those listening, welcome.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.280]   - Thank you, great to be here.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.580]   - Yeah, it's been a long time coming.
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.740]   We were colleagues at Stanford.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.600]   And then recently you moved, of course,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.120]   to University of Pennsylvania,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.760]   also an incredible institution.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.520]   We're sorry to lose you.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.720]   - It was bittersweet for me too.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.920]   - Stanford's loss is UPenn's gain.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.480]   But let's talk about your work, past and present.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.080]   As I've told the listeners already, you're a neurosurgeon,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.640]   which I consider the astronauts of neuroscience
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.520]   because you're in somewhat uncharted territory
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.840]   or very uncharted territory.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.760]   And yet precision is everything, right?
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.320]   The margins of error are very, very small.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.800]   So for those that aren't familiar with the differences
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.760]   between neurosurgery, neurology, psychiatry,
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.720]   you just educate us a bit.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.760]   What does a neurosurgeon do?
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.080]   And what does the fact that you're a neurosurgeon
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.820]   do for your view of the brain?
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.800]   How do you think about and conceptualize the brain?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.480]   - Yeah, the scope of neurosurgery is quite broad.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.320]   When I was in medical school, I was drawn to neurosurgery
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.620]   because of a procedure known as deep brain stimulation.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.960]   When I was at Penn as a college student,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.800]   I actually watched my first deep brain stimulation surgery
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.000]   performed by Gordon Baltuck,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.300]   who to date is one of my career mentors.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.480]   Deep brain stimulation is one surgery
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.000]   that neurosurgeons offer,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.960]   but it's actually sort of a very small minority
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.200]   of what neurosurgery does.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.760]   You know, we take out brain tumors,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.820]   we clip aneurysms in the brain,
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.200]   we take care of patients
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.080]   that have had traumatic brain injury,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.000]   concussion, spine surgeries,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.440]   90% of what neurosurgeons do around the country,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.020]   you know, taking care of herniated discs and lumbar fusions.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.020]   So the scope is the entire central nervous system,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.960]   including the peripheral nervous system,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.000]   we take care of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.360]   and nerve disorders.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.220]   Now over the course of the past two decades or so,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.300]   there's been a mission in the field to sub-specialize.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.040]   And so historically neurosurgeons
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   did everything in that domain,
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.160]   but now we sub-specialize
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.540]   and I'm lucky to be at Penn Medicine
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.540]   where we can focus on one of these areas.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.220]   So I'm chief of stereotactic functional neurosurgery.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.800]   All I do is deep brain stimulation surgery
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.880]   and a compliment to that is focus ultrasound
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.140]   or transcranial focus ultrasound,
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.480]   which is a non-invasive way to do an ablation in the brain,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.160]   recently FDA approved,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.560]   and it's FDA approved for tremor at the moment.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.480]   These two procedures are for me, my everyday,
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.140]   but still the minority of what neurosurgeons have to offer.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.760]   The majority of neurosurgery in my mind
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.520]   is a bit more structural than it is physiology
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:35.080]   or deeply rooted in how the brain functions.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.560]   When we take out a brain tumor,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.920]   we have to find a safe trajectory to get to the brain tumor
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.280]   and then we remove it
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.200]   and we help the patient recover in the ICU.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.640]   Similar to a brain aneurysm,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.120]   often we don't have to go into the brain
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.160]   to clip a brain aneurysm,
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.740]   but we go around the brain or under the brain to get there.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.440]   And in my mind, those surgeries are a bit more structural.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.120]   Deep brain stimulation, the surgery that I do routinely,
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.720]   is a procedure where,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.120]   yes, there is structure involved, of course.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.540]   We have to place a very thin wire that's insulated
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.960]   deep into a part of the brain
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.000]   that's involved in Parkinson's disease, for example.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.120]   But that's actually not the therapy.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.560]   The therapy is delivering electrical stimulation
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.640]   through the tip of that wire, or one of the tips,
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.500]   as there actually are multiple contacts
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.800]   at the bottom of the wire, they're very small.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.920]   But that's all done out of the operating room.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.720]   This stimulation wire is connected to a battery pack
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.560]   or a pulse generator that's kind of like a pacemaker.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.720]   And so we deliver this therapy and I always tell patients,
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   it's a bit more like I have to implant a tool
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.920]   to deliver you a medication,
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.720]   but that medication is gonna be in the form of electricity
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.600]   and it's gonna be delivered
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.000]   into a very small region of the brain.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.140]   And it's that procedure that's inspired me
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.040]   to not just become a neurosurgeon,
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.600]   but has really defined the focus
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.300]   of my research laboratory as well.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.880]   - Maybe by way of anecdote,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.880]   you could tell us one of the more outrageous or surprising,
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.460]   or who knows, delightful and thrilling things
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.640]   about the brain that you've observed
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.520]   as a consequence of stimulating different brain areas.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.920]   In textbooks, we always hear about the kind of dark stuff,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.400]   stimulate one brain area, somebody goes into a rage,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.080]   stimulate another brain area,
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.680]   person starts laughing uncontrollably.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.920]   First of all, given that some of the information,
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.760]   and let's hope not much,
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.540]   but some of the information in textbooks is incorrect,
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.900]   are those sorts of statements true?
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.740]   Can one observe those in the clinic?
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.180]   And what are some of the more interesting
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.280]   and I don't necessarily mean entertaining,
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.460]   but surprising things that you've seen
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.880]   when you've poked around in the brain,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.040]   deliberately, of course.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.420]   And what have you seen?
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.920]   What have you heard?
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.160]   - I have to say, I am amazed by these effects every day.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.480]   Yeah, I'm very privileged to be able to interact
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.720]   with the human brain in this way.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.800]   It's always with the goal of trying to provide somebody
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.960]   with a meaningful therapy.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.200]   But when we deliver electrical stimulation,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.920]   these electrodes, while they might be sitting
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.500]   in a very small region of the brain,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.440]   there are regions within a few millimeters
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.520]   of where these electrodes are
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.320]   that if stimulated could cause a temporary,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.160]   very brief side effect,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.760]   a moment of laughter, like you said,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.200]   or a moment of panic.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.720]   And of course we can just shut that electrode off.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.240]   But often these side effects could be therapeutic.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.480]   And actually that's how we have discovered ways
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.160]   to use deep brain stimulation,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.320]   not just for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease,
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.000]   but for example, patients with Parkinson's disease
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   that have a psychiatric comorbidity like depression
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.860]   or obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.120]   A lot of these patients are highly compulsive and impulsive.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.580]   Sometimes these problems actually melt away
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.140]   and we're trying to help their tremor,
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.820]   but the patients also tell us that their gambling issue
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.240]   has gotten better or their mood has improved.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.080]   And why is that?
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.760]   Well, there's probably more than one reason.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.000]   You can help somebody's mood
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.140]   by making their tremor go away, of course,
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.980]   but we see laughter in the clinic sometimes.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.820]   And why is that?
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.560]   And that's because we're stimulating parts of the brain
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.960]   that are not just involved in these motor circuits,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.080]   but they're also involved in what we call a limbic circuit
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   or part of the brain involved in emotion.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.820]   And if we learn how to modulate those areas therapeutically,
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.320]   step-by-step, we can actually develop these therapies
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.800]   for other indications like depression.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.000]   I would say the most impressive and consistent effect
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.160]   we have when we have a patient with tremor,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.120]   who has been tremoring for the past 20 years,
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.320]   if we can deliver stimulation through that electrode
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.880]   in the clinic, we have immediate relief of tremor.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.000]   And that is the effect that inspired me
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.920]   to be a neurosurgeon when I was in college.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.360]   I've never really wanted to do anything else
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.660]   except help develop that type of therapeutic
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.380]   for another kind of symptom.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.920]   I'm very interested in obesity and related eating disorders,
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.600]   compulsive behavior, the urge to have something
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.880]   that might be delicious, but dangerous, or unhealthy,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   or a drug, or a compulsion like we see in OCD,
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.000]   or obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.240]   Interestingly, like we see tremor melt away
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.960]   when we deliver electricity to a certain part of the brain,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.120]   we can see these psychiatric, more psychiatric problems,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.560]   they're not all psychiatric disorders,
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.140]   but let's say disorders of the brain,
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.600]   we can see symptoms of those disorders also improve
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.320]   and often immediately, just like we do with tremor.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.700]   So I see it all the time.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.060]   To pick out one would be a challenge
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.760]   because for me, this is my everyday.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.360]   - The speed of the relief that you described for tremor
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.460]   is really incredible.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.940]   Just thinking about drug therapies
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.920]   and there too, there are side effects,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.880]   but there are still a lot of mysteries
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.120]   as to, for instance, why SSRIs even work when they work.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.640]   - Yes, the timing is always a challenge.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.760]   Timing, dosage, yes, absolutely.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.300]   I'd love to learn more from you about OCD.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.140]   I have several reasons for asking this.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.400]   First of all, I'm a somewhat obsessive person.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.960]   I tend to be very narrowly focused,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.160]   although I confess it's not a step function.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.920]   It takes me some time to turn off the chatter,
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.800]   but once I'm into a thought train or a mode of being
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.600]   and thinking and work,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.920]   it's very hard for me to exit that mode.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.000]   It's like a deep trench.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.520]   Adaptive in some circumstances, less adaptive.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.640]   In others, as you know.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.280]   The other is that when I was a kid,
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.600]   I had a little bit of a grunting tic.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.620]   I used to, I had this intense, intense desire
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.640]   to clear my throat to the point where my dad said,
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.600]   you need to stop that.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.220]   He used to squeeze my hand every time I do it.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.920]   And I used to hide in the backseat of the car
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.000]   or in the closet to do it
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.460]   because it provided so much relief.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.800]   And then it eventually passed.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.760]   I wasn't medicated.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.400]   They never did anything about it.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.760]   Every once in a while now,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.040]   if I'm very fatigued, if I've been working a lot,
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.000]   I notice it starts to come back.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.680]   I'll do this like kind of grunting.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.880]   And so it's been sort of like a pet neurological symptom
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.280]   for me that reminds me that these circuits exist
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.920]   in all of us and that sometimes they go haywire
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.440]   and sometimes they just have subtle, you know,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.840]   overexcitation or something of that sort.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.600]   And then the third reason is that I get thousands
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.160]   of questions about OCD.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.940]   - Could you perhaps just tell us what is OCD?
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.120]   - Sure.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.160]   - What are some brain areas involved?
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.720]   What are the current range of treatments?
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.800]   And what's the difference between someone who is obsessive
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.840]   and somebody who has true OCD?
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.600]   - So a brief disclosure, as a neurosurgeon,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.720]   I do take care of patients
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.280]   with severe obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.660]   But my perspective on OCD may be a little bit different
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.200]   than a psychiatrist who lives and breathes OCD
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.020]   and sees patients every single day with OCD.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.160]   I probably take care of three to five patients a year
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.200]   with deep brain stimulation
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.280]   for obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.120]   So I don't see these patients as routinely,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.760]   but my laboratory is geared as a researcher.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.120]   I'm very focused on trying to improve outcomes
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.760]   of deep brain stimulation for OCD.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.780]   So I do feel I have expertise and a perspective to share,
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.440]   but just a brief disclosure.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:46.040]   I do feel that as a neurosurgeon,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.600]   I am obligated to better understand
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.840]   where the obsessions in the brain come from
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.560]   and how we can interrupt them to stop the compulsion
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.240]   that's associated with the obsession,
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.160]   sort of the intrinsic most feature of OCD,
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.440]   better than we're actually doing it.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   For example, if we were to offer a patient
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.160]   with tremor deep brain stimulation surgery,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.000]   of course there's some risk to the procedure,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.760]   but the outcome is so consistent and positive
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.400]   that many patients are willing to take on that risk.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.600]   For obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.840]   the surgery risk is about the same.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.520]   However, the benefit is not quite as robust.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.060]   And so a lot of patients and their referring psychiatrists
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.740]   are reluctant to refer these patients to us,
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.160]   and it's completely understandable.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.540]   I've been leading an endeavor
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.280]   with a number of collaborators around the country
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.280]   to try to better understand these circuits in the brain,
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.540]   study them in humans, both invasively and non-invasively.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.180]   That would be with an electrode-based surgery,
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.320]   sort of like we do in epilepsy
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.140]   to understand where seizures come from.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.220]   We wanna understand better where obsessions come from,
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.800]   but we're also working with imaging experts and geneticists
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.460]   to understand OCD at a broader level as well.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:11.960]   I consider OCD to be a spectrum disorder in a way.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.140]   And I apologize to those who might feel
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.960]   that I'm using that term incorrectly.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.260]   I'm using it in a way to describe patients
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.060]   that have obsessions and even some related compulsions
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.080]   might not meet criteria for OCD.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.500]   It may be something, Andrew, that you have.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.060]   And as a neurosurgeon, I'm really obsessive about safety
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.560]   and compulsive about my surgical procedures.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.020]   So I think that some aspect of OCD,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.100]   which we often joke about, but we should consider seriously,
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.560]   'cause people do suffer from this,
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.780]   some aspect of it helps us.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.780]   There are famous CEOs that probably have some level of OCD,
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.500]   surgeons and scientists alike.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.540]   So perhaps if it can be controlled, it's an asset.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.060]   But if it goes awry and is uncontrollable,
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.980]   then it becomes obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.620]   And I tend to see the patients that are the most severe,
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.460]   so they have failed medication.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.180]   And there are multiple medications
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.540]   that are worth trying for OCD.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.540]   Some can actually be very helpful.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.380]   - Which neurotransmitter systems do they tend to poke at?
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.480]   - Well, SSRIs are sort of the first line for OCD,
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.180]   but also tricyclics can be helpful.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.060]   So this is still the serotonin system.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.000]   But as we know, the serotonin system interacts
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.140]   with the neurodegenergic system and the dopamine system.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.140]   So it's hard to be specific to one of these things.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.580]   And I think that's also why it's hard for us to predict
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.740]   how these medications are going to work
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.140]   for these kinds of patients.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.220]   But tricyclics and SSRIs can be very helpful
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.980]   and are definitely first line.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.880]   And there's others, exposure response prevention
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.740]   is probably the most effective option,
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.640]   which is kind of like cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.200]   but these are different and offered by psychologists.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.120]   And this is a whole field.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.820]   And there's a field, or I should say,
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.680]   a whole clinic at my institution focused,
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.280]   it was started by Ed Nafoa at Penn,
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.180]   who this is what they do for these patients,
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.980]   is offer these types of cognitive therapies,
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.620]   exposure to the stressor and to try to get patients
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.940]   to habituate to whatever it is that stresses them
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.620]   and causes these compulsions
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.140]   to help these patients live in every day and function.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.000]   These are all fabulously helpful therapies
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.340]   for a variety of patients,
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.640]   but there's still about 30% of patients
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.340]   that still suffer from OCD.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.220]   And some of them have severe OCD.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.020]   Sometimes it's moderate to severe.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.700]   And those are the patients that I'm really motivated
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.420]   to try to help.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   Our therapies for those patients right now,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:59.240]   I would say are worth pursuing, but not optimal.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.940]   And so it's one of those things
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.420]   that we have to balance as a researcher,
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.520]   because when you see patients like this,
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.780]   you wanna do everything you can to help them.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.060]   And I think it's important to educate patients
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.640]   on the risks and benefits of them.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.560]   This is deep brain stimulation surgery,
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.780]   but also capsulotomy,
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.840]   which is more of an ablation approach,
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.520]   a little bit like deep brain stimulation,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.080]   but rather than delivering stimulation through an electrode,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.200]   you can actually heat the tissue and even destroy it.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.660]   Some would say this part of the brain
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.140]   is very safe to destroy.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.640]   It's kind of like an appendix.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.480]   Others would say it's safer to modulate.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.000]   I have seen patients do very well with these ablations.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.240]   And so, you asked me earlier
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.160]   what I find so amazing about the brain,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.420]   these effects that we can have.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.680]   Sometimes the lack of effect is what's so amazing.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.900]   You can actually traverse parts of the brain
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.200]   without having any adverse effects on patients' function,
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.440]   at least that you can test,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.440]   but you can also destroy small parts of the brain.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.680]   We're talking three or four millimeters in size.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.440]   These little ablations can be really helpful for patients,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.160]   but have no obvious side effects that we can tell,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.080]   perhaps after a short recovery from surgery.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.800]   But nonetheless, despite how safe they might be,
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.080]   these surgical procedures still are surgical procedures,
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.640]   and patients are hesitant to proceed,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.320]   especially when they know that their chance
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.840]   of a transformative effect is quite low.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   We can generally achieve a responder rate of about 50%.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.240]   And responders still have symptomatic OCD.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   So I'm really sort of inspired to really find a way
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.900]   to deliver these therapies in a more disease-specific
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.720]   or symptom-specific way.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   But we're years away probably from that therapy,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.620]   since it's all part of a research study at the moment.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.080]   - What brain areas should I think about
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.160]   when I think about OCD?
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.640]   Years ago, I remember opening a textbook,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.480]   I think I was an undergraduate still,
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.400]   and work from Judith Rappaport
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.040]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.120]   this would be late '80s, early '90s,
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.180]   had done some neuroimaging, or maybe it was PET,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.040]   or some other imaging technique,
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.020]   and had identified portions of the basal ganglia,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.200]   caudate putatum-type structures in OCD,
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.680]   and maybe some differences in boys versus girls.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.040]   So what brain areas?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.440]   Are there sex differences in terms of OCD?
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.160]   And were one to come into your clinic
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.160]   for this sort of a work of ablations or stimulation,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.640]   where would you first start to probe in the brain?
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   - Yeah, this is a disorder of both cortex and the subcortex.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:40.440]   The cortical control areas,
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.880]   areas that are involved in inhibitory control,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.960]   we have found to not function properly in patients with OCD,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.120]   so areas like the overall frontal cortex
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.920]   and the prefrontal cortex.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.520]   If you image these areas,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.000]   or study them even in a rodent model of OCD,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   which, quite honestly, these models,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.920]   they model aspects of OCD, but OCD is a human condition.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.640]   You can't really model this whole condition
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.080]   in a mouse or a rat,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.360]   but perhaps you can model compulsive behavior in a rat, sure.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.440]   - Pulling out their hair.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.200]   You know, that's not necessarily obsessive compulsive
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.120]   disorder, but that is compulsive behavior.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.640]   And perhaps if you can ameliorate that in a rat,
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.440]   that might be helpful for a patient with OCD,
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.920]   but we have to approach animal modeling of OCD thoughtfully.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.400]   And most scientists do, I think.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.800]   And when we study OCD in models or in humans with imaging,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.880]   and we're trying to do it invasively with electrodes
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.000]   like we do in epilepsy patients,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.160]   we find that areas in the cortex like the prefrontal
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.440]   and over-frontal cortex are not functioning
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.360]   the way they would in a non-OCD patient.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.400]   They're often hyper-functioning,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.440]   such that while you might say,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.360]   well, they're hyper-functioning,
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   so aren't these patients functioning better?
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.200]   - Hyper-focused.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   - Yeah, hyper-focused, exactly.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.760]   No, I would say it's not so much an up or a down.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.560]   It's more that they're just dysfunctional.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.120]   And we need to find a way
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.960]   to try to restore normal function to these areas.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.120]   It's not so much directional, really.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.920]   We tend to oversimplify brain function
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.200]   by thinking about it with directionality too much.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.120]   Unfortunately, imaging studies sometimes demonstrate
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.160]   activation or hypoactivation,
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.960]   and that's where I think these kinds of things
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.320]   can be misconstrued.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.200]   But what I would call the cortical areas of OCD
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.840]   is that they're dysregulated,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.720]   and we need to find a way
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.600]   to try to normalize their function.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   So the frontal lobe is huge,
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.840]   but areas of the frontal lobe that are a bit more basal,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.800]   like the OFC, or orbital frontal cortex,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.240]   and the prefrontal cortex
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.680]   definitely consistently seem to be implicated
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.800]   in patients with OCD.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   And then there are projections to the subcortex.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.960]   This is the basal ganglia, like you were saying.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.120]   Caudate putamen, or the dorsal striatum,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.040]   and these are interconnected with the ventral striatum.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.880]   This is an area of the brain
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.040]   that I focus a lot of my energy in.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   This is the ventral striatum,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.560]   which is not limited to,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.660]   but includes the nucleus accumbens.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.960]   This is an area of the brain
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.120]   that we know to be involved
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.140]   in gating reward-seeking behavior.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:05.980]   When it's perturbed,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.920]   it seems to gate compulsive behavior,
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.860]   meaning a rat will pursue a reward despite punishment,
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.860]   despite foot shock, for example,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.780]   and that can be similar to an OCD patient.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.400]   They will check their home for safety
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.980]   until 3 a.m. in the morning and not sleep that night.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.960]   In a way, that is similar
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.420]   to a rat seeking out a food reward despite a foot shock,
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.220]   doing something because of the urge, but despite the risk.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:37.220]   And perhaps there is some normal judgment there.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.180]   We all have to take risks to function in everyday society.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.280]   To be successful, we have to take a risk.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.840]   To take care of patients with surgery,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.200]   there's some risk there.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.140]   We make a judgment call,
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.080]   and that's not a condition.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.080]   That's just normal.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   But when our judgment consistently sort of puts us at risk,
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.680]   that's where we have something like OCD.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.960]   But OCD is also, you know,
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.600]   it's one of many conditions
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.100]   that suffer from these kinds of problems.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.640]   We tend to label them
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.880]   because they tend to present in a consistent way.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.320]   So we have patients with OCD
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.040]   that have hyper-checking behavior
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.840]   or contamination behavior where if they feel contaminated,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.080]   they will wash their hands for hours repeatedly,
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   or if they drop their toothbrush on the floor,
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.300]   this will lead to a compulsive behavior
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.760]   of cleaning a toothbrush
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.400]   and brushing your teeth consistently.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.480]   Very, very common symptoms that we see
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.660]   or signs that the patients report to us or that we observe.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.880]   But, you know, patients with eating disorders,
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.600]   they tend to, if they have binging disorder,
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.640]   they'll overeat.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.560]   If they have bulimia, they might purge
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.400]   despite the risk of these things.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.180]   And so addiction is similar.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.940]   We tend to drug seek if we're addicted.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.720]   We'll pay off a dealer in order to get our fix
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.840]   despite the risk.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.680]   And that type of urge, despite the risk,
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.780]   is something that I've always been really interested in.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.840]   And it's a common denominator to all of these problems.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.240]   And if you think about these problems,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.520]   I mean, these are some of the most common conditions
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.160]   in our society today.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.560]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.600]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.060]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.440]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.320]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.000]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.200]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.800]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.860]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.840]   once or usually twice a day
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.760]   is that it gets me the probiotics
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.440]   that I need for gut health.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.600]   Our gut is very important.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.100]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.860]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.260]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.900]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.760]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.600]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.160]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.060]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.940]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.400]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.840]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.240]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.220]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.540]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.120]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.520]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.200]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.580]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.640]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.840]   - Yeah, I really appreciate that you're building
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.940]   this bridge from OCD to nucleus accumbens,
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.240]   which is, of course, associated with reward in various forms,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.940]   and we'll get to that.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.940]   I'll share a personal anecdote as a form of question.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.600]   When I was in college and studying a lot,
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.800]   I relied on caffeine as a stimulant.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.540]   I've never really been into drugs or alcohol.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.760]   I've been lucky in that sense.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.080]   I don't drink, and I care less if alcohol disappeared.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.680]   Never really liked recreational drugs,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.780]   so I was never drawn to them.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.580]   However, when I was in college,
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.220]   at the time, there were these little epinephrine pills
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.640]   that were common in a lot of sports supplements.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.120]   These were like pre-workout type things.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.520]   Not unlike energy drinks now, which I completely avoid.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.500]   And I had this experience of taking one of these
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.620]   and drinking some coffee,
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.320]   and of course, it gave me a lift in energy.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.160]   These are very similar to amphetamine.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.120]   They were legal over the counter at the time.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.400]   They're now either banned or illegal.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.040]   I do not recommend them.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.280]   And I had a lot of energy,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.560]   but what I noticed is that my grunting came back,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.220]   and I had, I made one mistake.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.800]   I still think of this as one mistake,
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.040]   which was I engaged in a superstitious behavior.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.600]   I knocked on wood.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.740]   And then somehow it felt very rewarding.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.400]   Like it gave me some totally irrational,
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.080]   but internally rational sense of security around.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.920]   I forget what I was knocking on wood about.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.320]   And I found that I couldn't break
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.760]   that knock on wood compulsion.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.680]   I felt I needed to knock on wood.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.520]   And so then I started sneaking knock on woods,
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.140]   like in mid-exam and studying.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.760]   And pretty soon I was knocking on wood often.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.760]   I developed a superstition.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   And so I'm curious about the role of superstition
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.760]   and compulsion and the crossover there.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.000]   It makes sense logically to me,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.580]   but I was equally shocked to learn
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.320]   that when I stopped taking this stimulant,
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.880]   which I was quite happy to stop
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.180]   because it did make me feel too alert,
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.160]   couldn't sleep well, et cetera,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.880]   that the superstition went away as well.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.320]   And I'm guessing this has something to do
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.380]   with some of the reward circuitry,
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.460]   as it's called, related to stimulants.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.780]   Again, I am not encouraging anyone to take stimulants,
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.340]   although healthy use of caffeine or safe use of caffeine
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.160]   might be the one universally accepted stimulant.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.320]   It was really surprising to me how quickly this came on,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.960]   how quickly it engaged my thinking and my behavior,
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.920]   the obsessions and the compulsions,
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.100]   and how quickly it turned off
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.120]   when I stopped taking this sports stimulant
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.960]   or whatever it was.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.780]   I don't even remember.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.560]   I think it was some form of epinephrine, ephedrine.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.400]   - Sure.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.840]   - It's not epinephrine, excuse me, I misspoke, ephedrine.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.220]   Does what I described sound totally outside
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   the bounds of logic or am I imagining it all?
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.440]   - No. - It did happen.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.400]   I'm certain it happened.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.900]   - Yeah, no, I don't think you're imagining it at all.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.940]   You know, the grunting that you mentioned to me,
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.900]   first of all, I didn't comment,
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.900]   but that sort of, not to put a label on it,
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.300]   but it sounds like a tick,
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.680]   and ticks in young males, extremely common,
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.100]   and they do tend to go away.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.940]   - Blinking ticks like this. - Exactly.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.300]   - I have a good friend who,
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.700]   actually a famous neuroscientist,
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.820]   I won't mention who it is,
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.060]   who's worked very hard to suppress his blinking ticks,
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.100]   and when he gets fatigued, it comes back,
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.300]   and he's very high functioning in his personal life
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.740]   and his professional life.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.700]   But when you're talking to him and he starts doing this,
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.740]   you kind of start wondering what's going on.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.420]   - Yeah, and it's unfortunate,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.740]   people with these problems,
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.020]   especially as they get more severe
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.200]   than you get Tourette syndrome,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.580]   it's hard to function in our society.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.420]   I have some friends that have Tourette,
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.200]   and I'll tell you, I'm just so inspired
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.620]   because they're so confident,
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.540]   and people obviously notice these problems,
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.640]   but they just live their life and they're very successful,
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.200]   and that's not typical.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.700]   I have friends that I went to Penn with undergrad
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.860]   that had these kinds of problems,
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.100]   and I was always just so happy and inspired by them,
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.740]   but what's more typical is these problems
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.340]   cause people to lose their confidence
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:35.340]   and not pursue their profession as they may have done
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.360]   or things of that nature.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.020]   So I think it's all related to the fact that we,
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.480]   our brains are very vulnerable,
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.540]   and to get back to your question about the stimulant,
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.380]   you know, I think your brain was very vulnerable to it.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.060]   You know, you sort of may have had a predisposition to it.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.660]   You mentioned that you're a little obsessive,
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.260]   and with the tick there, maybe you have this kind of,
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.940]   you know, on the mild side of the spectrum OCD,
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.720]   and I probably do as well, by the way,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.620]   so I also have avoided drugs for that reason in my life.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.100]   I'll drink a little bit of wine here and there,
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.580]   but that's about it,
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.500]   but I think most people don't avoid these things,
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.540]   and we see these problems in relation
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.620]   to not just taking a stimulant,
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.800]   but any kind of environmental exposure.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.180]   Our own society causes so much stress,
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.460]   and that's why I think we have these human conditions.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.200]   These are human conditions.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.180]   We try to model them in animals,
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.180]   but most animals don't have these kinds of problems.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.780]   I've heard that an animal like a monkey in the wild
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.580]   can have depression, a monkey's version of depression,
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.980]   but I don't think it's really typical or human depression,
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.700]   you know, and certainly it's not as prevalent
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.260]   as depression is in our human society.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.640]   I think, you know, we haven't evolved to manage the stresses
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.220]   that are in this society that we currently have,
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.220]   and stimulants is probably one of them, you know,
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.160]   and I suspect you were probably a little bit vulnerable.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.900]   It's possible the stimulant led to an overdrive
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.900]   of your prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.140]   and even brought out a little OCD behavior
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.960]   related to this superstition that you had,
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.360]   so no, I believe that entirely,
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.520]   and I also think, you know, that's why things like OCD
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.280]   and other kinds of psychiatric disorders
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.080]   tend to present themselves in college
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.540]   when people leave their home and they're in school
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.580]   and they're stressed and they're getting exposed to things
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.380]   that they haven't been exposed to before
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.980]   outside of the home, and, you know,
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.880]   their brains aren't evolved and sophisticated enough yet
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.160]   to help them cope with these kinds of stresses
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.140]   and how it manifests is in these kinds of conditions,
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.200]   and I don't want to put a label on those conditions,
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.740]   but certainly it could be a psychiatric disorder,
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.900]   but it could also just be lots of anxiety.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.380]   It could also be the kind of problems that you had as well.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.940]   So, and I think the nucleus accumbens
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.260]   and the cortical areas that we've been discussing
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.940]   that sort of send projections to these areas
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.680]   are probably at least one of the main circuits
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.380]   involved in these kinds of things.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.060]   - Well, I'm relieved it's no longer present,
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.400]   but I confess it, I always feel it close by.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.940]   A long run helps.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.200]   So, you know, being a slightly fatigued,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.120]   not overly fatigued, but slightly fatigued
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.400]   seems to move out the kind of physical compulsion,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.360]   but tried to channel it.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.980]   Never taken any medication for it, and here I am,
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.200]   so I'm still going.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.520]   I may call you for a referral at some point,
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.220]   but at this point I'm feeling okay.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.640]   Let's talk about nucleus accumbens and reward circuitry
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   and the relationship between OCD, reward, addiction,
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.520]   and to just give you a sense of where I'm headed with this
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.220]   is into the realm of food-related
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.640]   and eating-related behaviors and disorders,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.360]   because I know you're doing some very important work there.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.940]   What is nucleus accumbens?
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.020]   I know we all have one, or two,
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.320]   one on each side of the brain.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.220]   What is it, what roles does it play
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.120]   in healthy brain behavior and in pathology?
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.840]   - Yeah, the nucleus accumbens is a part of the brain,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.800]   part of our reward circuits,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.240]   the hub of the reward circuits
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.120]   that I've always been most fascinated in.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.500]   There are scientists around the world,
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.800]   some of the leading,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.200]   arguably some of the leading scientists in the world,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.000]   the father of addiction neuroscience, I call him,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.320]   although he tells me I'm nuts, Rob Malenka,
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.840]   who has studied the nucleus accumbens
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.600]   since the beginning of his career
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.480]   and who I worked with when I was at Stanford.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.080]   Fabulous scientist and mentor,
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.920]   taught me so much, taught the world so much.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.600]   - Incredible person, scientist and physician as well.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.360]   - Yes, MD, PhD, and brilliant in both ways,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.960]   and very fatherly in a lot of ways
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.520]   in terms of teaching people how to do science
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.700]   and be good citizens as well.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:56.960]   But the nucleus accumbens is an area
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.560]   that is also very complicated
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.300]   because it has a lot of functions.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:05.380]   It interconnects with many parts of the brain.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.160]   But there are some things about the nucleus accumbens
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.480]   that are very consistent.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.840]   So when I started getting interested in reward
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.160]   and what I could do as a surgeon
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.960]   to try to improve how we manage rewards,
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.040]   and what I mean by that specifically is
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.040]   if you have an urge for a reward,
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.960]   that's a normal phenomenon.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.940]   That's not something we're trying to stop.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.760]   The issue is if you have an urge for a reward
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.040]   that either puts you or somebody else at risk,
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.420]   it's probably a reward we shouldn't have.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.260]   I suppose you could say,
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.600]   well, it depends on the size of the reward
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.560]   and the size of the risk
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.980]   and how that fits into your societal norms.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.240]   But for example, if you're obese
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.880]   and you have a doctor who is advising that you lose weight
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.020]   and try to control your eating habits,
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.760]   perhaps better food choices is an important way
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.760]   for you to be healthier.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.160]   And not pursuing those better food choices,
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.940]   that's an urge that we probably need to treat.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:13.040]   If you're a drug addict and you use heroin or opiate,
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.220]   considering the opiate crisis right now, or cocaine,
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.400]   which is untreatable at the moment,
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:26.320]   that cocaine might make you feel
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.220]   like you have some more energy that day
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.560]   to deal with your work,
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.200]   or that opiate might make you feel better
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.540]   'cause life is stressful.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.760]   But the risk of doing those things is really high,
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.460]   in fact, potentially lethal.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.640]   So that's an urge that's treatable.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   If you have OCD and you can't sleep at night
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.760]   because you're so nervous that you didn't lock the door
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.440]   and you've checked 30 times,
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:54.800]   that's a reality for some people with severe OCD.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.040]   That's an urge we gotta treat.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.440]   Eating disorder's the same.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.880]   Eating disorders and obesity are obviously linked
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.780]   because of the relationship of a patient with food,
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.320]   but they're also quite distinct.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.780]   Not everybody with obesity has an eating disorder,
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.800]   and obviously not everybody
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.480]   with an eating disorder has obesity.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.440]   I'm particularly interested in patients
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.160]   that have binge eating disorder as well as obesity
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.800]   because they're so heavily linked.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.280]   Not everybody with binge eating disorder has obesity,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.260]   but on average, most are overweight.
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.320]   We are doing a deep brain stimulation trial at Penn
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.200]   where we're trying to modulate the nucleus accumbens
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.740]   and understand it better in patients
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.480]   that have failed gastric bypass surgery,
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.840]   the most aggressive form of treatment for obesity.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.760]   And we believe they failed gastric bypass surgery
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.560]   because of binge eating disorder,
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.600]   meaning they just can't control how much they eat.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   So their obesity is either related or even due to overeating,
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.360]   not some predisposition to that body habitus.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.240]   You know, obesity is a phenotype, something that we can see.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.180]   Not everybody is obese because of the same thing.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.120]   So it's very important.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.400]   I was taught this by a close mentor and friend, Tom Wadden,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.360]   when he was the director of the obesity center at Penn
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.880]   or the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.480]   And he said to me, "You know, Casey,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.080]   "be careful with obesity.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.600]   "You're interested in addiction,
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.160]   "and I understand you're interested
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.400]   "in the addictive tendencies of certain patients
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   "with obesity and their relationship with food."
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.840]   But not everybody with obesity has that problem.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.880]   And in fact, it's probably present
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.860]   in about 20% of patients with obesity.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.800]   But now taking a step back,
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.500]   20% of patients with obesity is still a massive problem
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.160]   of epidemic proportions.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.200]   And perhaps some of these patients
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.760]   have either some form of binge eating disorder,
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.560]   or I should say some degree of binge eating disorder,
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   or at least loss of control eating,
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.900]   which is common to both.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.680]   So that's a feature that I think eating disorder experts,
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.040]   obesity experts, neurosurgeons,
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.760]   obesity medicine experts would agree is common
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.040]   to eating disorders and obesity.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.480]   And I also believe is common to addicts
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.280]   and perhaps patients with OCD
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.340]   is sort of a loss of control disorder.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:14.480]   It's actually not a disorder known by like the DSM-5,
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.140]   some diagnostic manual,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.760]   but a feature I should say of these conditions
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.640]   that's common.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:24.640]   And that common denominator I believe can be restored,
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.840]   or at least this problem can be ameliorated
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.000]   or improved upon by a better understanding
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.300]   and a tailored treatment
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.200]   to the nucleus accumbens specifically.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.540]   We have learned in mice that if you expose a mouse,
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.960]   now this is just a model,
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.780]   if you expose a mouse to high fat food,
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.320]   not food that they would normally eat,
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.520]   food that is like 60% fat, high fat, it's like butter.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.520]   We've learned that if you expose them to food like that,
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.840]   within two weeks, their nucleus accumbens is not functioning
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.560]   like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.880]   There's aspects of it that are hyperactive, I could say,
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.920]   and there's aspects of it that are hypoactive
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.840]   or decreased activity.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.360]   But either way, it's not functioning properly.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.040]   And most likely that function
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.920]   is predisposing continued behavior.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.040]   And then probably eventually leads to things like a habit
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.900]   that gets developed.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.440]   And that's a whole nother area of these kinds of problems
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.600]   that is very complicated and poorly understood.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.960]   But in any case, if we just focus on the behavior at hand,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.000]   it seems that repeated exposure
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.520]   to something like high fat food, a drug of abuse,
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.520]   or any type of reward that is a really strong reward,
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.720]   in a way it can hijack normal functioning
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.620]   of the nucleus accumbens.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.680]   So the goal of our invasive trial
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.720]   is to try to restore normal functioning
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.900]   to that nucleus accumbens.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.160]   In mice, there seems to be a signal
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.440]   that predicts when they're going to lose control.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.720]   And we can use that signal to deliver
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.880]   a sort of a real-time therapy
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.260]   in the form of deep brain stimulation,
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.280]   just a brief amount of stimulation.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.480]   And that actually blocks the behavior.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.620]   And what's interesting is over time,
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.780]   that signal actually decreases in frequency,
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:12.560]   which suggests some level of restoring normal function
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.680]   to that circuit in a mouse.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.560]   And we're trying to do that now in a human trial.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.640]   - Fascinating.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.320]   Where is the stimulation provided?
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.040]   Because I would imagine that if one were
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.560]   to stimulate nucleus accumbens,
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.800]   you would see a reinforcement
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.420]   of whatever behavior coincided or preceded the stimulation.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:35.160]   - So the stimulation, it's a brief delivery of stimulation,
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.320]   anywhere between five and 10 seconds,
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:42.320]   that is intended to just disrupt the perturbed signaling
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.140]   that's happening in the nucleus accumbens.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:49.100]   There are disorders like depression, let's say,
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.420]   that I would describe as a bit more of a state disorder.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.740]   And this is obviously oversimplified
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.580]   because we know that there's fluctuations
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.800]   in mood and depression as well.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.460]   So don't let me oversimplify it too much.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.160]   But for now, let's forgive the oversimplification.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.680]   If we accept that depression is a state disorder,
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.240]   or maybe Parkinson's disease is a state disorder,
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.000]   recognizing that they do fluctuate,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.120]   these types of problems most likely, but not definitely,
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.280]   most likely need a continuous therapy of some form,
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.480]   a therapy that's consistent,
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.840]   perhaps a therapy that fluctuates with the condition,
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.480]   but nevertheless still consistent.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:34.080]   Binge eating disorder or OCD or addiction,
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.960]   and binging disorder in the context of obesity.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.920]   A lot of these patients are functioning quite normally
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.760]   every single day.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.000]   It's just that intermittently throughout the day,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.820]   there's brief interruptions in their normal function,
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.500]   such that they have thoughts about food
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.980]   or the drug of abuse that they're really longing to have.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.620]   And so we wanna deliver a episodic therapy
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:59.260]   delivered at the right time and only at the right time
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:04.260]   to try to interrupt the circuit aberration
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.940]   or the problem at hand
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.060]   that is gonna lead to that dangerous behavior
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.860]   and to kind of get the patient back on track
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.960]   to what they're doing.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:18.580]   I don't necessarily think that it leads to a reinforcement.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.540]   It's possible, we have to study that more,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.900]   but rather the goal is to just disrupt
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.100]   perhaps what is kind of habitual
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:33.100]   or at least this kind of recurring problem that is happening.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.820]   People that have binging disorder,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:35.900]   at least at a severe level,
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.980]   they tend to binge about once a day,
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.700]   but they don't binge all day long, of course.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.460]   They have a moment perhaps when they get home from work
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.740]   and they're stressed
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:48.260]   where they might have a bout of binge.
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.780]   - What constitutes a binge?
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.100]   And I also want to know,
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.100]   does binge eating disorder come on suddenly,
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.820]   meaning as an entire disorder?
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.560]   One day, people wake up,
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.940]   suddenly they have binging disorder,
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.580]   or is this a few too many buffets?
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.260]   And I'm being entirely serious here,
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:10.100]   you know, unlimited food and a circuit gets flipped
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.860]   or kind of starts moving into the high RPMs, so to speak.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.700]   So how does it come on?
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:20.320]   And I'm actually surprised to hear that it's once a day.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.460]   I would think just hearing binging disorder,
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.700]   I assumed it's like OCD,
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.420]   which it probably fluctuates across the day as well.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.100]   But I would have thought anytime people around food,
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.020]   they just simply can't control their intake of food.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:31.980]   - Yes.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.060]   - So what does this look like
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.340]   in terms of the onset of the disorder?
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.440]   And then what do you think underlies this
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.980]   once a day type of phenomenon?
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.140]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:43.420]   - Yeah, so severe binging disorder,
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.540]   these patients will binge about once a day.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.600]   It could be a couple of times a day,
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.300]   but in general, it's not more than that.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.140]   Moderate is about three to four times a week, for example.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:56.300]   The reason I think that that seems surprising to you
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.980]   and if you think about it, it is surprising.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.220]   But, and I agree with you,
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.500]   but the reason for that
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.420]   is actually just in the definitions of the word.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.920]   And as a neurosurgeon in full disclosure, as I mentioned,
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.020]   I don't see these patients clinically.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.500]   I see them for research trial purposes
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.060]   and I try to understand the literature
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.180]   around eating disorders.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.580]   And I obviously collaborate
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:23.120]   with fabulous eating disorders in these problems
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.080]   that are highly innovative people.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.240]   But the word binge is a definition.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.800]   There's a definition to that word
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.640]   and you can't necessarily binge all day
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   because our stomachs are not big enough.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.880]   And so there's a limit to how much one can eat.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.440]   And to meet criteria for a binge,
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.600]   you have to have a sense of loss of control.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.740]   You have to eat an enormous amount of food
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.920]   in a brief period of time.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.120]   And yes, generally that doesn't happen
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.800]   more than about once a day
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.100]   in a patient with severe binge eating disorder.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.480]   However, they can lose control quite often.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.640]   And in fact, perhaps even at every meal,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.600]   they might meet criteria for a bout of loss of control
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.280]   where they, yes, they may have lost control,
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.360]   but they might not have eaten enough
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.200]   to constitute what we would define as a binge.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.800]   And that would be,
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.920]   there's no specific number to that by the way.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.320]   It's really just compared to their normal meal.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   Perhaps it's 50% of their daily calories
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.300]   in that one brief moment.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:29.280]   So that's why I think it seems surprising
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.360]   that binges aren't happening more often than that.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.480]   What I would say is if we replace the term binge
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.080]   with loss of control eating,
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:40.700]   loss of control eating could happen dozens of times a week.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.560]   And in fact, the patients that we're studying,
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.240]   we've seen patients that lose control 20, 30 times a week.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.400]   And that's probably the term you have in mind
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.880]   when you're surprised that it's just one time a day.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.340]   And it's specifically related to the fact
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:56.040]   that these patients have to eat such a large amount of food
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.480]   in such a brief period of time.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.200]   So it's hard to do that more than once a day.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.040]   - I see.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.620]   You mentioned that some preexisting anxiety
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.840]   might bias somebody to have a binge.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.800]   I'm also fascinated by something I've observed before,
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.880]   which is when I was in college,
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.040]   my girlfriend had a roommate who we were aware was bulimic
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.480]   and would binge and then purge.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.180]   And often when she ingested alcohol,
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.480]   that would lead to a binge.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.320]   - Sure.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.460]   - Which is kind of the opposite of anxiety
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.020]   when I think about alcohol as something
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.960]   that slightly reduces prefrontal activity,
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.080]   somewhat of a sedative
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.680]   or certainly a set of higher dosages.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.860]   So this brings to something that you said,
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.580]   I'm just going to, I won't say it as eloquently
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:43.440]   as you did that.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.560]   It seems like it's neither the case
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.040]   that anxiety leads to binging
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.840]   nor that hypo reduced activation of the forebrain
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.120]   and lower anxiety leads to binging.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.520]   It's this dysregulation of circuitry
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   that the seesaw could go either way
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.140]   and it can throw things off.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.040]   It's off balance in both cases.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:02.880]   - Yes.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:08.240]   - And that seems to be, that seems to pose a problem.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.040]   It seems like it's a particularly tricky problem
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.200]   and kind of explains to me in my nonclinical awareness
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.180]   why medication might be really hard to use
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.020]   as a way to treat this,
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.960]   but that being able to poke around in the brain
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.640]   and assay in real time, you know, how do you feel?
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.620]   Do you feel like binging now
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.500]   or do you feel further from the binge impulse?
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.840]   Is that what you do with these patients?
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.880]   Are they awake while you're stimulating the brain?
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.780]   'Cause it's one thing to say,
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.400]   I stimulate a brain area and the binging goes away
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.800]   or partial relief or complete relief,
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.860]   but how do you know?
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:44.100]   Are they in there with a donut and you're tempting them?
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:47.300]   So how do you actually know if a bleeding of brain area
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.760]   is going to lead to a relief or exacerbation
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.260]   or no impact on this disorder?
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:57.840]   - Yeah, so there's a lot to unpack there.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.480]   I'll try to go one step at a time.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.320]   And if I miss something, please remind me.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.960]   - No, and I tend to ask these three-part questions
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.100]   specifically of neurosurgeons
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.140]   because I like to challenge you guys.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.220]   'Cause again, you are the astronauts of neuroscience.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.500]   Also, I'm just going to take a moment to poke at neurosurgeons
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.660]   'cause I have a couple close friends who are neurosurgeons
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:14.920]   and I consider Casey a friend.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.080]   I don't know if he considers me a friend,
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.520]   but I consider him a friend.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.400]   I'm teasing there too, which is, first of all,
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.700]   they all have incredible hands, right?
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:24.280]   They have, I'm not, they all guard their hands
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.960]   with the kind of protection that you would guard,
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.680]   the tools of, the most important tools of your trade.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.040]   So they're very careful with their hands.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.500]   You're not going to see them doing heavy deadlifts.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.060]   You're not because of the way that impacts the motor neurons.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.940]   It's all about fine control.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.840]   So if your neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts,
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.740]   you might want to consider getting a different neurosurgeon.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.220]   Hope I didn't put anyone out of work there.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:52.220]   And then the other thing is that you all
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:55.100]   tend to be very calm people, at least on the exterior.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:56.440]   We'll return to this later.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.500]   But I do throw three or four questions out at once.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:03.340]   So elevated autonomic arousal and alertness,
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.700]   as well as decreased autonomic arousal and alertness,
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.500]   both seem to be able to lead to binging.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.980]   And then there's this question of how do you know
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.920]   whether or not to stimulate or to ablate
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.720]   or whether or not to leave a structure alone?
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.160]   In other words, what does one of these experiments
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.280]   look like in the laboratory?
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.480]   - Yeah, sort of a-
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.380]   - Clinic, excuse me.
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.220]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.340]   Yeah, these are questions I think about all the time.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:29.160]   And I do want to come back to the deadlifting comment,
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:34.160]   but regarding, and you referred to this earlier as well,
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.120]   and I don't know if I addressed it sufficiently either,
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.020]   is sort of like what comes first here
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.400]   or how does this develop?
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.860]   I think, first of all,
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:48.700]   I like to understand these kinds of problems
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.740]   in sort of the construct of what I consider to be
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.700]   a bit of a two-hit hypothesis.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.620]   So you sort of need, like in the concussion literature,
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.840]   you need, the second hit can be devastating.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.880]   So if you have a concussion, you wanna only return to play
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.180]   when your symptoms are gone and cleared by a physician.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.600]   So in the context of eating disorders,
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.880]   or let's say binge eating disorder,
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.500]   and first of all, I didn't mention earlier,
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.280]   but this is the most common eating disorder,
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.000]   affects anywhere between three and 5% of the population.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.400]   - Wow.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.200]   - And is probably under-diagnosed in obesity, by the way.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.920]   And if obesity affects 35% of our population,
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.160]   most likely binge eating disorder
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.880]   affects more than three to 5%,
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.560]   but that's the current literature estimate
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.740]   on the prevalence.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:37.120]   So how do we develop binge eating disorder
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.440]   and is it related to this anxiety question?
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.280]   I think that there is a predisposition,
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.340]   that's the first hit.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:48.080]   I actually think all humans have this predisposition,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.000]   just some have it more than others.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.580]   I don't think that we've evolved to live in a society
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:55.420]   where foods are so readily available
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.360]   and enormously delicious and have so much sugar
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.300]   and fat in them.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.180]   Not that there's any particular problem
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.080]   with either of these macronutrients,
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.000]   it's just the excess of it and how they're refined
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.360]   that I think is the problem.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:11.480]   There's high fructose corn syrup
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.840]   in almost everything we eat, it's in bread.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.480]   I don't even know why it's in bread sometimes.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.040]   It's just kind of crazy.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.280]   So I don't think we're evolved to live in a society
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.880]   that has food that's so readily available like that,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.440]   and cheap, by the way.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.160]   In fact, the cheaper the foods are,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.480]   sort of the more refined and palatable
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.400]   and I would argue, dangerous to eat.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.040]   I think they change our reward circuits for the worse
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.920]   and put us at risk for wanting more.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.440]   I tend to get a headache when I eat food like that
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.800]   and perhaps that's an evolutionary advantage
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.400]   because I don't want to eat those foods
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.200]   'cause they actually do make me sick.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:54.000]   So in a lot of ways, I kind of wish that headache
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.040]   on everybody because perhaps we wouldn't have
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.200]   all these problems or some of them would go away.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.800]   So I think that's the first issue
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.760]   is a predisposition to, or a vulnerability
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   to these types of foods, which we undoubtedly all have
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.080]   to a certain extent, but some more than others.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.200]   And then, so that's the first hit,
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.280]   is this predisposition in the context
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.480]   of this sort of food-focused society.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   And then the second hit is probably a stressful event
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:31.520]   or a stressful life and probably a recurring stressful event.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.180]   I'm not sure this is published.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.080]   I've never sat down with like a eating disorder expert
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.480]   and had this question about how this develops
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.740]   and I'm not sure it's actually well known.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:45.140]   But in a lot of ways, I think that that answer,
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.400]   anybody would agree with, that we need sort of
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.960]   a predisposition in the exposure,
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.920]   the environmental exposure and the genetic predisposition,
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.200]   but also a stressor and that stressor is probably one
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.480]   that's recurring and it's obvious in our society,
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.120]   these stressors are everywhere and how we can manage them
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.400]   is often poor and I think we can all relate with that.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.140]   And then there's something else in the background
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.780]   that I think is really important to mention
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.680]   is that patients with these kinds of problems
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.680]   are embarrassed because our society doesn't think fondly
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.520]   of these kinds of patients.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.380]   Binging disorder patients, they do tend to be overweight.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.720]   That's obviously a stigma.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.660]   Obesity is another stigma.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.320]   Then there's the opposite, in a way it's an opposite
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.140]   by the way, from a phenotype standpoint, that's anorexia.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.440]   I mean, that's another stigma and you know, gosh,
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.760]   not to make this about one sex over another,
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.160]   but when girls are told they're pretty
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.520]   because they're thin, it just reinforces this problem
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.000]   and of course you want to compliment people
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.800]   and make them feel good about themselves,
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.440]   but the problem is that in this vulnerable society,
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.080]   that that can lead to problems because people start thinking,
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.680]   oh, I should be thin or thinner.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:07.040]   So I think that it's a little bit of a societal understanding
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.520]   that our brains are very vulnerable
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.880]   and I think that will really help changing society, it's hard
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.640]   and most of society is not, you know, ill meaning.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.780]   It's all done by accident,
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.400]   but that is the society that we live in.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.600]   So if we can try to improve that stigma
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.160]   and be kinder to people in that way,
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.640]   I think a lot of these problems would get better.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.440]   People that are obese that feel embarrassed
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.800]   by their obesity, it doesn't help.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.320]   It only makes it worse because they give up.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.300]   Same thing might be true for anorexics.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.240]   So I really think it's important
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.720]   to consider all of these things
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.240]   and that's why it's so complicated
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.880]   and it would be so hard to do a well-controlled study
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.800]   to understand it better because there's so many
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.240]   of these variables to control for
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   that you really can't control for.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.120]   You might be able to control for them
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.720]   in a mouse's home cage,
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.000]   but not in the society that we live in.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   So that's kind of my brief sort of summary
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.520]   of how I would answer your first question.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.140]   Then I think, you know, your second question,
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.440]   I sort of take that as, well,
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.480]   how do you study such a complicated problem
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.640]   in the operating room and in the clinic?
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.760]   Because I mentioned the operating room
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.420]   because that's sort of the first step here.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.060]   First, we have, just to clarify,
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:27.760]   we have a NIH-funded trial approved by the FDA
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.920]   for research to do this first in human study.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.580]   We've treated two patients.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.340]   We have four more to come at Penn.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.880]   And in this study, it's something I've been working
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.440]   towards my entire career.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.640]   What we don't know is where in the nucleus
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.640]   accumbens will we identify cells or regions
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.200]   that seem to be involved
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.400]   in this sort of reward-seeking behavior.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.280]   I would call it appetitive.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.280]   It's kind of like appetite,
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.520]   but the word appetitive is, I think, a good word to use.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.680]   What part of the nucleus accumbens is appetitive?
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.960]   Is the whole thing appetitive?
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.800]   Probably not.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.620]   It's huge.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.580]   In my world, it's huge.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.600]   As a neurosurgeon, you know,
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.840]   I target parts of the brain
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.960]   that are three or four millimeters in size.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.360]   The nucleus accumbens is almost a centimeter in size.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.300]   - Wow, I didn't realize it was that large.
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.140]   - Yeah.
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.380]   - This sort of reminds me of discussions
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.220]   around the amygdala.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.800]   Everyone thinks amygdala fear,
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.260]   but amygdala has got a lot of different sub-regions
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.880]   and stimulation of certain areas of the amygdala
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.840]   makes people feel great.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.680]   - That's right.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.840]   - And stimulation of other areas
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.420]   makes them feel terribly afraid.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.260]   - Exactly.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.320]   And that shouldn't surprise us
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.580]   because when we treat patients with Parkinson's disease,
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.420]   for tremor, if we're in one part
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.500]   of the subthalamic nucleus, we'll help their tremor.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.580]   If we're in another part of the subthalamic nucleus,
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.960]   the neurologist is looking at me like,
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.460]   why isn't this working?
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.580]   And that shouldn't surprise us.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.820]   We already know that, you know,
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.300]   two or three millimeters deviation
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.580]   or two or three millimeters away from where we wanna be
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.220]   and you might not have the result you want.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.420]   And that's probably also true
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.120]   for these more limbic structures
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.060]   like the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.580]   So, you know, regarding the nucleus accumbens,
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:13.300]   we traverse some of the nucleus accumbens, not all of it,
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.460]   in order to place the electrode that we want to use
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:21.040]   to detect when cravings are happening, for example,
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.540]   and to try to block the cravings
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.100]   from leading to the behavior related to the reward seeking,
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.000]   which is the overeating in this case.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.180]   So what we decided to do in the operating room
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:38.400]   was to actually try to leverage a tool
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.460]   that we use all the time
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.420]   when we take care of patients with Parkinson's.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.260]   So with Parkinson's, a lot of these patients,
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.080]   not all, have tremor.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.080]   And so when we place an electrode
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.880]   into this motor structure
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.600]   to try to improve their movement disorder,
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.300]   we often can hear tremor cells
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:58.460]   and they sound, we convert their electrical signal
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.780]   to an audible signal so we can actually hear it.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.000]   And it sounds kind of like the tremor looks,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.540]   like the frequency of the signal
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.500]   is the same as the hand shaking.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.620]   - So like zzz, zzz, zzz. - Exactly.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.620]   - And so the patient with Parkinson's is trembling,
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.920]   they're awake, and you're poking around
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.580]   in a dedicated, careful way, of course.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.540]   - One poke at a time. - One poke at a time
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.780]   with a very fine wire, a set of wires,
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.740]   listening to the electrical activity
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:29.020]   until you encounter some cells
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.860]   that are sending out electrical activity
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.720]   at a similar frequency. - Exactly.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.220]   - And then you can stimulate them or quiet them
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.580]   and see if the tremor goes away.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.060]   So we are very confident that when we stimulate that area
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.700]   of, in this case, the subthalamic nucleus,
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.820]   we will make that tremor,
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.860]   we will disrupt that tremor circuit
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.540]   and that tremor will dissolve, and it does.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:54.140]   That's why Parkinson's is so beautiful and inspiring
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.940]   and from a surgical-- - And tractable.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.740]   - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah, but what is the--
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.720]   - It makes us feel we understand the brain,
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.060]   at least in that limited way.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.980]   - So what is the analog to tremor
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.260]   in terms of appetite and desire to binge?
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.340]   - Craving.
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:11.900]   So craving is a term that,
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.500]   there's probably other terms we could use, by the way,
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.500]   but that's the term we've chosen to use
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.820]   for a number of reasons.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:19.020]   One, because people relate with that term.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:22.480]   People that have binge eating disorder or obesity,
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.900]   if you ask them if they crave, the answer will often be yes.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.460]   If you ask them if they lose control or binge,
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.820]   they might not know what you mean
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.700]   or they might not actually feel out of control,
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.660]   even when they are.
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.340]   But the word craving is relatable,
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.760]   and so we set out to see if we could identify craving cells.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.540]   In a patient with OCD, which is related,
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.140]   in fact, we target a very similar part of the brain,
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:54.620]   we tried to identify cells related to obsessions,
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.380]   and we believe we did do that.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.620]   It was a single case study where we tried to optimize
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.260]   where our electrode was placed.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.600]   So we had some proof of concept
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.260]   that we would be able to elicit
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.860]   a sort of disease-specific symptom in the operating room,
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:11.360]   assuming the patient could tolerate being awake.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.540]   Not everybody needs to be awake for this procedure,
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.400]   but at least for these first in human trials
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.600]   where we're trying to establish
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.180]   where in the brain we need to be,
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.680]   I think this type of approach is really critical.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:27.460]   And by the way, none of this has been published,
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.620]   but I think it's so important for people to know this,
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.600]   so I am willing to share some aspects
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.900]   of what we're trying to do.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.860]   But that's really the first goal of this trial
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:43.060]   is to identify where in the nucleus accumbens
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.700]   we can detect these craving cells.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.140]   So we have to provoke food craving in the operating room.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.100]   That's the first thing.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.500]   - How do you do that?
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.860]   - Ah, well, there are some somewhat validated ways
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.420]   to do that.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.040]   So for example, we asked patients to provide pictures
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.300]   of food that they rate very highly
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.620]   as something that they would typically crave.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.660]   And depending on the patient,
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.260]   it might be something that's very salty.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.100]   It could be very sweet, like a donut.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.120]   - Donuts are good.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:11.960]   - I love donuts.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.200]   - Right, donuts are great.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.460]   - You should try the Cronut when you're here
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.300]   in New York City.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.920]   - I just might, I try not to eat that sort of thing.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.860]   For all the reasons they change your brain,
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.340]   worth one bite. - It's worth one bite.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.940]   Just try to stop yourself after that one bite.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.260]   - So if I were one of these patients,
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:29.260]   given the fact that the binges come on pretty seldom
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.940]   once a day, do you, I imagine you have them come
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:35.220]   to the operating room fasted or semi-fasted?
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.060]   - They're fasted, yep.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.340]   - Okay, they're fasted, which probably,
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.660]   there are probably surgical reasons for wanting that too.
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:40.900]   - Yes, they kind of have to be.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:44.180]   - Right, and then you've done the craniotomy,
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.740]   you've removed a patch of skull, lowered the wire
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:50.500]   into the nucleus accumbens, and then they are viewing
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.820]   pictures of food that they crave and thinking about it.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.980]   Do they have olfactory cues, smells of Cronuts and donuts?
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:57.460]   - Yeah, I would love to do the olfactory cues.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:00.160]   We haven't implemented that, but that is a great,
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.020]   thank you, and I'll give you full credit when we do.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.140]   - Sure, I didn't review the grant, but it sounds,
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.300]   I'm so glad this work is funded because I mean,
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.220]   this is what I, I'll make, this time it's not a joke.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:13.180]   When I referred to you all, you neurosurgeons
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:16.220]   as the astronauts of the brain, you know,
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:21.220]   this is out on the extreme edge of what we don't know
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.340]   about how the brain functions.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.220]   And this is so far and away different
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.240]   than giving a mouse access to a high fat food.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.420]   Not that that, I'm not being disparaging of the mouse work,
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:34.660]   but so the person says, well, I'm the patient in this case,
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.380]   so I might say, you know, I'm hungry,
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.620]   a donut sounds really good right now,
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:41.700]   but craving to me is like, I, you know,
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:46.340]   I'll cross the street, cross town, be late for my meeting,
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:50.740]   eat three of these, maybe even hide that from somebody
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.860]   that cares about me, that doesn't want me doing this,
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.580]   this kind of thing, hide it from myself.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.620]   - Yes.
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.260]   - These kinds of behaviors I'm projecting,
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:01.220]   I'm fortunate that I have cravings for things in life,
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.980]   but donuts are not among the more extreme of them.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.380]   So, so this is all happening in real time
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:09.220]   and you're listening to the cells the same way
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.700]   you would listen to it and search for tremor cells.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.080]   - Exactly, same exact tools.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.460]   - And you're doing that by recording
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.100]   from a small population of cells in the area?
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.340]   - Yeah, in fact, we do get multi-unit activity,
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.540]   which is multiple cells, but we really try to find one.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.860]   A single unit to listen to.
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:27.700]   - One neuron.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.460]   - Yeah, because it's just much easier to understand
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.300]   what that one neuron is doing
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.960]   versus trying to listen to multiple.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.220]   And we also measure local field potential recordings,
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.680]   but those are analyzed,
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.620]   which is more of a population response, thousands of cells.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.180]   - Kind of a chorus of cells.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.940]   - Exactly, that we measure offline.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:52.160]   The device that we use to sort of treat these patients
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.060]   or intervene that we're studying,
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:57.040]   it can't do single unit recordings.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.300]   It's only doing these more population responses.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.900]   So, we correlate what we see in the operating room
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.580]   at the single unit level to the population response,
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.980]   but we do that all offline.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.840]   I can explain that in a moment.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.300]   But yeah, so we try to identify these craving cells
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.260]   and because this is a feasibility study
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:22.340]   and we can't be in the operating room searching
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.900]   for hours and hours and hours,
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.520]   we do have some sort of,
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.780]   we have guidelines that we've set for ourselves,
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:31.540]   that we've developed with the NIH or the FDA
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.580]   to make sure that what we're doing
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.900]   is feasible and safe as well.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.100]   So, we will spend a limited time
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.340]   trying to identify these craving cells.
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:44.200]   But another sort of strategy
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.840]   that we think is really important
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.940]   is the effect of the stimulation.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.220]   So, a lot of patients,
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.860]   and this gets to sort of your question earlier
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.040]   about what kind of, what comes first.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:58.220]   A lot of people when they binge
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:03.080]   or they lose control over food or seek drugs,
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.520]   that moment of vulnerability is preceded
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   by what we call a moment of sort of pre-meal negative effect
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.100]   which basically means right before they binge,
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.560]   they're feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.560]   and they compensate for that momentary symptom
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.340]   by binging or losing control over food.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.940]   Not everybody meets criteria for a binge,
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.980]   so I try to specify that we are looking
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.540]   at loss of control eating specifically
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.200]   just because the criterion of a binge
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.820]   is not as critical for us.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:44.240]   So, what we wanna be able to do is trigger stimulation
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.600]   when this craving is detected by the device.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.820]   But we trigger it only when the craving is there
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.760]   and we believe that if we can sort of
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.480]   temporarily elevate their mood ever so briefly,
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.680]   again, this is about five to 10 seconds of stimulation only,
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.020]   that perhaps that elevation in mood
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:09.020]   could actually sort of disrupt the craving to binge cycle.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:12.860]   Maybe that's a habit, maybe it's not,
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.100]   but if you crave and then you binge,
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.780]   if we can interrupt that with this moment
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.380]   of feeling good, that might be a really good therapy
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.500]   for a patient.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.880]   And in fact, when we do deep brain stimulation
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.060]   for obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:32.680]   we can fairly reliably induce a positive effect.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.100]   The problem is that it's not sustained
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.100]   and the reason it's likely not sustained
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.760]   is because with obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.000]   we treat that condition with continuous stimulation
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.160]   and it's not surprising that over time,
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.740]   the effect kind of goes away.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.700]   So when they're in the clinic and we turn the device on,
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.260]   our patients feel great
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.300]   and we feel like we've solved the problem,
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.500]   but they call us the next day
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.620]   and they're like, you know, my depression came back
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.120]   or my OCD hasn't gotten better
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.180]   and my mood's back to where it was.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.940]   Can you get it back to where it was yesterday?
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.140]   'Cause that felt great.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.020]   - The brain loves homeostatic regulation.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:07.860]   - It does.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.020]   - And it does not like to shift patterns.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.020]   - Regression to the norm.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.020]   - Right.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:15.180]   - And I think there's sort of a tolerance effect there
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:19.620]   that is limiting the effect of continuous stimulation
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:22.420]   and actually in a mouse, if you do continuous stimulation,
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:27.300]   the sort of blockade of binge eating goes away.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.940]   So actually in a mouse, we've actually demonstrated,
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.460]   we published this not too long ago in PNAS,
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:37.300]   that if you deliver stimulation intermittently
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.200]   and only when sort of a craving signal is detected,
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:44.920]   so to speak, that effect will be the most robust
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.520]   and durable.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.380]   But if you deliver it continuously,
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.100]   actually the benefit goes away over time.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.380]   So I've always encouraged my colleagues
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.440]   to consider more of an episodic stimulation approach
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.280]   rather than continuous deep brain stimulation.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.380]   But of course that's for these more episodic conditions,
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.900]   whereas these more quote unquote state disorders,
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.300]   as I oversimplified earlier,
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.060]   they might need more of a continuous therapy.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.600]   So that's definitely subject for a lot of research
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.440]   in the future.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.940]   So in any case, the goal in the operating room
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:15.940]   was to identify a craving cell,
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:20.020]   deliver stimulation safely,
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.240]   but also to capture a moment of elevated mood.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.060]   We were able to do that as we are in our OCD patients
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.340]   as well.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:31.540]   And also to get an intraoperative CAT scan.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.760]   We have devices now in the operating room
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.900]   that allow us to get imaging in real time.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:39.500]   They're fabulous tools that we didn't have 10 years ago.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.040]   So we can confirm accuracy.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.100]   - So you can see where the electrode is precisely.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.500]   - Exactly, with 0.5 millimeters of error.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:52.220]   So super precise or as precise as we think we need to be.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:55.980]   And we use connectomics.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:16:00.980]   So there's a tool in brain imaging called tractography,
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.020]   where we can actually measure circuit connections.
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.460]   It's an indirect assay, but we believe it's powerful.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.340]   It has its assumptions,
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:13.340]   but like anything in science.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:16.980]   But we can actually map out
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.980]   where the nucleus accumbens connects
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.520]   to the prefrontal cortex,
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:25.060]   sort of the cortical control and inhibitory control pathway
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.700]   and where that pathway intersects
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:27.940]   with the nucleus accumbens.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.620]   And we can target that area structurally.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.360]   So those three goals of the surgery,
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.100]   we aim to set out to accomplish.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.900]   And we believed if we achieved two of those three,
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.940]   that we would have a successful result in our early trial.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.780]   - Amazing.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:49.060]   Given that at least to me, the non-clinician,
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:54.060]   that anorexia is the mirror image of binge eating disorder.
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:57.520]   And at least from what I learned,
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.340]   one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions,
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.980]   but also quite common.
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:03.820]   - Yes.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:07.540]   - Is it possible that nucleus accumbens,
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:12.540]   this so-called reward circuit is also involved in anorexia,
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.100]   but somehow it is the resistance to eating,
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.300]   the craving of the fasted state or something like that
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.940]   that's being reinforced.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.460]   And I asked this for two reasons.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:25.640]   One, because I'm genuinely curious about anorexia.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.780]   I've observed anorexia in a number of people I know,
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:32.780]   and it's a striking thing to see somebody just resist food,
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:36.920]   despite all better knowledge of the fact
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.580]   that they're getting quite ill, maybe even at risk of death.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.580]   But the other reason is that if in fact nucleus accumbens
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:50.620]   is the site which can harbor cells to promote craving
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:55.940]   and craving of fasted states, so to speak,
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:58.260]   then that I think might tell us something fundamental
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.140]   about how the brain works,
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.500]   which is that structures don't control functions per se,
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.980]   structures control dynamics of interactions.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:09.940]   Sort of like a orchestra conductor
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.140]   has a certain number of operations that they perform,
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.840]   but really their main function is to coordinate the actions
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.100]   of a lot of things,
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.420]   not to make sure that the violins always play
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:21.500]   in a certain way alongside the oboes.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.200]   You can tell I'm not a musician here.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.420]   [laughing]
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.040]   - I actually have an appreciation for the oboes.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.020]   Those usually get left out.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:27.860]   - What's that, the oboes?
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.820]   - Yeah, they usually get ignored.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.040]   - My partner plays the oboes.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:31.880]   - Oh, wow.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.700]   - Yeah, so.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.740]   - I think it's a great analogy, by the way.
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.780]   I make this statement, it's a little controversial,
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.940]   but I actually think people would understand
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:43.980]   where I'm coming from across all of these
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:46.820]   sort of subspecialties of medicine.
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.420]   But I actually think, especially with obesity,
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.340]   remember it's a phenotype that's reflective often,
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.660]   but not always of a behavior.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.660]   But if you consider patients that have obesity
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.620]   and they exhibit some sort of compulsion towards food,
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:03.300]   so they overeat despite the risk of it,
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:06.020]   I think those kinds of patients are more similar
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:08.340]   to anorexics than they are different.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:11.620]   Anorexia and obesity are both phenotypes that are,
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:15.180]   at least in this specific case of obesity and anorexia,
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:18.300]   a result of a compulsion to either over or under eat
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.380]   despite the risk.
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.940]   These types of compulsions are driven by societal pressures,
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:28.180]   brain vulnerabilities that are probably more similar
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.580]   than they are different.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.740]   They just happen to manifest differently.
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.860]   Why they manifest differently is probably related
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.300]   to each patient's predisposition or perhaps preference.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.100]   That's hard to know.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.220]   Like you, I have a personal connection
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:45.580]   to these eating disorders, anorexia included,
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.940]   and yeah, I think it's very scary.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:55.900]   And it's a condition that often instills fear
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:59.700]   in psychiatrists because I think,
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.740]   not everybody, by the way,
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.260]   I mean, I have some phenomenal psychiatrists
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:07.380]   that I work with both at Stanford and at Penn.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.020]   They're also involved in my obesity study
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.180]   that take care of these patients.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.140]   I mean, these are heroes,
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.380]   but there's a lot of psychiatrists that are not
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:15.660]   in this domain that find anorexia scary
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:16.500]   for the reason you said.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.940]   It has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.940]   That includes depression
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.020]   because not only can these patients die of suicide,
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.900]   but they die of metabolic complications
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.060]   of being underweight.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.820]   So it is a scary condition.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.820]   I relate with that.
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:37.660]   I am trying over time to bridge what I'm doing
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.300]   in obesity and binging disorder to anorexia
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.140]   for two reasons.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.260]   One, because I think these problems are more similar
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.340]   than they are different, and two, because of the need.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.620]   And I think we're well positioned
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:53.620]   to sort of tackle anorexia using similar approaches,
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.840]   not identical, but similar approaches.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.700]   The nucleus accumbens has been studied
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.460]   in patients with anorexia in China.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.980]   Actually, my postdoc, my first postdoc,
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.100]   who I had the honor to train when I was at Stanford
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:10.160]   as a neurosurgeon in China when, before he came to me,
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.300]   actually was involved in a trial of anorexia
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.460]   that had some benefits.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:18.020]   And there's studies in Europe
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:23.500]   and elsewhere that have examined preliminarily
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.920]   the effects of deep brain stimulation
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.540]   targeting the nucleus accumbens.
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.900]   Four anorexia colleagues of mine in Canada,
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:34.640]   Andres Lizados, a wonderful neurosurgeon scientist,
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.420]   has been studying the effects of going after area 25,
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.560]   which is directly connected to the nucleus accumbens by,
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:45.000]   it's a monosynaptic connection, so in a lot of ways,
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.260]   perhaps delivering stimulation there could be very similar
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.100]   to delivering stimulation to the nucleus accumbens.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:53.260]   It's all part of one critical inhibitory control circuit.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:55.280]   He's seen benefits as well.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.520]   So I definitely think there's some evidence
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.920]   that this is an area that we need to be studying.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.520]   I think our more episodic approach
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.560]   with responsive stimulation going after sort of a signal
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.020]   in the nucleus accumbens that seems to be related
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:13.300]   to the compulsion to withhold from eating,
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.100]   I think is what we will be trying to accomplish
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:16.940]   in our study.
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.900]   It's right now just being conceived, though.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.340]   These studies, they move so slowly
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.140]   because you have to get a grant.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.500]   That grant gets reviewed by the NIH six months
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.000]   after you submit it, often gets rejected
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.220]   because it's too innovative and too high risk,
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:36.220]   so then you have to edit it and decrease the risk.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:39.980]   So it takes, my obesity study took two years to get funded.
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.780]   And I worry about that timeframe
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.500]   because that's a lot of time for patients
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.860]   with anorexia to suffer that I might be able to help,
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.460]   at least in a small sample of patients.
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:50.980]   So, but that is the nature of how these things go.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:52.320]   You also have to get FDA approval
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.540]   to do these kinds of things.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.940]   We try to do all of this in parallel.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.740]   It's an enormous undertaking.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.660]   And in a lot of ways, we're starting from scratch,
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.860]   but in some ways, we have some preliminary data
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:01.900]   to go after this.
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.700]   So my hope is in about a year,
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.100]   we'll have a similar trial for anorexia at Penn,
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.540]   so more to come on that.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.620]   And we're not the only lab that's trying to go after it
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.300]   because of the clear need, so.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.540]   - What is the status of non-invasive brain stimulation,
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.420]   ablation, and blocking activity in the brain?
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.340]   - I get a lot of questions
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.620]   about transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.460]   I've actually had that done as a research subject.
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.940]   And I was at Berkeley, Rich Ivory's lab,
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.180]   put a coil on my head.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:33.100]   I was tapping my finger in concert to a drum beat.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.860]   And then all of a sudden, because of the stimulation,
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:40.020]   it was impossible for me to keep time with the drum beat.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.220]   It's a pretty wild experience to not have motor control
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:47.860]   and then to have motor control returned
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.740]   at the flip of a switch when someone else is controlling
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.780]   the switch makes it especially eerie.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.700]   So my understanding is that transcranial magnetic stimulation
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.940]   is being used to treat depression
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.380]   and a number of other brain syndromes non-invasively,
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.960]   so no drilling through the skull.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.940]   Surgeons don't like that.
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:08.100]   Surgeons love to cut and drill with purpose, but they do.
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.340]   - With purpose, yes.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:13.540]   - But my understanding is that the spatial precision
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.740]   isn't that great.
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:19.660]   Ultrasound is something I hear a lot about these days.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.420]   And my understanding is that ultrasound can allow
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:25.460]   researchers and clinicians to stimulate specific brain areas,
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.460]   perhaps with more precision.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.420]   Maybe you could just give us a brief coverage
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.040]   of what those are being used for.
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.040]   What are your thoughts on these forms of non-invasive,
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.920]   meaning no flipping open of a piece of the skull
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.380]   type brain stimulation and blockade of brain activity?
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.500]   - Sure, yeah, I wanted to clarify also.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.820]   These surgeries generally don't, by the way,
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:51.980]   require a full craniotomy.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.420]   It's usually just a small opening about the size of a dime
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.300]   in the bone, so just to clarify.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.380]   - But painless too, right?
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.420]   - Usually without pain.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.260]   - Yeah, a little bit of scalp numbing.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.660]   - We give a scalp block and the patients are getting
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.580]   IV sedations, so they in general don't feel anything.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.180]   And if they do, they tell me and we give them
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.500]   more local anesthetic, but they're usually asleep
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.660]   during that part.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:14.040]   So it's minimally invasive, but in a lot of ways,
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.280]   there's no such thing as a minimally invasive procedure
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.300]   in the brain, you know?
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:18.700]   It's kind of a misnomer. - I'm so glad
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.680]   to hear you say that.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.780]   - Oh no, I am not one of those neurosurgeons
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.040]   that you've probably encountered,
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.120]   and we have mutual friends that,
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:29.260]   and these mutual friends are some of my favorite people
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.820]   in neurosurgery, and they probably actually think
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:34.040]   more like me than not, but there are neurosurgeons
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:34.880]   that you're absolutely right.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.140]   And this is true for all surgeries.
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:39.180]   They really, in a lot of ways, they think what they do
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:42.220]   is sort of the ground truth, or closer to the ground truth.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:47.020]   And I get that, you know, probing with purpose.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.960]   I actually really like that.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.540]   I'm gonna use that if you don't mind.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.160]   - It's just describing what you do, so the, yeah.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.580]   - But I actually have, I've always said this.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:58.480]   I've said it publicly.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.720]   I've said it to my boss.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.200]   I've said this to my team.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.460]   We need to embrace noninvasive approaches.
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:10.020]   Some of them are a little fluffy, fluffy in that
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.300]   we don't understand how they work.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.940]   We don't necessarily understand how deep brain stimulation
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.180]   works, by the way, so.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:18.760]   But because we don't know exactly how they work,
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.620]   they're not as precise as we would like them to be,
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.400]   so we have work to do there, and I actually think
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.600]   that work is doable, and actually underway.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.980]   You know, at Stanford, we have great collaborators
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:31.820]   that I think are doing this, people like Nolan Williams,
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:34.400]   and Connor Liston at Cornell, and others.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.800]   So we, I think that TMS, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation,
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.240]   it is FDA approved for depression, by the way.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.460]   It's also FDA approved for OCD and for nicotine addiction.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:49.040]   - Where do they put the coil for those three,
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:49.880]   or more or less?
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.460]   - Yeah, so they put it over, well, it's always on the scalp
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:55.760]   and over the frontal lobe, and there's different parts
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.240]   of the frontal lobe that have been demonstrated
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.760]   to be a little better or a little bit worse,
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.800]   but what the FDA has approved for depression,
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.960]   I believe is similar to what's been approved for OCD,
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.380]   but for addiction, I believe it is a different target,
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.080]   but we'd have to ask our TMS experts on that.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.440]   - Can they direct the trans-cranial magnetic stimulation
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.520]   deep below the cortex?
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.560]   - They try, and we're actually studying this
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.240]   in OCD patients now.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.440]   As a part of our invasive trial,
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.360]   we are trying to pull patients from a TMS trial
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.920]   that's in parallel to what we're doing,
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.480]   all funded by the Foundation for OCD Research,
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.240]   where we believe we can use TMS to define a circuit
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.240]   that, if modulated, improves OCD, albeit temporarily,
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.460]   and in those patients, if it's temporary,
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.640]   they would be appropriate for an invasive study,
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.760]   so something we're actively working on.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.440]   I've always believed that neurosurgeons need to be part
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.920]   of the discussion with these non-invasive approaches.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.720]   We don't need to do them,
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.840]   but I think we can help make them more precise
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.200]   and to probe non-invasively with purpose
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:13.120]   rather than this more kind of, I don't know,
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.960]   a non-invasive blast effect kind of, you know,
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.760]   I just can't imagine how that is gonna be as effective
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.720]   as probing with purpose,
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.400]   but you can do that non-invasively as well,
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.080]   and I think we need to do better in that way.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.160]   I do believe that's possible,
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.040]   and I think people are actively trying to do it.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.400]   Getting deep in the brain with TMS,
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.560]   I think, will always be hard,
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.520]   but you can get there indirectly
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.480]   by using connectivity assays
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.760]   and targeting superficial structures
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.720]   that have high connectivity to deep structures.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.200]   So, for example, perhaps one day,
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:50.080]   there will be a TMS target for anorexia and obesity.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.320]   If we are scratching the surface
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.880]   with invasive approaches to these problems,
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.920]   we're even doing less with the brain stimulation.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.640]   So we have so much work to do there.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:06.640]   Eating disorders and TMS have been so sort of scarcely studied
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:12.360]   or there have been such little research done in that space.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.920]   So it is an area that we need to work on.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.480]   For the obvious reason, for example,
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.000]   in a patient with anorexia, just thinking practically,
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.760]   you know, placing a device in a patient
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.640]   who is significantly underweight
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.360]   might not be the best approach.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.480]   You know, wound erosion and issues like that could come up.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.360]   So developing a non-invasive approach, I think, is critical.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.720]   The problem is where do we target?
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.880]   And so the only way to answer that, I think, reliably
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.680]   is to accept that we have to get into the brain
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.560]   before we're out of the brain.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.760]   And with these kinds of conditions,
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.200]   we're only just starting to get into the brain, you know?
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.360]   So I worry that we're a long way away
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.720]   from a non-invasive approach that really works consistently.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.920]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.080]   I want to make sure we touch on ultrasound 'cause-
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.040]   - Yes, sure, no, I love that.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.120]   - But historically, it seemed that there was
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.800]   a bit more permission for people to probe around
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.640]   in the human brain.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.200]   I sometimes refer the podcast to some of these papers
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.320]   that were done allowing patients
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.080]   to self-stimulate in the brain.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.480]   These are work done in the '60s
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.160]   and now his name escapes me, Robert.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.880]   Anyway, there's a couple of papers published in Science
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.520]   allowing patients to stimulate
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:25.520]   a couple different brain areas,
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.920]   asking which ones they preferred.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.920]   And I was always shocked and slightly intrigued
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.840]   by the fact that the brain area
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.480]   that all three of these patients,
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.880]   who I don't think had any syndromes,
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.160]   I think they volunteered for these experiments.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.560]   I don't think you could do this anymore.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:43.080]   - Yes, regulatory was not the same as it is now.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.400]   - Things have changed, fortunately.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.160]   But they, all three of them seem to like
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.880]   some midline thalamic structure,
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.700]   which for those listening,
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:55.080]   is just an area kind of in the dead center of the brain,
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.400]   more or less,
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.680]   that evoked a sense of kind of frustration and anger,
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.700]   which surprised me because I would have thought,
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.760]   oh, it's Robert Heath, these experiments,
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.920]   rather than patients preferring to stimulate areas
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.440]   that evoke laughter or joy
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.680]   or a feeling of drunkenness or delight.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.520]   It also explains a lot of what I observe in social media,
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.880]   the sort of kind of people repeatedly engaging in battles
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.080]   that are kind of trivial.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.540]   It seems like frustration and anger
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:23.120]   might have its own reward circuitry.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.240]   Anyway, I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole,
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.000]   but it-
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:27.840]   - It's a deep one.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.660]   - It's a deep one.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:32.260]   And kind of gets to our nature as humans
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:34.820]   and what we find interesting or rewarding.
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:39.820]   But the inability to probe around the brain in a safe way
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:46.640]   without the need for somebody to be very sick would be,
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.080]   I think it would be enormously powerful.
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:50.360]   And at least to my mind, if I were in charge,
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:53.480]   which I'm not, would offer the opportunity
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.800]   to really come to an understanding
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.780]   about how the human brain works without all these issues
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.560]   of how to translate for mouse studies.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.700]   And again, there's huge value to animal studies
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:03.540]   as we both agree,
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:06.980]   but so many of the things that we want to know
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.780]   about the human brain involve asking the person,
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:12.180]   hey, what do you feel when that set of neurons
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.820]   is stimulated and what don't you feel?
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.920]   And a mouse, we can ask and ask,
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.760]   but they're not going to tell us them.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.740]   They do tell us, they're not going to tell us in English.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:23.040]   So how do we overcome this challenge?
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.380]   But first ultrasound, or if you prefer after ultrasound,
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.780]   is ultrasound going to be really useful
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:31.480]   toward solving these clinical issues and these basic issues?
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.400]   - Yeah, so I think, let's start with ultrasound
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.000]   and then we'll come back to it.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.020]   So ultrasound right now,
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:44.020]   transcranial magnetic resonance guided focus ultrasound.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:49.580]   So this is an FDA approved method.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:55.060]   To deliver an ablation to the brain non-invasively.
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.940]   There are researchers, myself included,
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:01.100]   that are trying to use transcranial magnetic guided,
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.140]   magnetic resonance guided focus ultrasound
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:05.120]   or MRI guided focus ultrasound.
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:08.980]   To use it in a modulatory way, not just as an ablation,
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.540]   but to drive neuronal activity or inhibit it perhaps.
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:14.760]   We're still learning how to do that.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.380]   There are trials that are trying to understand
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.540]   if you can use ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:23.940]   so you can deliver a medication to that specific area,
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.680]   perhaps for a brain tumor or something like that.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.780]   So it's a very exciting field.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:32.020]   And it is FDA approved for tremor right now.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.460]   And so I actually do it routinely
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:37.880]   for patients with tremor with Parkinson's
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.380]   or a central tremor.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.580]   And so I love doing it.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:44.420]   It's often just kind of a miracle
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:45.580]   because there's no incision.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.160]   I don't have to place an electrode into the brain
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.120]   to achieve a similar result.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.540]   - How early into the pathology of Parkinson's
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.260]   can someone think about approaching this?
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:57.560]   So for instance, if somebody has a parent or a sibling
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.780]   and they're developing some resting tremor,
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:01.400]   obviously they should talk to a neurologist,
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.060]   but a neurosurgeon, but this non-invasive approach
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:06.800]   could be incredible for them,
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.720]   as opposed to just only taking drugs
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.180]   to increase dopamine levels.
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:13.900]   - Yeah, so depending on the reason you have tremor
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.960]   would dictate the kind of medication you would use.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.420]   It could be Parkinson's, but if it's not,
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.420]   it might be a central tremor.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:20.220]   By the way, central tremor is 10 times
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.140]   as common as Parkinson's.
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:24.780]   Central tremor is the most common neurologic condition
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:27.060]   in patients over the age of 70.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:29.520]   We often aren't aware of that.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.620]   People with a central tremor feel
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:31.860]   they have their forgotten disease
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.940]   because there's no Michael J. Fox for a central tremor.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.260]   I sent a letter to Bill-
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.700]   - Sorry, is it essential tremor or essential tremor?
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.900]   - Yeah, E-S-S-E-N-T-I-A-L.
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:46.160]   I actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.700]   I've observed tremor in him,
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.560]   and I think he's actually disclosed that he has it,
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.740]   and I hoped he'd become a champion
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.160]   for patients with a central tremor.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.580]   Sandra Day O'Connor does as well.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:57.740]   She's also public about it,
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:00.160]   but I was not able to get them eager
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.880]   to become the champion for this condition,
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.440]   but like Michael J. Fox,
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.620]   these patients need a champion like that,
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:10.080]   but unfortunately, it's a bit of a forgotten disease.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.420]   Nevertheless, because of the FDA approval
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.320]   of Focus Ultrasound for tremor,
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.700]   they're starting to get some attention for sure,
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:20.580]   and it's fabulously effective for these patients.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.820]   It treats patients on one side,
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:24.240]   usually their dominant hand or their worse hand,
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.360]   and it really speaks to the fact that, wow,
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.060]   you can deliver noninvasively an ablation to the brain
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:34.580]   in a hypothesized zone that we think is related
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:35.880]   to the problem at hand,
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:38.620]   and at least with tremor, it works really well.
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.340]   Could this be effective for psychiatric disease,
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:44.080]   obesity, eating disorders?
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.860]   Well, perhaps.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.660]   Actually, that would be the ideal.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.620]   The problem is we don't know where to do the ablation.
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:55.300]   There is a trial that we would like to do for OCD
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.980]   where we would deliver an ablation
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:58.260]   to the same area of the brain
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.460]   that we've been delivering ablations to for years
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:02.220]   for patients with OCD, and it helps a bit.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:03.620]   That's called a capsulotomy,
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:07.100]   but really, the outcome is probably gonna be about the same.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.860]   It's a nice method because it's noninvasive,
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:13.260]   but we need to find a new target for these conditions,
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.340]   and because of the common denominator of the urge
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.160]   despite the risk, sort of that compulsion,
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.580]   perhaps it could be the same target.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:25.440]   I don't know, but I would argue we need
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.700]   to do these modulatory experiments either with a device
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:32.480]   or with invasive recordings to better understand
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.360]   where these problems are coming from
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:37.880]   to define where we should do an ultrasound treatment.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.880]   So you're right.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.560]   Historically, without much regulation,
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.160]   we've probed the brain.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:49.000]   The problem, we can't learn a lot
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.760]   from those experiments now, well, in this way at least.
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.800]   We don't know exactly where those electrodes were.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.920]   We didn't have MRI scanning or high-quality CAT scanning
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.200]   to know where those electrodes were with certainty,
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.640]   and we know two or three millimeters matters,
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.040]   and we also didn't have the tools
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.840]   to place electrodes in a precise way back then.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.720]   So unfortunately, we can't learn a lot
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:12.760]   from those experiments right now.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.640]   So we're sort of redesigning them,
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.240]   and there is a way to do it now.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.840]   Patients with epilepsy benefit from this all the time.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.120]   There has been a revolution in America.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.240]   It was in Europe before it was in America
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.860]   where we would do stereoencephalography,
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:29.440]   which is basically like doing an EEG
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.760]   of patients with epilepsy but with invasive electrodes,
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.480]   and we would place tiny little wires,
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.160]   less than a millimeter in diameter,
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.020]   all throughout the brain into parts of the brain
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.280]   that we believe are involved in seizures,
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.380]   and we would admit the patients to the hospital
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.760]   and figure out where the seizures
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.640]   were starting and propagating,
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:48.280]   and then we could stimulate these electrodes
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.500]   to see if there was a symptom that was important,
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.760]   and try to identify a region
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.920]   that we thought we could either remove surgically,
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.520]   ablate with a laser, or put a stimulator in it perhaps.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.480]   That's commonplace now for epilepsy,
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.340]   and it works extremely well, and it's very safe.
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:08.680]   Of course, it's still a brain procedure,
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:12.540]   but the complication rate is surprisingly low,
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:15.440]   quite honestly, for the amount of electrodes that we place,
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.620]   and it's extremely well tolerated.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:18.920]   Most of these patients leave the hospital,
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:21.160]   and they don't even feel like they've had surgery,
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.280]   so there's actually a lot of interest
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.480]   in using that procedure to study mental health disorders.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.640]   We are trying to do it for patients
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.500]   with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:35.160]   We're awaiting an FDA decision on that,
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.720]   but actually, I credit our colleagues at Baylor
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.380]   and at UCSF for studying this already.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.920]   We have fabulous colleagues at UCSF
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.080]   that have studied depression using this type of approach.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:52.760]   A mutual friend of ours, Eddie Chang,
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.360]   who's a wonderful friend and colleague,
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.240]   somebody I've emulated for many years as well,
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.520]   and the psychiatry team at UCSF
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.760]   have worked together on this, sort of bringing together
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.680]   the epilepsy technique and the psychiatry expertise
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.080]   to study how we could better target electrodes
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.000]   in depression, and I'll tell you,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.520]   if they have a consistent target,
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.240]   perhaps there becomes an ultrasound target,
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.220]   but right now, the approach is a bit more reversible
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:23.360]   'cause you can always shut that electrode off
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:26.360]   or even remove the electrode if perhaps it's not
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.760]   in the optimal location to treat the depression,
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.960]   but actually, after a large volume of cases,
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.640]   perhaps they could pool that data
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.440]   to develop a new ultrasound target for depression.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.600]   I think that would be fabulous,
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.440]   and probably is their long-term goal,
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.520]   not to speak for them, but that would be something
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.560]   that I'm sure is on their radar,
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.120]   and Baylor's trying to do the same thing for depression.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.720]   Their approaches are a little bit different,
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.520]   but a similar tool to try to understand depression,
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.680]   and we're working with all of these types of colleagues,
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:00.720]   some of these are our friends,
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.320]   to try to bring this to OCD as well,
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.200]   and it makes sense to try to do this for addiction
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:08.500]   and obesity and anorexia.
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.000]   You might ask, well, why aren't you doing this
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000]   for obesity right now in our study,
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.960]   and the reason is that we've developed a target
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.440]   for obesity and binge eating disorder developed out of mice
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.760]   that we believe is relevant for the human state
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.360]   because you can model this problem in a mouse
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.060]   a bit better than you can model depression or OCD,
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:34.080]   so we feel like we can rely on the preclinical studies more,
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.280]   whereas with these perhaps more,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.480]   I don't wanna say more complicated,
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.920]   but more human mental health conditions
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.720]   that are hard to model in a mouse,
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.620]   you really have to study it in the human,
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:47.660]   and you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient,
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.000]   a patient that has electrodes
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000]   and try to provoke a depressed state or study epileptics
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.280]   like Dr. Chang has done that have comorbid depression,
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.720]   for example, and that can really validate
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.820]   this approach as well, but in the end,
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.360]   it's getting into the human brain
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.680]   that we need to do in the disease specifically
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:09.600]   that will eventually lead to a non-invasive approach,
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.680]   either a lesion or a modulatory approach.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.200]   Modulatory would be like TMS,
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.740]   or lesion approach would be with ultrasound.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:19.520]   - I couldn't agree more.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.960]   Meanwhile, because there are many, many millions
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.900]   of people suffering from depression, eating disorders,
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:29.760]   Parkinson's and essential tremor, et cetera.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.440]   Well, first of all, I should say,
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.960]   based on everything you've told me thus far,
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.440]   it's amazing to me that any pharmacologic treatments work
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.400]   because of how systemic they are
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:44.480]   and impacting serotonergic neurons over here
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.000]   and dopaminergic neurons over there
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.980]   and not targeting any specific batch of cells.
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:49.000]   It makes perfect sense
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.240]   as to why all the side effects exist,
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.440]   but earlier you said something
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.780]   that really grabbed my attention I want to come back to,
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:59.040]   which is that if people can be made to feel
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:02.320]   or make themselves feel just a little bit better,
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.560]   a little less anxious just prior to a craving episode
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:06.720]   or a binge episode,
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.800]   maybe even if people can become better
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.160]   at detecting their own internal states
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.520]   and when they're kind of veering toward a binge
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.320]   or veering toward using a drug
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:20.760]   or maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.800]   based on what you said earlier,
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.560]   that those kind of pre-behavioral states
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.200]   on the kind of drift on the steering,
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:37.360]   those sound like powerful levels of awareness,
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.960]   at least for now,
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.960]   until we have specific sites in the brain
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.680]   that we can target non-invasive methods
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.880]   that could be deployed to millions and millions of people.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.840]   It seems like that awareness seems like
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:50.760]   maybe among the best tools that people could develop.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.560]   - Yes, I 100% agree with you.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.160]   - So for the person with OCD
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.040]   or who suffers from anorexia or binge eating disorder
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.800]   and to their clinicians,
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.680]   I just want to highlight that you said that.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.560]   I mean, again, I'm not a clinician.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.080]   I always say this, I don't prescribe anything.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.340]   I profess things.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:11.840]   But awareness of one's thinking
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.600]   seems immensely powerful in this context.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:20.520]   And after all, it is the clinical probe that you use
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:23.200]   because let's say the patient were to lie to you
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.360]   about their experience of what happens in their mind
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.440]   when you stimulate,
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:31.760]   basically the whole thing, the whole surgery,
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:34.600]   the whole procedure could go badly wrong.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.120]   So it's up to the patient to be, of course,
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.120]   honest with you and they're incentivized to do that.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.960]   But to be honest with themselves about,
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.800]   ah, you know, I've gone all day without a binge,
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.480]   but you know, the smell of a donut
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.440]   or the thought of a donut
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:51.640]   is starting to have a particular allure,
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.520]   that awareness seems like an incredibly powerful thing
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.080]   to own and to build and cultivate.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:57.960]   - Yes.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.320]   I've always thought that if we could improve awareness,
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.760]   we can improve outcomes.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:04.560]   I think that's probably true for many of these patients.
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:06.720]   The problem I think comes down to the fact
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.600]   that some of these patients are so resistant to treatment.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:14.160]   And the patients that we see as a surgeon, for example,
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:16.480]   are the patients that they've tried
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.160]   cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.480]   certainly have tried medications,
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:21.600]   they've tried behavioral management.
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.880]   They are aware of their problem.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.960]   And they've shown that to us.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.520]   They can tell us when they're craving,
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.800]   but despite the craving and despite being involved
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:32.520]   in this invasive brain surgical trial,
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:36.160]   highly, you know, first in human novel study,
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.520]   which I think will have a positive effect,
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.040]   but it's still experimental.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.800]   They still can't stop themselves.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.800]   So they're sort of as made aware as could possibly be.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.280]   Did I use grammar there correctly?
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.120]   I think so.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.760]   They're as aware as they could possibly be
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.920]   and they still lose control.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.880]   We've had this studied in the lab.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.880]   So we will bring patients to the laboratory
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:02.040]   with this implanted device
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:05.840]   to try to provoke this electrographic electrical signal
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.880]   that can be detected by the actual device
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.960]   that will stimulate them when they're at home.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.760]   But before we actually initiate stimulation,
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.200]   we want to see can this device detect this craving cell
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:20.120]   signal, which is gonna be different
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.080]   than what we saw in the operating room
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.240]   because that's a single cell.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.920]   But these devices, these electrodes are about a millimeter
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.560]   in diameter instead of like a 10th of a millimeter,
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.320]   which is what we use in the operating room.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.160]   So they're only hearing or detecting, I should say,
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:36.560]   thousands of cells responses.
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:41.560]   And we actually have a way to provoke binges.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.440]   It's called a mood provocation.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.040]   It's very well validated.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.640]   It's a little bit like provoking seizures
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.000]   in the epilepsy monitoring unit.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.520]   But here in the sort of psychiatric monitoring unit
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.360]   or the food monitoring unit,
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.400]   we actually have a psychiatrist
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.600]   and eating disorder specialists come and induce a mood
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.880]   that is related to each patient's
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.440]   sort of self-described binge episode.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.840]   - So the psychiatrist comes in and provokes
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:17.440]   a feeling that can evoke the negative behavior.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:18.280]   - That's exactly right.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.200]   So that we can video and synchronize the video
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.480]   to the brain signal recordings.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.840]   The patients all wear an eye tracker
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.240]   so we can see what they're eating at all times
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.400]   and what they're looking at specifically.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.400]   And that allows us to have the best temporal resolution
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.280]   possible to understand what is happening
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.960]   right before the bite.
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.400]   And even under video surveillance through a one-way mirror
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:48.400]   in a laboratory setting when patients are very well aware
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.080]   that they're there to be studied if they're going to binge.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.400]   They still do.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.600]   And we believe they do because they just can't control it
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.360]   as aware as they are of it.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.040]   And it's probably because they're the most severe.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.800]   So I think if we can improve awareness,
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.160]   not just the societal awareness
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.160]   that I was talking about earlier,
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:11.440]   but the patient awareness around their problem,
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.160]   I think that could be a powerful way
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.560]   to help so many of these patients.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:18.160]   And that's sort of the role of cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.840]   The problem with cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.200]   or I should say the limitation of it,
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.560]   I actually don't have any problem with it,
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.200]   I think it's a wonderful treatment,
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.600]   is that if you stop it,
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:30.800]   many of these patients go back to their old behaviors.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.760]   I don't want to say old habits, but it might be a habit,
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.600]   but the old behaviors.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:37.200]   And so that's the problem
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.400]   is that it's not necessarily lasting
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.640]   in the absence of continued cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.480]   Some people can benefit from it long-term, but some can't.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:48.360]   But I think in the less severe patients,
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.160]   improving awareness is key.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.680]   But in these really refractory patients,
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.240]   this is kind of like, this is the disease.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.960]   Despite the awareness, they can't control themselves.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:58.400]   And that's what we're trying to restore
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.840]   is that improved ability to control their behavior.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.880]   - Do you think there's a role for machines
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.360]   and artificial intelligence here?
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.280]   - There are a couple laboratories
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.040]   up at the University of Washington
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:15.040]   that are using particular signature patterns within voice
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:22.240]   to try and help people who are suicidally depressed
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.840]   know when they're headed towards an episode
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.760]   before they even can consciously know.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.280]   So this gets right down to issues of free will
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.400]   and whether or not machines can be smarter than we are.
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.440]   But one could argue that some of the search algorithms
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.080]   on Google and other search engines
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.960]   are actually more aware of our preferences than we are.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.880]   Basically what these are,
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:43.420]   these are devices that are listening to people talk all day.
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:45.480]   They're also paying attention to patterns of breathing
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.880]   and how well people slept, et cetera.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:49.600]   Integrating a huge number of cues
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.200]   and then signaling somebody with a yellow light.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.320]   Like, you're headed into a depressive episode
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.000]   and the person might say, "Oh, I feel fine,"
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.060]   or, "I feel pretty good.
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:48:59.880]   This is kind of baseline state for me."
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.520]   And they'll say, "Uh-uh, this is where you were
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.600]   preceding the last episode that took you down
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.000]   a deep dark trench and it took months to get out of."
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.320]   I wonder whether or not some of these devices
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.160]   could help with the sorts of things
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.400]   that we're talking about today.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.700]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:19.040]   I've always said we have to get in the brain
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.280]   before we get out of it.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.960]   And if we get in the brain and understand
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.720]   what these signals look like,
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:26.520]   we'll know what those non-invasive signals are.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:30.320]   I think it's possible that we are
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:33.960]   scientifically sophisticated enough to
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.960]   use machine learning and sort of this kind of bot technique
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.040]   to anticipate when somebody is going to be highly impulsive.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.560]   Suicide is the most dangerous impulse.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:45.760]   It's something that is
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.860]   immensely a focus of the lab is impulsivity.
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:53.120]   We've talked mostly about compulsion.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.320]   Compulsion being going after a reward
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.320]   or the urge despite the risk.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.520]   Impulsivity is similar but different.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.640]   It's kind of going after something a little bit.
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.240]   If you model impulsivity in a mouse,
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:13.240]   it's related to going after a food reward
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:16.180]   without the sort of paired tone
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:18.180]   that the mouse is supposed to wait for.
[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:19.400]   The mouse doesn't want to wait anymore.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.440]   They just go after the food.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.360]   - I've been that mouse.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.520]   - Yeah, we all have been.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.920]   We can all relate with this to a certain extent.
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.120]   Again, it's the spectrum.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:33.120]   So in any case, non sequitur.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.960]   But I certainly think that there is a way
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.620]   to use our own body's physiology
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:45.360]   to anticipate when these impulses are coming online.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.940]   How best to do that,
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.640]   I think we're just scratching the surface.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.280]   But these are the kinds of solutions we need.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:57.440]   Some of these problems are of epidemic proportions.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.680]   The largest public health problems in this country,
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.080]   in this world, obesity, opiate crisis, depression,
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:05.560]   suicidality, I mean, that's like a third of our country,
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:07.920]   maybe more, probably more.
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:08.760]   And think about it.
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.720]   - And a colleague of ours at Stanford Psychiatry
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:13.180]   told me something that still just blows my mind,
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:18.180]   which is that something like 75% of the antidepressant
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:21.480]   and anti-anxiety medication that exists in the world
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.480]   is consumed in the United States.
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.300]   - That's amazing.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:26.500]   - Which is, I mean, that's an outrageous number.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.680]   - Yeah, we do have an obsession in this country for pharmacy.
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:32.940]   And the pharmaceutical industry is very powerful here
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.760]   and probably related to some aspect of capitalism.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.640]   I'm capitalistic and just like everybody else,
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.160]   but I do worry about that a little bit.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:44.740]   But we tend to over-prescribe
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:49.660]   and I think we, as patients, tend to over-want medication.
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:50.940]   We like quick solutions
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:53.060]   and sometimes medications provide it, sometimes not,
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:54.460]   or they're often just a band-aid.
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:57.120]   It depends on the problem, of course.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:02.120]   So, but I agree that we need scalable solutions.
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.840]   I'm a neurosurgeon.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.040]   I'm only gonna be able to treat the most severe of patients
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:08.220]   with these problems.
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:12.200]   We've only done about 200,000
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.440]   deep brain stimulation surgeries ever.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.220]   So, I mean, the problem we're talking about here
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.880]   is 50 million Americans.
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:24.580]   There's no possibility that surgeons can address that problem
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:28.060]   but we could help inspire an initiative
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:29.520]   to go after that kind of problem
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.360]   or help make it more rigorous
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:34.680]   because the last thing we need is some sort of wearable,
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:39.680]   fancy tool that wastes people's money and time.
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:42.240]   We need real therapies for these things.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.840]   Not that these devices that we're discussing are not.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:47.000]   I think actually there's lots of promise.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.980]   We use machine learning in the lab all the time.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:51.520]   I'm not an electrical engineer
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:54.080]   or the computational neuroscientist doing this type of work.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.360]   I just helped develop the hypotheses around it
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.340]   but, and help fundraise around it.
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.120]   But I definitely think there's a future for it.
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:03.460]   I just, I suspect we're scratching the surface
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.360]   on how best to do it.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.100]   - Let's talk about your hands.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:08.460]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:10.820]   - All the neurosurgeons I know are, you know,
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:13.500]   very faithfully protect their hands.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:14.340]   And let's talk about--
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.080]   - It's 'cause hand insurance is too expensive.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.680]   - That's right.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.720]   But I'm guessing that you all are not the ones
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:23.040]   to reach into the garbage disposal,
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.520]   even if your eye is on the switch
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.440]   to make sure that it isn't gonna get turned on.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.360]   They're just too precious.
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.660]   They are your livelihood.
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:31.920]   And earlier we talked about deadlifts.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.240]   There are other forms of exercise.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.980]   There are things like tennis.
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:38.880]   They're drawing and painting a full range of things
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.040]   that one can do with their hands.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.520]   Use your imagination, folks.
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:47.760]   - Is it true that neurosurgeons don't do any
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.400]   really like heavy grip activity
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:54.320]   because it can refine the motor circuits
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:55.920]   in the brain and elsewhere
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:59.640]   that can throw off their neurosurgery game?
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:03.320]   - I would say that many neurosurgeons
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:07.960]   avoid activities that put their hands at risk.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.120]   Another one, by the way, you know,
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:13.080]   there's an annual softball tournament
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:17.160]   that neurosurgeons come to in New York City,
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:19.220]   in Central Park, and play. - With a very softball.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.060]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:23.000]   - Well, actually, it's actually a very, you know,
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.360]   typical hard softball.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.800]   I don't know why they call it softball.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:29.120]   And actually, two close colleagues of mine
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.960]   have gotten injured at that tournament.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.840]   - Maybe this is, it's also, I must say,
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.280]   and here I'm poking fun,
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.280]   but for those of you who are going
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:38.620]   to the medical profession, it's also one of the more,
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:39.460]   how should I say this?
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:40.680]   Well, I'm just going to say it.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.740]   There's a steep hierarchy of training in neurosurgery.
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.580]   - Yes.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:47.180]   - There's a certain harshness that's been conveyed to me
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:50.180]   about the training, much like astronaut training,
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:51.540]   to be totally fair.
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:54.740]   And so maybe this is a tactic to weed out
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:57.700]   either the younger or the older generation.
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:58.740]   - This is evolution, right?
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:00.060]   We have to evolve.
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:02.960]   - We need medical training. - We have the week, I guess.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.960]   Well, I could say that one of the individuals
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.080]   that got injured is one of the more senior surgeons
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:09.740]   that I work with now and is one of the best athletes
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:11.520]   that I know, and he's definitely not weak,
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.660]   but you can get injured playing these sports.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.220]   And that being said, I can tell you briefly is,
[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:20.060]   I think that, you know, it's funny,
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:21.700]   my mother came to me recently.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:24.700]   She has osteopenia, and she told me,
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.700]   her doctor told her she's not allowed to do deadlifts.
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:30.460]   And I was like, okay, that's fine.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:31.940]   I'm not telling you you should do deadlifts.
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:34.440]   I just don't exactly understand the relationship.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.360]   But I can say that I do think,
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.780]   I'll give you a little story here.
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:42.580]   The reason why I'm being a little hesitant
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:45.220]   to confirm that I agree with you on the deadlifts is,
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:48.260]   when I was operating,
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:50.820]   this was when I was at Stanford University operating,
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.300]   and as I mentioned earlier,
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.940]   we get an intraoperative CAT scan
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:56.140]   to confirm accuracy of our lectures.
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.900]   I do this for all of my surgeries.
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:59.460]   When I was reviewing that CAT scan,
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:02.580]   the X-ray technician looked at me and said,
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:03.940]   whispered into my ear, he's like,
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:08.020]   "Your posture is really bad, it's embarrassing."
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:09.960]   - Your physical posture while doing your surgeries?
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:10.940]   - Yeah. - Uh-huh.
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.780]   - And I looked at him,
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:13.480]   and I kind of wanted to say I won't curse,
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:15.380]   but I, yeah, exactly.
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:17.600]   I've been doing it intermittently during our conversation,
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:19.000]   'cause he made me realize
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.780]   that I really did have bad posture.
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:23.800]   And we kind of had a little brief aside,
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.080]   and I learned he was a personal trainer,
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.860]   and his name was Zach.
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:32.100]   And he said to me, "Your posture is weak because,
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:34.220]   "or your posture is poor because you're weak.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:37.780]   "You need to strengthen your body and strengthen your core."
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:39.140]   I was like, "How?"
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:41.500]   He's like, "Powerlifting."
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.800]   And I'm like, "I'm a little hesitant to do this."
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.100]   And I'll tell you, I started very slowly,
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:48.060]   and I can't prescribe powerlifting to everybody
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:49.680]   for the exact reason you said,
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:52.360]   and I've gotten hurt doing it, by the way.
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:56.540]   But I do think, I wish I started a little younger,
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:59.940]   and I would argue that with close supervision
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:04.940]   and very well, if you have a very experienced trainer,
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:09.140]   which I would argue if you're a neurosurgeon or an astronaut,
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:11.260]   or have a highly specialized profession
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:15.060]   where you need your limbs to function,
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.300]   dentist, things like that,
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:18.420]   if you're gonna take something on like this,
[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:20.980]   it really needs to be extremely carefully supervised.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:24.300]   And I can tell you that my trainer had a profound impact
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:27.660]   on my life and my posture and my physical health.
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:30.820]   And so we did deadlift, I'll admit.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:33.140]   So when you brought it up, I kind of chuckled to myself.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:37.100]   But yes, I have gotten mildly hurt deadlifting,
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:38.460]   but it was when I was doing it by myself
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:41.100]   and I was kind of cocky and I wasn't paying attention.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:45.180]   But when I was with him and he was all over my technique,
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.780]   it actually was the most efficient way
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.320]   for me to feel stronger,
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:51.620]   and it improved my posture significantly.
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:54.060]   And I miss him since I left California.
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:56.140]   I have a new trainer in Philadelphia who's great,
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:59.500]   but, and I still deadlift occasionally with him,
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:04.380]   but I can say I am opposed to deadlifting callously.
[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:07.580]   But if you're extremely well monitored
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:11.180]   by an experienced personal trainer or weightlifter,
[01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:13.500]   I think it could be a great exercise.
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:16.500]   - Great, I'd love to be wrong in this case,
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.660]   because I'm a huge proponent,
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:20.080]   and on the podcast I go on and on.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:23.220]   I mean, there's so much data now pointing to the fact
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:27.860]   that 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio
[01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:30.200]   kind of jogging, cycling, swimming type behavior
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:31.740]   is very healthy for everybody,
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:33.700]   and we should all be doing that, at least that.
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:34.940]   - Yes, I need to as well.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:37.860]   - And that resistance training on the order of,
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:40.620]   you know, six hard sets per muscle group per week
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:43.820]   is really important just to offset deterioration of muscles.
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:44.740]   - I'm learning as we go here.
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:47.060]   - Skeletal function and tendon strength,
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:48.540]   and that's just to maintain.
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:51.020]   We're not talking about all outsets to absolute failure,
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:53.880]   but as you point out with proper form.
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:56.920]   So even the neurosurgeons are doing this,
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:59.600]   which I think is wonderful.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:04.600]   As a final question, but one that I think really,
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:06.780]   or maybe second to final question,
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:10.060]   earlier I commented on the remarkable calm,
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:13.580]   at least perceived calm of neurosurgeons.
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:16.700]   It could be cause or could be effect of the training,
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:20.900]   but it's obvious to me why one would want that trait
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:22.340]   in their neurosurgeon.
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:25.020]   I wouldn't want a hyperactive,
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:26.940]   certainly not an impulsive neurosurgeon,
[01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:30.860]   given that the margins of error are so, so tiny,
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:33.820]   the spatial scale, and probably on the temporal scale too.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:35.860]   You don't want people doing things in time
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:38.300]   that are being spontaneous at all.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:43.060]   Do you think that this branch of medicine that you're in
[01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:47.720]   selects for people that at least can know how to control
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:50.060]   any kind of fluctuations in autonomic arousal,
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:52.020]   they can calm themselves in real time?
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:53.420]   And here's a specific question,
[01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:55.700]   when I've never operated on the human brain,
[01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:57.080]   although I've had the privilege of being
[01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:58.660]   in the operating room and seeing this
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:01.220]   with some of our experiments with people in VR,
[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:02.780]   it's a remarkable thing.
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:04.820]   I wish for everybody that would get this experience
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:06.700]   at some point, not hopefully as a patient,
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:09.220]   unless they have a need, but to observe it.
[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:13.580]   But what was just striking to me is
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:17.940]   the various stereotype behaviors of the surgeon.
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:19.920]   And when I did surgeries as a graduate student,
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:22.600]   as a postdoc in the brains of other types of animals,
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:23.440]   I would find, for instance,
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:24.880]   that if I started to tremble a little bit,
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:26.820]   if I tapped my left foot,
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:28.760]   that my hand would stabilize a bit,
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:30.580]   that there's this kind of need to move the body,
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:31.540]   or one feels the impulse.
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:35.180]   Maybe that's my Tourette's-like compulsions again.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:39.600]   But that one can kind of siphon off some of that energy
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:42.640]   into another limb so that you could remain precise.
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:46.100]   So are these sorts of things that I'm talking about are,
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:47.920]   maybe it's entirely my imagination,
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:50.340]   but are these the sorts of things that one learns
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:54.180]   as a neurosurgeon how to still the body and still the mind?
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:55.760]   Do you have a meditative practice?
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.500]   When you go into the operating room,
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:59.780]   if you had a particularly challenging morning
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.580]   or a poor night's sleep,
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:04.780]   do you have tools that you use to calibrate yourself
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:06.700]   and get yourself into the zone?
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:08.220]   I think this would be very interesting
[02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:09.940]   for people to get some insight into,
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.740]   even if they don't want to be a neurosurgeon.
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:13.220]   - Yeah, I completely agree.
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:17.300]   And I appreciate the earlier reference to neurosurgeons
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:20.740]   as astronauts, 'cause I've also heard us
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.060]   compared to cowboys before,
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:23.920]   and it's a little bit less flattering.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:30.480]   Some of what we do surgically really does require
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.180]   a substantial amount of confidence.
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:36.500]   And that confidence hopefully comes from
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:39.060]   years of training and experience.
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:43.660]   You always worry that the confidence is sort of misplaced,
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:45.600]   and that is problematic.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.580]   Luckily, you so rarely see that,
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:50.240]   because our training is so rigorous.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.080]   We have a board of,
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.680]   American Board of Neurological Surgeons
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:59.680]   that sort of allows and assesses surgeons
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.140]   to continue practice and holds us to a really high bar.
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:08.660]   I do think it tends to attract a certain personality.
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:12.820]   In my subspecialty, as a deep brain stimulation surgeon,
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:15.620]   we call it stereotactic and functional neurosurgery.
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:16.800]   Some people have likened us
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:19.700]   to the neurologists with a scalpel.
[02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:21.660]   We tend to be a bit more intellectual.
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:27.700]   Maybe bedside manner is a little bit friendlier.
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:29.660]   And then there's the vascular neurosurgeon
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:32.060]   who doesn't sleep, and so they're not as friendly.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:34.900]   There's the spine surgeons who operate the most,
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.280]   and so they're busy, busy, busy.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.460]   There are some of these kind of reputations going around,
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:41.460]   but I agree with you.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:44.660]   There's a sort of a common feature of a calmness
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:47.840]   across neurosurgeons, and there's some of my,
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:50.920]   obviously my favorite people, my closest friends,
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.020]   and I can relate with them probably because of that.
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:56.540]   Sort of a big picture.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:59.540]   They don't get sort of flustered.
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:05.940]   They tend to be really good at figuring out
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:08.380]   how to have quality time, because we work really hard.
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.820]   Our hours are significant,
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:13.940]   and so the time with our families, our friends,
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:16.260]   is less than we would like it to be.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:19.180]   Obviously, that's true for people who work hard
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:20.180]   across any profession,
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:22.260]   but definitely true for neurosurgeons.
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:24.340]   And I think that we're very good at figuring out
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:26.160]   how to make that time high quality.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:30.780]   Even just texting with some of my friends
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:32.640]   that are neurosurgeons, a great friend of mine
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.380]   just became chairman at Duke,
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:38.300]   and just connecting with him by text, which takes seconds.
[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:40.340]   We feel connected.
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:43.900]   I think that's a trait amongst neurosurgeons.
[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:46.380]   We sort of know how to cut to the chase, in a way,
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:48.580]   and prioritize our time.
[02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:52.100]   It's a skill that we probably have innately,
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:53.780]   but it's also part of the training.
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:57.040]   When we are interns now, there's a lot of work hour
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.420]   regulations that is probably quite appropriate, by the way.
[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:05.420]   I think our hours before were bordering on not necessarily,
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:10.220]   let's just say they were not ideal for mental health,
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:13.900]   and sleep, which we know are very important components.
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:15.740]   Certainly, we had no time for meditation.
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:16.740]   I definitely did not.
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:17.840]   I wish I did.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:21.540]   Now, knowing what I know about meditation,
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:22.580]   my wife's a health coach.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:27.000]   I get it, I see it, I practice it myself with her.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.780]   I see the value.
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:30.760]   I wish I had that tool when I was in training,
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:31.960]   because it's stressful.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:35.140]   Even with the work hour restrictions,
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:36.260]   we still don't sleep very much.
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:39.700]   We're still at work a lot, about 80 hours a week.
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:41.900]   - Throughout the entire career?
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:43.180]   - There are times when it's more,
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:47.340]   because after training, there's no work hour restrictions.
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:51.100]   So sometimes I feel like as faculty, we get abused,
[02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:53.440]   and the trainees are a little bit more protected now.
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:55.540]   It definitely was the reverse at one point.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:58.580]   That's also a huge problem, probably more of a problem.
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:04:59.500]   And I'm joking a little bit.
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:01.180]   I don't necessarily think we're abused,
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:03.900]   but certainly our hours are significant.
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:08.900]   But they come a bit more here and there.
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:11.740]   On my OR days when I'm operating, those are long days,
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:15.020]   but on the days that I'm lucky enough to be a researcher,
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:17.940]   like you, those days tend to be a bit gentler,
[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:19.980]   unless I'm grant writing, those days can be long,
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:20.820]   as you know.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:23.940]   So to answer your question,
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:26.140]   I do think we're sort of self-selected for it,
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:28.520]   but I also think it's part of the training.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.820]   Because of the long hours that we're in the hospital,
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:33.060]   we're taking care of sick patients,
[02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:36.840]   and we have sort of a type A mentor approach,
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:39.360]   where our mentors are hard on us.
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:43.040]   We learn to cope with our stress and be efficient
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:47.440]   and prioritize things despite the stress of it all.
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:51.760]   And I think we take from that this sort of calm demeanor.
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:56.760]   And perhaps it just amplifies what we're probably drawn to,
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:59.580]   because before we come to neurosurgery,
[02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:01.280]   we might rotate in neurosurgery.
[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:05.240]   We might spend a month pretending to be a neurosurgeon,
[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:08.280]   learning from residents and faculty
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:10.120]   that are practicing the specialty.
[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:13.360]   But prior to actually starting your training,
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.940]   you never experience anything
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:17.840]   like being a resident in neurosurgery.
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:20.440]   The stress and the volume of patients
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:23.080]   that you have to take care of and the long nights.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.360]   It can be quite lonely, by the way.
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.800]   You develop friends in the hospital,
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.540]   but sometimes you're on your own when you're on call,
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:30.380]   and you have backup.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:32.920]   You can call your chief resident or your attending,
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:35.340]   but you really have to learn how to take care of patients
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:36.180]   yourself.
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:38.400]   You obviously form teams with nurses and staff
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.920]   and things like that and other residents,
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:41.360]   but it can be lonely.
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.820]   It can be really challenging.
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:45.240]   And I think because of those experiences
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:47.320]   that all neurosurgeons go through,
[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:54.720]   we tend to have this sort of unflappable personality
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.740]   that perhaps we started with a bit
[02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:58.820]   compared to the average person,
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:01.120]   but the training definitely amplifies it.
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:04.580]   And do you have tools that you implement
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:07.760]   if you ever feel that you're getting slightly off center?
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:08.660]   - I do now.
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:13.880]   When I was in training,
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:17.900]   I actually remember in my second year,
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:21.840]   so most neurosurgery programs when you're a junior resident,
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:24.820]   in some ways that's your toughest year, not in every way.
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:29.040]   It is your toughest year because you're young
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.320]   and you're inexperienced and you don't know
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.420]   what you don't know.
[02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:34.240]   And that's why it's such a tough year
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:36.320]   'cause you have to learn a lot very quickly
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:39.920]   for patient safety reasons, for self survival.
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:41.320]   You just have to learn a lot
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:44.640]   and you're on call by yourself in the hospital.
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:46.760]   And it's a real challenge.
[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:49.260]   And I think that I personally,
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.280]   I gained a lot of weight during that year.
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:54.560]   The only exercise I did consciously was taking the stairs.
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.160]   I refused to take the elevator.
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:08:00.240]   And I was at Penn at HUP where I currently practice now.
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.400]   And I remember I would see patients
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.200]   anywhere from sort of the ground floor
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:06.200]   where the trauma bay was or the ER
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:08.280]   all the way up to Founders 12th floor.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:09.700]   And I would never take an elevator.
[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.880]   That was my rule for the year
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.360]   'cause I knew I would not have time to exercise,
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:14.680]   but I would just take the stairs.
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:15.920]   And in the beginning of the year,
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:18.480]   I would be a little winded when I got to the 12th floor.
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:19.320]   But by the end of the year,
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:20.760]   actually it didn't really faze me
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.800]   and it became a great habit to have.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:25.120]   The problem with that though,
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:29.280]   is I paired that unfortunately with a lot of sleepless nights
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.400]   or not enough sleep let's say.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:33.760]   And I had this terrible habit
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:36.620]   of drinking coffee late at night
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:38.140]   and I would put a lot of sugar in it.
[02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:40.760]   And it was sort of the only way for me to get a quick,
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:43.800]   a quick bout of energy
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:46.600]   that for some reason I prioritized at that time,
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:49.020]   obviously knowing that I would crash, which I always did.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:51.320]   And I always kind of regretted it, but I still did it anyway.
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:56.320]   And I attribute that to poor decision-making, inexperience,
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.160]   and perhaps being a little vulnerable,
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:00.160]   like I think we all are.
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:02.960]   That's why I relate with a lot of the research that I do.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:05.400]   And I remember I got married in my third year,
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.000]   the year after my second year.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.600]   And my wife and I, or my fiance at the time,
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:11.880]   we started going to the gym together in the morning
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:13.700]   and my hours were a little better.
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:15.180]   So I would actually be able to exercise
[02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:16.920]   before I operated that day.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:19.420]   And I operated almost every day as a third year resident.
[02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:21.120]   So I remember I'd get to the gym really early
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.240]   and in three months I lost like 20 pounds
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:24.360]   and I wasn't trying to lose weight.
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:27.300]   I just was sleeping better and taking care of myself.
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.860]   And I remember when we got married,
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:32.660]   I fit into a tuxedo that I had in college,
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:33.720]   or it would have fit me in college.
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:35.240]   It actually was a new tuxedo admittedly,
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:37.440]   but it was the same size as my tuxedo from college.
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:41.360]   So I think that I've always related with the problems
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:43.840]   that our patients have to a certain extent.
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:47.200]   And when I've been most vulnerable,
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:49.200]   which is when I was working the hardest
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.260]   with the least amount of sleep,
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:51.760]   I related with it the most.
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:55.680]   And yes, exercise for me has always been my tool.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:00.820]   More recently, exercise, some strength training
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:03.560]   I think is important compared with cardio.
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.360]   I don't do enough of either,
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.820]   but I definitely do some and that helps.
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:09.160]   Meditation helps me a bit.
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:11.260]   I do that every night before I go to sleep.
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:14.260]   I use an app for it.
[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:16.440]   It's probably not the best way to do meditation, but-
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:17.820]   - If it keeps you doing it regularly,
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:19.400]   it's the best way to do it.
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:21.000]   - Andrew, I couldn't agree with you more.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:21.840]   It's one of those things
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:23.300]   where I look forward to it every night.
[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:26.840]   And sometimes my wife falls asleep
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.840]   and I come to bed a little later and I whisper,
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:30.540]   I'm like, "Are you okay if I turn the app on?"
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:34.000]   So she does the same to me 'cause I think we both value it.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.720]   And I think that's been very helpful.
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:38.960]   And I didn't have that tool probably when I needed it most,
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:41.720]   but I have it now and it's very helpful.
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:44.360]   - I really appreciate you sharing those tools.
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:46.860]   A number of people I'm guessing out there
[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:48.240]   might want to become neurosurgeons.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:50.880]   I really believe that in hearing today's conversation
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:53.360]   that you will spark an interest in medicine
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:55.500]   and or neurosurgery. - I hope so.
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:57.660]   - Well, certainly you need to be a physician
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:58.860]   before you can become a neurosurgeon.
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:00.840]   So end neurosurgery in some cases,
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:02.120]   and that would be beautiful.
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.640]   And I predict that will happen, excuse me,
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:07.960]   as a consequence of what you've shared today.
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.320]   I really appreciate your mentioning of the emphasis
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:15.720]   and appreciation on quality time.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:17.720]   I very much see this as quality time.
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:20.700]   I know that our listeners will as well.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:22.640]   Really want to thank you for taking time out of your,
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:25.160]   not just immensely busy, but very important schedule
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:27.440]   because again, the work that you're doing
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:30.920]   is really out there on that cutting,
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:31.920]   I don't want to say bleeding edge,
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:33.720]   'cause in this context it's not going to sound right,
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.000]   but on that extreme cutting edge of what we understand
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000]   about how the human brain works and how it can be repaired.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.540]   They're doing marvelous work.
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:44.120]   We will point people to various places
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:45.680]   they can find you online.
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:49.600]   And should they need the help of your clinic,
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.200]   to your clinic and your laboratory as well.
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:55.240]   So on behalf of everybody and myself as well,
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:57.120]   thank you so, so very much.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:57.960]   - I'm honored.
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.120]   Thank you so much for having me.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.160]   - Thank you for joining me today
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:02.340]   for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern
[02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:04.440]   about the use of deep brain stimulation
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:06.220]   and novel technologies for the treatment
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:09.460]   of eating disorders and movement disorders of various kinds.
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:10.560]   For those of you that are interested

[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:54.320]   Not so much today, but in many previous episodes
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.720]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:58.920]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:00.920]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:02.900]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:04.580]   and hormone optimization.
[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:06.040]   The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:07.240]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:08.320]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.800]   that the Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:12.280]   with Momentous on, you can go to Live Momentous,
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:15.760]   spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:17.680]   And there you'll see a number of the supplements
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:19.640]   that we talk about regularly on the podcast.
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:21.580]   I should just mention that that catalog of supplements
[02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:23.060]   is constantly being updated.
[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:24.000]   If you haven't already signed up
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.200]   for the Neural Network newsletter,
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:27.960]   this is a monthly Huberman Lab podcast newsletter
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:31.000]   in which you get some brief show notes summaries,
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.940]   as well as a lot of actionable tools in summary form.
[02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:36.880]   Many people find these very useful for distilling out
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:39.560]   the vast amount of information that we cover on the podcast.
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.880]   So for instance, if you go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.640]   you can click on the menu,
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:47.040]   click to Neural Network newsletter or simply newsletter,
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.000]   and you can sign up, just give us your email.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:50.880]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:53.180]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:55.320]   We also have examples of previous newsletters
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:56.480]   that you can download immediately
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:57.840]   without having to sign up for anything
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.520]   and decide whether or not you want to sign up.
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.080]   Again, that's the Neural Network newsletter
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:02.840]   at HubermanLab.com.
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:04.920]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:07.360]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, on Twitter,
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:11.020]   on Facebook, and on LinkedIn, and especially on Instagram
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:13.660]   and on Twitter, I cover many of the tools
[02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:15.360]   that are discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:17.200]   but also a lot of science and science-based tools
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:19.360]   not covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.600]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.280]   Once again, thank you for joining me today
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:25.260]   for my discussion with Dr. Casey Halpern.
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:27.360]   I hope you learned as much as I did.
