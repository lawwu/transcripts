[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100]   even if you can regularly find ways
[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.500]   to get two or even 10 cents of value,
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.940]   booking, business class travel,
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.640]   staying at luxury properties,
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.260]   you probably shouldn't use those points values
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.940]   when you're comparing the points values
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.940]   you earned on credit cards with cash back
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.980]   because you can always find ways
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.300]   to effectively buy those same points,
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.820]   whether it's buying through airline and hotel programs
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.900]   when they go on sale,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420]   and then you can actually get that same
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.540]   two to 10 cents of value.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.080]   So this was a really big change
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.260]   in the way I thought about things
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.980]   because the reason I loved credit card points in miles
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.020]   was that they let you take travel
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.100]   that would otherwise be much more expensive
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100]   and get access to it for much less,
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.500]   but it's not actually earning the points in miles
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.580]   that makes it the better deal,
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.740]   it's actually just having them.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.660]   So if you could go out any time of day
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.340]   and just buy chase points for one cent per dollar,
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.380]   which you can't, but if you could,
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.140]   I wouldn't need to earn chase points at all
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.100]   'cause I would just buy them
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.860]   right before I was about to book a flight,
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.820]   and if for some reason I wanted to take a trip
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.180]   and the points weren't an option,
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080]   then I wouldn't buy the points and I would have to pay cash.
