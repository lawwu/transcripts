[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.360]   - Well, happy new year.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.440]   As we enter 2019 on this podcast,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.680]   our seventh year now of Pastor John,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.880]   you're about to head off to the cross conference
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.080]   in Louisville, which begins a Wednesday night.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.600]   Over 7,000 are registered, which is super encouraging,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.480]   and I just pray that God would bless the conference
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.960]   and he would use it to raise up hundreds of missionaries
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.000]   that will give their lives to the nations.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.720]   Which is what the conference is about.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.760]   There, Pastor John, you're going to deliver
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.000]   a missionary biography and a plenary session.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.800]   But before you head off to the airport,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680]   we're talking about Bible reading in 2019.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.280]   And here's today's question.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.160]   Hello, Pastor John, I am Kennedy from Uganda.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.640]   I have been listening to your sermons
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.920]   and I thank God for using you to impact our lives
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.420]   through the word that you preach.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.400]   My question, whenever I'm reading the Bible,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.580]   I find it hard to understand what the author intended
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.800]   for me to understand when he wrote it.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280]   Currently, I'm doing my devotions in the book of Genesis,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.840]   but I so often find myself totally blank
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.760]   after I've read a text.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.520]   What's the first basic skill in Bible reading
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.480]   to find meaning for myself?
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.080]   - Now, I know that our friend from Uganda
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.440]   is asking about the first basic skill
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.080]   to use his language in Bible reading.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.720]   But based on the description of what's happening
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.260]   when he reads, I want to come at his question
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.360]   a little differently.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.800]   Instead of giving just one basic skill,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.520]   since I don't think that's the key
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.400]   when in our devotions we find ourselves blank,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.520]   which he says he does, he's not the only one, by the way.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.240]   It's not just a problem for beginners,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.280]   but for me as well at times.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.720]   So let me point to three things that are essential
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.800]   to ongoing fruitful encounter with God
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.840]   and his intended truth through the Bible.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.400]   And I can describe these three things
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.740]   that I hope will be helpful in three ways.
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.640]   I could call them motivation, skill, and illumination,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.120]   or I could call them the want to,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.000]   and the able to, and the see-through.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Or I could call them the desire, and the act,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.920]   and the reward of Bible reading.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   So let me suggest a brief word about each one
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.480]   in the hope that God will create them in us,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   even as I speak.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.120]   First, a word about motivation.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   If we lose motivation, we will not read the Bible,
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.180]   and if we don't read the Bible,
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.200]   we miss everything God has for us through the Word.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.660]   And I was just reading yesterday in John 17,
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.580]   which is Jesus' prayer for the disciples,
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.660]   and I saw a cluster of precious things
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.620]   that are owing directly to hearing the Word of Jesus,
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.620]   which motivated me tremendously to want to read the Bible.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.940]   So in verse 13, Jesus said, "These things I speak
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.080]   "in the world that you might have my joy
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.980]   "fulfilled in yourselves."
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.980]   So there is a fullness of joy that we will miss
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.100]   if we don't continually listen to what Jesus speaks,
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.520]   that is, listen to the Bible.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.940]   And I think that principle holds for the whole Bible,
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.360]   not just the words of Jesus in the Gospels.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.180]   Second, Jesus prays in John 17,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.380]   "Father, sanctify them in the truth.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.460]   "Your Word is truth."
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.660]   So the second thing we're gonna miss
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.660]   if we don't feed on the truth of the Word is sanctification.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.340]   God has designed that we be made more holy,
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.900]   more sanctified by the truth.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.940]   And then he says, "God, your Word is truth."
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.360]   And third motivation was in verse 20, where he says,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.240]   "I don't ask for these only,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.080]   "but for those who will believe in me through their Word."
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.500]   So how do we come to believe?
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.060]   How do we keep on believing?
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.080]   We believe through the Word,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.940]   through the Word of the apostles.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.820]   And where's that found?
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.900]   It's found in the Bible.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.900]   So three powerful motivations to read our Bibles,
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.660]   if you want faith, if you want holiness, if you want joy,
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.660]   they all, Jesus says,
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.660]   come through encountering God in his Word.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.500]   That's how we get motivated.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.700]   We want these things and therefore we want the Word.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.780]   So that's the first of my three essentials,
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.780]   which I know our friend didn't even ask about,
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.720]   but I think it's just absolutely crucial
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.980]   that we see how to motivate ourselves
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.460]   because if we go blank when we're reading the Bible,
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.100]   we quickly lose motivation.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.860]   Now, just a sentence about each of the other two.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.260]   So the first is motivation.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.220]   The second is skill, the ability to read.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.500]   Here's my single suggestion,
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.120]   and there's lots more in my book,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.300]   "Reading the Bible Supernaturally."
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.280]   Lots and lots of practical things
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.700]   about how to beef up your natural skill
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.820]   in getting meaning from the Bible.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.700]   But here's the one thing I wanna say here.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.900]   Something mysterious happens
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.980]   when we pick up a pen or a pencil, not a keyboard,
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.940]   but a pen or a pencil,
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.720]   and we either write out the text,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.500]   or if it's too long,
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   write down questions you have or observations you make
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.900]   about the things that you're reading in the text.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.460]   And you may think, our friend in Uganda may think,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.540]   well, good grief, that's just gonna record my ignorance.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.900]   I'm asking for help to see.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.340]   And I say, no, no, no, that's not true.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.940]   No, it won't just record your ignorance.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.940]   Writing down the text causes you to have thoughts
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.900]   you wouldn't have otherwise had.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.900]   Asking questions which you write down causes your brain
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.480]   to have thoughts you wouldn't have otherwise had.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.120]   So that's my one single suggestion for him
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.620]   to make progress in the skill category.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.860]   And here's the last one.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.660]   The third of these essentials is illumination.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.820]   That's a gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.140]   He causes God himself, his character, his will,
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.580]   his ways to shine through the scriptures.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.060]   And the key to having this illumination is prayer.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.100]   And I say that because in Ephesians 1:18, Paul prays for it.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.500]   He prays that the eyes of their heart would be illumined.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.220]   So pray for illumined reading.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.020]   So whether it's our friend in Uganda
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.180]   or anywhere else in the world, my prayer is,
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.180]   may God grant strong motivation, increasing skill,
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.540]   and bright, transforming illumination
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.140]   in all of our Bible reading in 2019.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.500]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John,
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.100]   for preparing us for the year ahead.
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.180]   And we need to let you go to the airport.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.580]   We'll be praying for the cross conference
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.420]   and for your time there as well.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.860]   You know, in the history of this podcast,
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.500]   we've now surpassed 1,300 total episodes.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   Thank you for your interest
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.780]   and for your questions over the past years.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.980]   You can search all those episodes, read full transcripts,
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.700]   and send us your own questions, all at our online home,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.220]   DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.620]   Friday, we return with another great Bible question.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.460]   Here it is.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.540]   If I have 60 minutes each day for reading,
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.220]   how much of that time should be Bible reading?
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.660]   Spoiler alert, Pastor John is gonna say, "Not 60 minutes."
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.820]   He'll explain why on Friday.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.220]   I'm your host, Tony Reiki, and we'll see you then.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.820]   (gentle music)
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.420]   (gentle music)
