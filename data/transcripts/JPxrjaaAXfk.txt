[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   A listener named Kevin writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, what does Jesus mean when he says in John 16, 1,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   'I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away'?"
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Jesus said, just like Kevin pointed out, John 16, 1,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   "I have said these things to you to keep you from falling away."
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And in the next verses, he says that suffering is coming,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and really perplexing suffering. Verse 2, "You will be put out of the synagogues.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he's serving God."
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Now, in those kind of situations, we can easily feel like, "God, where are you? Have you forsaken me?"
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And he's already said, Jesus already said in verse, I mean, chapter 15, "Remember," this is 1520,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   "Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.'
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   If they persecuted me, they will persecute you."
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So what Jesus is saying is that his words, my words, his warnings, his promises,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   are his means of preserving our faith in these painful situations.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   For example, he said in verse 13, just before chapter 16 started, 15, 13,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "Greater love has no one than this, than that someone lay down his life for his friends.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   You are my friends if you do what I command you.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn't know what his master's doing,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   but I have called you friends for all that I have heard from my Father I've made known to you."
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So when we enter persecution, we're supposed to remember his words.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   "I loved you. I gave myself for you. This is the greatest love I could possibly show for you.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I died for you. You are my friend. You are not a slave.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I have taken you into the inner councils of the Godhead."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   When we're persecuted, we're supposed to remember these things,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and in remembering these things, he keeps us from falling away.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So it will not be easy to believe in the midst of persecution
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   that God loves us when we're being tortured for his name.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It won't be easy to feel loved when you languish in prison.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It won't be easy to feel loved when you're abandoned by friends.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   But Jesus says, "I have spoken to you to help you keep your faith.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So may my words sustain you. May my words be the ropes by which I bind you to myself."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So here's where Kevin may be stumbling.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   He may have the idea that eternal security means we don't need to fight the fight of faith.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Or he may think that eternal security may mean that Jesus has made us secure
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   and doesn't need to do anything more to keep us secure.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Now, I think both of those ideas are mistaken.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We are eternally secure as his children.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   But the way we are eternally secure is that Jesus has promised to keep us secure.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   His present and future keeping are as important as any past purchase of us.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And the way he keeps us is by bringing his words to mind
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   and helping us see them as true and beautiful and trustworthy and sufficient for all our needs.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So eternal security then is not like a vaccination that we received when we were six
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and don't have anything to do with now.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   No, it's like an ongoing therapy regimen.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And our doctor, Jesus, promises never, never, never to leave us,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   but always to help us and to keep us.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And thus our therapy, our ongoing daily therapy,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   is the means by which we are preserved and kept.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And his words are an essential part of that.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So our part is to trust him every day that he knows what he's doing in this sometimes very painful therapy.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And he has spoken to us so that we have promises to trust and warnings to heed.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So, Kevin, we are secure, but we are as secure as the promises of God,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   as sure as they are true and as sure as they are secure.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And Jesus is faithful to us today and forever.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That's what our security lies in,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   the ongoing keeping of Jesus, applying his word to our life and holding on to us with them.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you, Kevin, for the excellent question.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Related to this topic is episode number 102, which is titled, "Can a Born-Again Christian Lose Salvation?"
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Check that out. That's episode number 102.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Well, Monday, we will return to this topic of eternal security and ask,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   "How can eternal security be both certain and also conditional at the same time?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Can it be both?" You won't want to miss that episode.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Until then, like Kevin did, email your questions to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org
