[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other thing.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   In any particular sport, with well-defined rules, mastery is achieved through specialization.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Taking a few skills and perfecting them.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   So naturally, most experts and teachers of movement are specialists.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Of skill sets like gymnastics, hand balancing, Olympic lifting, capoeira, jiu-jitsu, wrestling, judo, and other martial arts.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   So it's rare to come across a generalist. Someone who takes a holistic approach to movement.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   My guest today is Ido Portal.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   He is a guru of movement. A teacher with a large and quickly growing following.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   As he says, "Movement is big. Bigger than any specific discipline."
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   We're all human first, movers second, and only then specialists.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I actually just finished reading a biography of Albert Einstein by Walter Isaacson.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And the two of you have something in common.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   A desire to arrive at a unified theory.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   In his case, it was a unified theory of physics. You know, like forces of nature.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   In your case, it's a unified theory of movement.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Can you tell me the story of your journey to becoming a generalist?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   First, I'll just say that I'm no guru, you know.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's something that people use, but I have a really hard time with the word "master" or "guru."
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And I didn't arrive at the gospel truth, or I'm not sitting on any mountains.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I'm on my way. So people who join me as students are basically following, you know, in the same journey.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Maybe in certain circumstances I'm a bit further ahead, or sometimes I'm a bit behind.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   But it's definitely a walk along and not walk behind kind of thing.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Yeah, my journey. I started as a mover first, and then I became a specialist.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And then I went back to movement, basically.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So it all started at a young age, and some Chinese martial arts developed into some physical sports and games in school, primary school and high school.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And then I met Capoeira, and I was completely amazed, basically, by this art form.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And I pursued that for a good 15 years.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   In the middle, somewhere, military service and other physical pursuit.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And throughout changing and developing and moving between disciplines and exploring,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I just kind of got the same realization again and again that there is some thread through all these disciplines,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and there is something that is attracting me back.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And basically it was movement, I realized.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And the next thing was, okay, I want to learn movement, I want to get better as a mover in a general way.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I seeked out movement teachers and went around the world and looked around and read a lot of books.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And there were some people who mentioned the word movement.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And I went to them and offered myself as a student, and they kept on teaching me disciplines and other isolated approach and other speciality.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And I was very disappointed.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So eventually I decided, okay, I'm going to become that person.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'm going to become the movement teacher.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And the next realization after years and years of trying was it's impossible.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And with that I stayed basically because I realized if that's impossible, it's a good goal to have in life.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Something that will keep on moving myself and my students and anybody involved forward.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   That's where I'm at right now.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'm teaching and learning, moving around and trying to gain some more knowledge about this impossible task.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yes, so you're still yourself or forever a student?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I prefer to be a student any day of the week than a teacher.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   But being a teacher is part of human culture.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   We are all teachers.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We teach all the time.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Whether you want it or not, somebody asks you for direction in the street, you become the teacher.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You have a child, he looks at you, you're a teacher.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Practicing, teaching and practicing to the student, the discipleship, both of them are extremely important for your development as a mover.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   What is the price of specialization?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   What do we lose when we specialize?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   We lose humanity first and foremost.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   As humans we evolved to become humans as generalists.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   We are the most generalist of all animals.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   We're able to imitate the ape and imitate the tiger.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   We can hold our breath underwater and we can do everything just a tiny bit.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   We can't really run very fast.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We can't really fight very well.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We can't climb as good as other animals.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   But we can do the most complex and generalized tasks out of all animals.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   No animal even comes close.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Speciality, the price is humanity.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   The price is your happiness.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   The price is your fulfillment as a human being.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   It's deep, it's philosophical, but that's who we are.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Do you think there is some beauty in fulfillment, some value in specialization, in becoming the best at a very specific movement, at a particular sport?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Giving your body to, dedicating it to that sport?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That's an interesting thing because as a human race, we benefited tremendously from the work of specialists.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But those specialists suffered.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   That's a very, very important point.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's like without specialists we would never be here.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   We would never be Skyping right now on these computers and wearing these t-shirts and all kinds of stuff.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But those specialists, those human beings suffered the result of their highly specialized nature.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And we become more and more specialized.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   There is a move towards being generalist again in the last few years, maybe the last decade.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   There is a bit more talk about that.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   But definitely we are also still pursuing highly specialized fields.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I make a joke in my workshop and I say, nowadays you go to a, if you break your hand, you go to a hand specialist, an orthopedic surgeon.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   In five or ten years, you'll go to a left hand specialist.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And the most evident problem is also our leaders who are ex-specialists.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But now they're required to be generalist leaders of a lot of stuff.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And they're shitty leaders.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   We keep on having the same problems again and again because they are ex-specialists.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Whether it's a lawyer or a military person or an economist.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   These are not specialties that allow you the full grasp of running a country.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Yeah, I think you put it beautifully that in my specialization, my lead to innovation, but you lose the humanity.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   What do you find is the most underdeveloped range of motion in athletes?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   What movement is most restricted in high level athletes in your experience?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Is there one that stands out? Shoulders? Any particular other joints?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Well, it all depends on their speciality, of course, and habits.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   The shoulder, the glenohumeral joint, is the most hypermobile joint in the body.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Even when it's restricted, it still offers tremendous range of motion compared to other areas.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   But when it's restricted, even if it's just a little bit, it can cause huge problems.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Because we are dependent on that range of motion and mobility around the glenohumeral joint.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And the simple reason is because with the hands, humans manipulate.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   That's what we're meant to do with our hands. And we need that complexity around the scapula.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It's been a few years since I've said it first, that the scapula craves complexity.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   But this complexity around the scapula and range of motion is so important across the board.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I've read of your concept of isolate, integrate and improvise.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Can you describe the role of improvisation in movement?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Any profession, any speciality should arrive at improvisation in the top tier, the top level.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Whether you play the violin or you box, you're going to reach improvisation.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Improvisation above all is the human condition. It's the human ability.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   The highest form of living is improvisation. You improvise. Basically, life is improvisation.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   You're born, you die and in between you improvise. A shitload of improvisation.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Movement is no different.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   The thing is people started to isolate concept and some people went to the next level and integrated them.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   They present themselves as improvisation, but actually they're cheating people.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It's just a bit more integration yet. It's just another integration.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Improvisation, open improvisation, real improvisation as we call it, that's very rare.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And that's the most enjoyable state. It's also called the zone. It's also called the tunnel.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You just experience this beautiful thing to be empty, just to let things happen through you.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   As Bruce Lee said, "I don't hit, it hits." It just happens.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And that is improv. That's what you need to do with movement if you aspire for the highest things.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I like how a guy on Reddit described you as "Ido Porto may not be the nicest guy in the world, but he's a great coach."
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So that nicest guy part, I come from the wrestling world where the goal of a good coach and a good program
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   is to basically make you quit, to break you.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   There's zero patience for people who don't want to put in the work, to work hard.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Do you find that tough love is the best approach to coaching people, whatever their level of ability?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   No, not necessarily. I don't like the term tough love
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   because it kind of assumes that its importance is itself.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   It's not enough for me. It's like, that's the best way. Why? That's the best way.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   But on the other hand, I don't think people are made of sugar.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I really believe that we've lost a bit of sight of how resilient we are.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And another is people don't like the truth.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It's dishonesty is above all.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So when people describe me as tough love, it's not because I believe in tough love.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   100% of the people who have had issues with me on a personal level or through coaching
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   are people who couldn't accept criticism, what I offered, took it personally,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   who weren't able to deal with it, etc.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I can't even, you know, in my head find one example of a person I've been working with
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   who received the criticism, worked with it and still complained.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   But it's always these complainers and who fucking cares?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Complain first and do nothing, yes.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Yeah, yeah. You know, it's like when you go mainstream, as we've went to a certain level,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   you deal with it because I'm not operating my elite unit, my special op unit anymore.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Now it's an army and I need to accept the fact that I'm going to meet a lot of slackers,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   a lot of fucking poindexters and all kinds of, you know, they don't want to work,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   they want to talk about it, they want to do this, they want to do that.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   They don't want to hear the truth, they don't want to accept criticism
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   or hear how much they suck.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And I just don't do that.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   So, you know, I'll have to accept the fact that from now and again, you know,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I'll have this issue and I'm sure it will continue.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You've traveled all over the world.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Do you think there's a difference in this aspect, in attitudes in the United States,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   in Israel and other countries?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Of course, big time.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Yeah, there are many countries where I don't have this issue or very rarely.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   We have a word in Hebrew, it actually comes from German, I think, or Yiddish.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It says "tachles".
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's like "down to it", you know, the heart of it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   "Tachles" people are people who are like, "No bullshit, you know, directly,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   tell me as it is."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And this "tachles", it exists in certain cultures.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   In other cultures, it's a lot of chit-chat and walk around and, you know,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I didn't know how to chit-chat.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   A few days ago, one of my students told me, you know, "I can't chit-chat."
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It's exactly how I felt, you know.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   When I first came out of Israel, started to teach around, it was Russia,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   thank God, and that was so similar to where I come from in many ways,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   so no problem.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   But then when I went to the U.S. or Canada, I had a lot of issues with the chit-chat,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   with politically correct and walking around the bush and don't give it to me
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   too harshly, you know, cover it with a lot of sponges around it,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   soften the heat, and yeah, it's definitely different between various countries
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and I need--nowadays, I need filters, which are my top students
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   who are helping me teach, and some of them are great filters,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and in certain countries, they'll do much better than me.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   What does perfect practice look like for you?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So do you believe in the value--maybe this applies more to specialized sports,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   but I come from Russia, actually, and from the wrestling world
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   where repetition, putting in 10, 50,000, 100,000 repetitions on a specific movement
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   is how you achieve success.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Do you believe in the value of that repetition, even for a generalist framework?
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Repetition is the mother of skill.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   There have been those that corrected and said, "Perfect repetition is the mother of skill."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Well, those who usually say it are those who don't achieve heights, usually.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So I'll be very frank. Again, I'll be very extremely honest.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   A lot of people talk about perfect, perfect, perfect, but life is not perfect itself.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Our surroundings are not perfect.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And when I practice and when I move, it's never on the perfect conditions.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It's never with the right optimal blood sugar level and under the specific height of I don't know what
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   and riding the wave of super compensation in the perfect way.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And usually, when people try to adhere to that concept in a perfect way,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   they end up falling off the wagon.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   On the other side, don't be stupid. Don't just drill yourself into the wall and lose sight of everything.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   It's not black and white.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   The truth is somewhere in between, and it varies between people.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   For me, after 17 years teaching, 18 years now teaching, moving, seeing people,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   the hardest workers are usually the elite performers.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Of course, some of them are carrying a certain talent or this or that,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   but it's always with very dedicated practice.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   They have built up that work capacity through that dedicated practice,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   and they can then move that ability to other disciplines.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   True.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   In the grappling world, I'm not sure how much you're aware of it,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   but Marcel Garcia is one of the greats, and he believes boldly against the status quo, I think,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   that you should only train his sport, Jiu-Jitsu, and not do anything else.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   To achieve success, train only that.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But the majority of other athletes in the sport believe that you should do strength and conditioning programs around that,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   so they at least move slightly towards the more generalist framework.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Do you think there's value for the generalist mindset for an elite athlete,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   or should they just focus on their sport?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   To some level, to some level.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Speciality can reach a plateau because of lack of general base of the pyramid in some cases,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   but it's not a very high level of generalism.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Nowadays, you're practicing against specialists,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and they devote more and more time to this speciality when you're doing other stuff.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So it's a complex riddle, and to each case, his own.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I'll tell you something else.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   When you reach the top of your field, like Marcelo Garcia did in BJJ,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   you stop being inspired by your own scene.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   You can't gain inspiration, knowledge, and motivation from your own scene,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   because you are the leader.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   You're on top of the mountain.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   You have nowhere else to climb.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   So what do you do?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   You look to other scenes.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And that's where it's really, really valuable to become a bit more generalized.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Yes.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   You mentioned in an interview related to that a very interesting point,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   that many people in the U.S. in particular focus on learning more than doing.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So focus too much on acquiring knowledge versus using that knowledge.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Do you struggle with this yourself?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   How do you approach learning new things versus putting more time into old things
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   that you've already mastered?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   It's a good question.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It's not only a U.S. thing or a North American thing.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It's generally all across the globe, although there are more practical people
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and less practical people, and each country has its own orientation, habits,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   characteristics, but it's a good question.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It's kind of being super intelligent and oriented towards the information,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   but then have this dumbed-down practical mind.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   It's like, "Okay, now I need to work," and having a balance across that.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And that probably means that a certain IQ, for example,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   will start to work against you in certain fields and vice versa.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   So when you become too much, as the Chinese say,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   "The man who lives inside his head," you start to have this issue.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   You have a thirst for information, great thirst, but information is toxic.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   It's exactly like water.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Water is toxic as well.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Almost all compounds are toxic.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   And then we drink, we drink, we drink, we kill ourselves.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   We kill the process.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   The knowledge, it turns against us, and that's a serious problem,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   and that's the problem of the age of misinformation that we live in.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It's not only that the knowledge is toxic even when it's good knowledge.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Now we also have bad knowledge, mostly bad knowledge, mostly shitty advice.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   The combination is lethal, and just people become paralyzed
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   or just move from link to link to link with glazy eyes
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   and just never actually do anything.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Yes. I know you advocate building a huge work capacity.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   So how many hours a day do you think--this is also a debate for specialists--
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   how many hours a day do you think is the most a person can train movement intelligently
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   before it becomes not sustainable, before their mind becomes uninspired, maybe as you said?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   24 hours.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   24 hours.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   24 hours a day.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   There is a choreographer in Israel, a very known choreographer called Dohad Naharim.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   He says when you wake up in the morning in bed between the sheets,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   you can practice movement, and he's not talking about with your partner.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   So even there you can practice breathing, moving.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   It's all the time around you, but serious practice,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   practice oriented repetition and success and building skill
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and moving from isolation to integration to improvisation.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   In most disciplines, it's around six to eight hours a day.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Some people go more and reach even the 10-hour mark,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and I've done that for periods of time in the military.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   You go even further than that.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Other disciplines require less, and it's also a highly individual thing.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   So let's say even within the sports of gymnastics,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   you have a woman like Nastia who trains eight hours a day,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   and next to her in the same team, also winning gold medals,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   at the same level more or less, you have Shawn Johnson training three hours a day,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   and she reached the top of her field, gold medal in the Olympics.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   So how highly individual?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   This is very rare to see, this three-hour gold medal thing,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   but definitely it exists.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   The difference there might be mental.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   So the question I have is out of the various elements like mind, breathing,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   developing muscular strength or joints,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   which is the biggest challenge to master as a student of movement?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Highly individual.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   It depends on the person, depends on his orientation.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Some people never require any form of mental training, for example,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   or psychological training, especially in fields like sports and team sports.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So that aspect is covered.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   They're winners, they're oriented, they're focused, you know,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   and other people require help in that regard.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Some people have great difficulty developing mobility
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   and just the nervous system is panicked, it holds on, it protects them too much.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Other people are hypermobile and have a difficulty creating tonus and strength,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   and that is a great challenge for them.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And other people are, you know, great complex learners.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   They can coordinate complex actions and learn movement very quickly,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   while others are highly limited.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   So it's very individual.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   So that process of learning, that journey is individual to everyone.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   So how does one take that journey?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Just listen to your own body?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   No, no, you can listen to your body until tomorrow.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   But, yeah, you're not hearing anything, you know.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   You're not hearing anything.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   You need to learn, you need to create a relationship with your body,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and you need the help of teachers.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   There is only--you know, a lot of people say, "I'll do it myself."
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Then you deny collective knowledge, the most powerful knowledge that mankind holds,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   you know, because we're the only animal that have collective knowledge.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   We've been able to move knowledge across generations,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and that's how we have reached space, build the Internet, you know,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   do all these crazy surgeries, and, you know, solve, you know, genetic issues, et cetera.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You're not going to do it by yourself.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   You are just one small person,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   and we have collected knowledge generations upon generations.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   So listen to your body.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   That's nice to say.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Most people don't hear shit.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   It's completely silent,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and you need to start to decipher the signals that the body gives you,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and that goes through practice and learning discipleship
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and exploring a lot of different stuff, and it's a highly individual thing.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Nowadays, we don't have so much anymore this mentor-student or teacher-disciple relationship,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   but I really believe in that.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I wouldn't be here without my mentors and my teachers,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   the shoulders of giants that lifted me up.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   I still believe in it in a way.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   There is no other way.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   On that, do you think that training and learning movement,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   for the majority of the time, is a fundamentally solitary activity,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   or do we gain from, like, the presence of others?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So when you think of movement when you're training,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   is most of your training, like the repetitions, done alone or with others?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Both.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I've trained years, you know, alone and with my students,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   and I spend large periods of time alone, just training alone,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   but I also spend a lot of time being in a community,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   and movement is the best reason for gathering around in a community.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   You know, people, for example, nowadays, they go do CrossFit or they do yoga or whatever,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   and then they have their yoga friends and they have their real friends.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   That's bullshit, you know?
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Your yoga friends can't be your real friends,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   because we've been gathering around movement since the age of time,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   creating communities around movement, around hunting, gathering, dancing around the fire.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   We've been moving together.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Nowadays, I can recommend move with your loved ones, move with the people around you.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   You know, you join a BJJ club, it's a community.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   You know, you go there, you meet, you move around.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   You go to a capoeira club, it's a tribe.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   You go to a CrossFit gym, it's a community.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   You go to yoga, it's a community.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You can move with your children, you can move with your dog in the park.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I think it's important to move together, but it can also be done alone,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and some things are better done alone, and some things are better done together.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   How do you think movement changes from solo movement,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   you know, that whole pattern of movement where you're moving alone,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   versus the pattern of movement where there's two people,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   either working together or against each other?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   So together is like dancing, partner dancing,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and against each other is like wrestling or jiu-jitsu.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Do you think the principles of movement are different
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   for when it's two people versus one person?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Is this a whole other world?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   First, I spend more time moving with others against others in martial arts
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   because I spend most of my life in martial arts,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and less time exploring stuff alone.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   But definitely there are some concepts that still exist,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   like the quality of movement, how you organize your body in space,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   not in relation to the partner only,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   but first a BJJ practitioner or a stand-up fighter,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   he needs to organize his body in relation to space first,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   and then in relation to the partner as well.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   So some of the concepts exist in both, while others are very different,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   and you can train alone all your life,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   when somebody else is in the equation, it's going to change the game completely.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   A major reason why we are under the fight laboratory,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   we've departed in reality from a lot of traditional martial arts,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and the delusions of training alone and doing forms,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and repetitive movements alone,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   and then it's a shitstorm.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   You can't apply anything, and you don't have any live practice.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And now we see that definitely in the fight game.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   The practices that stayed very real, stayed very dirty in a way, but very real,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   they are the ones who are providing tools for the chaotic environment of a fight.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   In terms of injury, how do you treat, recover, and work around injury?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Injuries are a certainty, they're not a probability.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Injuries and diseases, they are also required.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   As Nassim Taleb, one of my biggest inspirations these days, a great philosopher,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   in order to anti-fragilize, to become anti-fragile, to become robust,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   to become more than resilient, you must be able to enjoy volatility.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   You must be able to grow from this stuff.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   First, I said it before and I'll say it again, I injure my students.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   This happens, and I can't do anything beneficial without it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Basically, we all get injured constantly,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   on a micro-level, on a macro-level, it's part of our lives.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Of course, we don't want to push into meaningless injury,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and we want to be able to grow from it and basically develop from it.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   How do you train around it?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   How do you train around it? It's a hard question.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   It involves a lot of stuff.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   First, I'm a big believer in movement as a therapeutic tool.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Movement itself, if it offers you adaptation, and it does,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   it's the way out, not lack of movement.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Rest, I don't believe in rest. I believe in moving.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Which means, when I'm resting, I might help on the short term
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   with certain aspects of the injury, but at the same time,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I'm creating a new problem because the adaptive process is taking me somewhere else.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   I'm not recovering towards movement, I'm recovering towards no movement.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   So, we have a problem here.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Now, in some cases, you must rest, and then deal with the consequences later.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   But in most cases, there is a better approach than just resting,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   and that requires a lot more taking responsibility,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   which doctors don't believe in your ability to take responsibility for yourself.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   To be intelligent, and to know the amounts and the levels,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   and that requires some form of knowledge and experience,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   and most people can't be trusted with it, so we offer them this advice of just rest.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Rest, stop.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But definitely, after years and years of working with people,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and taking them through crazy injuries,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   my right hand, Odelia, she went through a car accident,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   she lost a kidney, she broke her back, she went through three knee surgeries,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   which my sister performed, by the way.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Nowadays, she can move like few people I know on this planet,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   and just the answer was always movement, movement, going back into movement.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Beautiful. Continue, move.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Continue to move, yeah. Don't move stupidly, don't hurt yourself.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   But that's obvious, no? I guess not, because when I say these things,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   people write a fucking comment.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   The bot, the bot people, you know, "Yeah, bot, you're going to injure yourself."
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Yeah, genius.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Don't go into the injury and again, deteriorate, escalate the situation.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Of course not. You must move around it,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   and you must be smart in the way that you allow adaptation to take you out like a wave.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   You need to ride the wave of adaptation out of the problem.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And that's tricky, we know, and that's something that we need to educate people on,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   and we need to believe in people's intelligence and ability to take this responsibility.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   In China, they still have in some areas, and they used to have bone setters.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   They didn't put you in a cast.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   You broke your hand or they did it through bone setting.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And yeah, they didn't have x-ray.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   So that's a lot more complex to do and not as successful as nowadays.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   But having said that, they did achieve amazing rates of recovery
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   because these reps that they use and the process allows some form of movement.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And that creates an adaptation.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Now take an arm, a healthy arm, your right arm, put it in a cast for six months.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Take down the cast. What do you see?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   The opposite of that.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   The arm is basically moving towards death.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Yes, it's gotten good at not moving.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   The arm is gray. You have weird hairs growing out of it.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   It stinks. It really smells and looks like death because movement is life.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   No movement, death.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   We know that.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   We like to just kill your arm a tiny bit so the bones can reform together
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   and then we'll bring it back to life.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   That's one approach.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   But in other cases, you can maintain the life and the demands on the tissue safely enough
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   at the same time allow the recovery to happen.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Yes.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And diet.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   What are some diet principles you follow?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Well, diet is a very individual thing.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   I've been personally following a Paleolithic, a caveman diet for a long time,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   long before it was called the Paleo diet and since 1997 or even '96.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I've been doing this for a long time.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   I feel great on it.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Still growing older and older and functioning only better and being able to sustain, maintain, improve.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   But diet is very, very individual.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   There is a lot of exploration to be done there.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   What you can withstand, how resilient is your system.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Nowadays, there is a new movement towards not improving the fuel sources,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   not improving the quality and the quantities of the food,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   but actually making the system more resilient.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   So it's able to basically withstand almost any quality and source.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And that's where we have been lacking.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   And we've been neglecting this area.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And that's something that I believe is the latest innovation,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   although it's still highly misunderstood.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And a lot of folks are abusing this concept and giving really poor advice just to be different,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   just to say, "I'm not the Paleo guy."
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   So that's a small addition that will get bigger and bigger, I think.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   So it's almost like how you recommend in movement to go outside of "proper alignment."
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   The diet version of that is going outside of some kind of proper framework of diet.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   To some level, but that was an obvious thing, you know, always.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   The problem is it's not enough because it's more what I'm suggesting with movement,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   to go outside of "proper alignment," it creates an adaptation.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   But what if that adaptation cannot happen?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   For example, a celiac disease person, you'll expose him to gluten,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   and he'll have terrible consequences.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Now, maybe if you can minimize enough the amounts and the dosages,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   you can actually train him out of celiac to some level.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   But that adaptation is not going to last very far down the road.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   He's going to get some gains, and then he's going to plateau.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   But what if you could take that celiac disease person, put him in the garage,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   fix his mechanisms, change his tires, change his engine, you know, oil him up, everything,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   and then put him back on the track as a new animal?
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And that is where a lot of stuff is happening nowadays.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   So the genetic part of it and the gut biome, our digestive tract that is so, so complex,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   and we discover that, you know, we live in symbiosis with all these microorganisms
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   that just are all over our skin inside of us, and we live in combination with them.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   And that's how you see some dudes in Brazil and in Russia
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   walking around with, you know, 5% body fat, eating one cracker for breakfast,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   one cracker for dinner, and, you know, training BJJ all day long,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   high performance, fueling with Coca-Cola.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   And then at the same time, you see people doing everything almost perfectly
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   and still having poor performance and inability,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   and they gain weight with any, you know, extra calorie or macronutrient they brought in
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   because their system is different.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   And it's not only about genetics.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   It's more about epigenetics, and it's more about what kind of system,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   besides your own DNA, what about these organisms that are supposed to help you
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   and live in symbiosis with you, what kind of a system do you have there?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   And that's just two areas, and I think it's going to expand more and more and more,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   and we're going to realize that there is a lot to learn there.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Do you think technology and science is ultimately a positive force for--
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   you know, you look at movement as an element of our humanity.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Do you think technology is taking humanity away or is adding to it?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   I'm not smart enough to answer you that, man.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Yeah, it's a big question.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   You know, I have no idea.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   It's just--it's a huge question, and I think we're going to struggle with that question
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   for many generations to come still.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   It's definitely created a lot of positive stuff,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   but it's also brought tremendous suffering and problems,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   and perhaps will be the end of us.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   So technology might have been the most terrible thing that ever happened to us.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Who knows?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Yes, on that beautiful note, how can people join the Ido Portal movement?
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Do you have a website, idoportal.com?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Yeah, idoportal.com.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   We are on Facebook.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   You can find us on Facebook, the Ido Portal Method, Ido Portal, IDOPORTAL.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   You can join the movement culture on our website,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   and that will lead to some updates coming up soon.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   You have a beautiful website, by the way, amazing website.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   I've been very fortunate to have a great team around me that helped me with that.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I saw that you posted a couple of Tom Waits songs,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   and even a Bukowski reference on your Facebook page,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   and I immediately understood something that I think only another fan
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   or maybe I should say student of Waits and Bukowski can understand.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   You don't shy away from the strange and the profound, wherever you can find it.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Maybe that's one way to put it.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Is there a Tom Waits song that you find yourself returning to often in your life?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   So many, man, so many.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   It's just--Tom Waits, I can barely listen to anything else, frankly.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   It's been a real issue, and Tom Waits, his discography,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   it's a lifetime of discoveries.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   It's been accompanying me for years now.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   It's not something you go through very quickly.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   I've spent a lot of time on Alice, for example, and yeah,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   just so much stuff, so much stuff you always discover.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Also, I find that this weirdness, this eccentric part of things,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   it's so important.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   It's the only thing, really, that can be you in many ways
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   because as a culture, we're so bland.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   We're becoming this one thing.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   You walk around in London, it looks exactly like Hong Kong.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   It looks exactly like Tokyo.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   It looks exactly like Sydney.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   We have this huge human thing going on, which is great,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   and we communicate very easily, but then we lost a lot on our own stuff.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   There is only one Tom Waits because of his eccentric part
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   and because of his weird genius, and that's why it's so beautiful to me.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I try not to shy away from my own eccentric side.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   When I was younger, I definitely hid that part more and guarded
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and tried to fit in, but that's definitely an important thing, I think.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   So you recommend we cultivate the weird.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Yeah, cultivating the weird is cultivating yourself
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   because that's truly you.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Everybody's weird.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Everybody.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   There is no Homer Simpson.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Everybody has this part.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Everybody has this interesting stuff.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   That's what also interests me when I teach.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   I want to see that weird.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   I want to see that weird in your movement.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   I want to see that weird in you, and then I really met you,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   but most people, they hide it, and they don't allow--
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   and they put this perfect picture, but it's--
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I'm not stupid.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I know it's not perfect, you know?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   So just allow the weirdness to come out.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I think it's a great lesson from Waits and Bukowski as well.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   So if you don't mind, I'm going to torture you with something.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I would like to close by reading a Bukowski poem, "Roll the Dice,"
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   and I'm going to force you to listen to it.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Go ahead.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   If you're going to try, go all the way.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Otherwise, don't even start.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs, maybe your mind.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   It could mean not eating for three or four days.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   It could mean freezing on a park bench.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   It could mean jail.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   It could mean derision.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   It could mean mockery, isolation.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Isolation is the gift.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   All the others are a test of your endurance,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   of how much you really want to do it, and you'll do it,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   despite rejection and the worst odds,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   and it will be better than anything else you can imagine.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   If you're going to try, go all the way.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   There's no other feeling like that.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   You will ride life straight to perfect laughter.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   It's the only good fight there is.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Amen.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Thanks, Ido. Thanks for talking to me, man.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Thank you so much, man.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Appreciate it.
