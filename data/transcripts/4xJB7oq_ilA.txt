[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Intro music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   How do I know if I'm living by faith or living in unbelief?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.320]   Is there a more important question to the daily Christian life? It's a question from a listener named Daniel.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.040]   "Hello Pastor John, Romans 14 23 says that whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.860]   Could it be said that anything that does proceed from faith glorifies God? Is that also true?
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.760]   If so, how do I know if what I'm doing proceeds from faith or unbelief?
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480]   I know this seems really basic, but it's also really abstract to me too.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760]   I really don't know how to distinguish an act done from faith and an act done from unbelief.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.060]   Any help would be greatly appreciated to help me understand this distinction."
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:52.200]   This is a really basic and very important question for living the Christian life in a way that brings
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.360]   Spirit-given peace to the soul and glory to God and good to the world.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:17.160]   All of that, I think, hangs on what it means to "walk by faith" or "live by faith" or "perform the obedience of faith" or "do the works of faith."
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.760]   All four of those are biblical ways of talking about what Daniel is asking about.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.240]   How do you do a thing by faith as opposed to do a thing and it's sin when you do it?
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.000]   Same thing, same act. So that's what the Christian life is.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840]   Before we were born again, we did nothing from faith.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.200]   After we are born again, faith in Jesus as our Redeemer, faith in God as our Father Provider,
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.960]   faith in the Holy Spirit as the power that enables to do something—that's how we live.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.880]   That's how we do things. We lean on Father, Son, Holy Spirit to do their work in regard to our life.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:08.840]   So Daniel points out in his question that Romans 14.23 says, "Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin."
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.400]   Now that's right, and it has huge implications.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:26.280]   It shows that the deeds which externally conform to God's commands—like don't kill, don't steal, don't lie, be kind, don't return evil for evil—
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:40.440]   those external acts might conform to God's will but may be sinful because they may be done from a heart that is not trusting Jesus or the Father or the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.280]   Now that is a radical, God-centered statement about the nature of real virtue.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.200]   Virtue is not external conformity to God's law.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:03.000]   Virtue is conformity to God's law that comes from reliance upon God's love and forgiveness and wisdom and power.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.920]   You see this not only in Romans 14.23 but also in Hebrews 11.6 where it says, "Without faith it is impossible to please God."
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.320]   So nothing we do, no matter how kind it is or how good it is or how it looks on the outside,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:33.240]   none of it is pleasing to God if it's not coming from trust in God's forgiveness and guidance and power.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.520]   You can picture how this works in your own experience.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.480]   Suppose I say to my teenage son, which they're all grown up now, so not picking on any one of them in particular.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.120]   If I say to my teenage son, who wants to use the car to go to a basketball game tonight,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.040]   and he says, "Dad, can I use the car tonight?" I said, "Sure, not a problem.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.560]   Just would you be sure to wash it before you go, just for the family so we have it clean for the weekend?"
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.440]   And he's angry at me for asking him to do that, and he goes into his room and slams the door.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.800]   I said, "Oh my goodness, what did I just touch?"
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.920]   And then suppose half an hour later I see him out in the driveway with the hose turned on washing the car.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:26.760]   And all the while, while he's washing it, is angry and bitter and resentful toward his dad for making him do this.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.640]   Is his father pleased by that obedience? And the answer is no. He's heartbroken.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:42.840]   He's not pleased. He's heartbroken at this attitude of mere external conformity while he's stewing on the inside
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.520]   without any appreciation or a desire to please his dad.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.960]   That's what it means when it says, "Even if you conform outwardly to God's law, it is sin."
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:05.880]   Then Daniel asks whether the reverse is true, that doing something from faith does please God and does glorify God,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.520]   and the answer is a resounding yes, because Paul says in Romans 4:20,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.960]   "Abraham grew strong in his faith, giving glory to God."
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:24.200]   My interpretation of that is it was precisely the strengthening of his faith and his acting in faith
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.960]   that drew attention to the glory of God's grace and power in his life.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.040]   And then 1 Peter says the same thing, 1 Peter 4:11, "Whoever serves, let him do it, let him serve,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:48.760]   as one who serves by the strength that God supplies, in order that in everything God may be glorified."
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.520]   Now, I take that to mean that in every kind of obedience service, we perform in reliance.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:04.760]   We trust God for the strength and the wisdom and the wherewithal to do what we're called to do,
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.960]   and if we rely upon God as we obey and serve, God gets the glory.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.200]   He says, "The giver of the strength gets the glory for the service."
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.760]   That's what 1 Peter 4:11 says.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.080]   We used to quote that over and over again in our prayer room just before we walked into preaching.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.760]   The more we rely upon power and wisdom from God for our obedience,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.680]   the more he will get the glory for our obedience.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:43.800]   So Daniel asks, finally, "How do you identify a deed done from faith as opposed to a good deed
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:53.960]   done from unbelief? What is it like to do something from faith when you might do that very same thing
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.720]   from lack of faith, unbelief? What are the marks?"
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:08.920]   And I'll give you what I think is probably the most important passage or text in the Bible
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:16.280]   to answer that question, and I think it's that important because it gives three clear marks
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.680]   of a deed done as a work of faith.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.400]   In fact, that very phrase is used.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.520]   2 Thessalonians 1:11-12.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.000]   Here it goes.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:39.880]   "We always pray for you that our God may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:51.080]   by his power so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you in him
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.800]   according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus."
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.000]   Oh, my, my, my.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.400]   I encourage everybody, everybody to meditate on every single phrase in those two verses.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.240]   Here's the answer that they give to Daniel's question.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:20.200]   A work of faith, a deed done in reliance upon God will have these three elements.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.840]   Number one, it involves a resolve for good.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:33.480]   In other words, our choices, our active mental volitional efforts to be involved in God's will,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:42.680]   our choices are involved when we bring our decisions into conformity with the good that
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.640]   is in God's Word.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:50.520]   So we measure the things we're about to do by what's good, and that is decided by God's Word.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.960]   Second, a work of faith involves trusting God's power to enable us to do it, or as he says at
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.760]   the end of the verse, trusting God's grace.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:09.320]   And that's true whether it is a deed like faithfulness in martyrdom or brushing your teeth.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.920]   We cannot do either of those.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:21.400]   If our eyes are open, we know we cannot do either of those apart from God's grace, God's power.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.360]   Faith gladly knows that, rests in that.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.880]   And number three, the third mark of a work of faith is that it aims at the glory of the name
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.720]   of the Lord Jesus.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:41.640]   So to live by faith or to walk by faith or to do the works of faith means, one, the thing we aim
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.520]   at is shaped by God's Word, and it is good.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.320]   Two, the strength to do it is the power of God, and we trust in it.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.200]   Third, the aim of the act is make Christ look glorious.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.760]   Or to say it one more way, acting by faith means, one, what we do is shaped by the Word of God.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:15.240]   How we do it is in the power of God, and the aim in doing it is the glory of God.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:23.960]   That's what changes a so-called good deed from being sinful and displeasing to God into an act
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.880]   that is truly virtuous and pleasing to God.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:34.840]   A resolve for good, trusting in God to enable us, all aimed at Christ's honor.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.640]   The Word of God, power of God, glory of God.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.920]   That's a really helpful little triad, easy to remember.

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.760]   Is such a conclusion a leap or is it logical?
